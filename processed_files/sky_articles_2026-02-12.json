        "Content": "\n          Sports correspondent\n              @RobHarris\n It took 23 hours but Manchester United did distance themselves from Sir Jim Ratcliffe's rhetoric on immigration. Without naming the part-owner, a statement insisting they \"remain deeply committed\" to \"equality, diversity and inclusion\" was effectively a public rebuke. Remember, Sir Jim only owns just under 30% of the club, despite the investment gaining control of football operations two years ago and the INEOS billionaire becoming the face of decision-making. The majority owners are still the six Glazer siblings, whose grandparents were Lithuanian Jewish immigrants to the United States. We haven't heard from them directly, but the statement issued on the club website is as close as we can get to detecting their view of Sir Jim's complaint in a Sky News interview that \"the UK has been colonised by immigrants\". United highlighted how Manchester is a city \"anyone can call home\", extolling how the club boasts a \"diverse group of players, staff and global community of supporters\". Sir Jim's own apology statement made no mention of diversity and inclusion. \n                  Manchester United call themselves an 'inclusive and welcoming' club day after co-owner says UK 'colonised' by immigrants\n                 \n                  Who is Sir Jim Ratcliffe? The billionaire co-owner of Manchester United facing backlash over immigration comments\n                 \n                  Sir Jim Ratcliffe's immigration outburst risks antagonising those inside and out of Man Utd\n                 Only 20 words were spent apologising - \"I am sorry that my choice of language has offended some people in the UK and Europe and caused concern\" - another 90 words were used to reassert the need for curbs on immigration. That is a concern shared by three leading parties - Reform, Labour and the Conservatives - but it is demonising immigrants, claiming they have colonised the country, that has proved so inflammatory. We don't know if Manchester mayor Andy Burnham has accepted Sir Jim's apology - and how it impacts their work on the Old Trafford redevelopment project - but the day began with him denouncing \"portraying those who come here as a hostile invading force\". Sir Jim could yet face an FA charge for bringing the game into disrepute as the governing body looks into his outburst and whether the language was discriminatory. While the bulk of the interview focused on business and economic interests, Sir Jim did bring it back to his football role when expressing concerns about the levels of immigration. \"I've been very unpopular at Manchester United because we've made lots of changes,\" he said, adding: \"You've got all the same issues with the country. If you really want to deal with the major issues of immigration.\" Piara Powar, executive director of the FARE network, told Sky News that Sir Jim's language risks \"escalating hate\". The leading football anti-racism activist told Sky News: \"He's now using his platform as a co-owner of Manchester United to put that out there, and that's a very dangerous precedent. \"So if the FA don't look at it very seriously... that then leads us into a dangerous road with owners using the purchase of football clubs as a political platform.\" And what about the fans, particularly those from diverse communities, who can fear discrimination still at matches? Manchester United Muslim Supporters' Club chair Asif Mahmud is concerned about those threatening minority communities now feeling more empowered. He asked: \"Will comments like what Sir Jim has said give power and strength to those who feel we don't belong here?\" For Preetam Singh of the Stretford Sikhs fans' group, Sir Jim still has more work to do demonstrating any contrition. He said: \"It was a very half-hearted apology, more of a justification of what he said yesterday. So I would expect, and I would hope, he and the club would maybe come out and make a statement with a proper apology.\" Read more from Sky News:Parents speak as ex-nursery worker jailed for sex abuseBrain chips reach 'tipping point', says leading scientist Fans are still waiting. And this goes beyond reputational damage for Manchester United.

        "Content": "\n          Security and Defence Editor\n              @haynesdeborah\n The UK and its European allies are scrambling to get serious about their own defences as Donald Trump, Xi Jinping and Vladimir Putin shape a new world order. You can expect to hear multiple declarations from European leaders, including Sir Keir Starmer, about their respective plans to ramp up spending on defence and security at a major security conference in Munich over the next three days. But the key indicator to track is evidence of the rhetoric becoming cold, hard fighting reality. It is certainly what the United States will be looking for - a form of scrutiny that became clear at a separate meeting of defence ministers from the NATO alliance in Brussels on Thursday. Elbridge Colby, the US under secretary of war policy - a deputy to Pete Hegseth who chose to miss the gathering in what some insiders saw as a signal of the US reducing the priority it places on its NATO membership, though others denied this was the case - delivered a striking speech to allies. He said Europe must take the lead in defending itself, but - in words that will come as some relief to his counterparts - stressed that the US was not abandoning NATO. \"The world that shaped the habits, assumptions, and force posture of NATO during the so-called 'unipolar moment' following the Cold War no longer exists,\" Mr Colby said. \n                  Veterans can be recalled for service until they are 65 under new measures\n                 \n                  PM says UK needs to be ready for war - but there is little sign of meaningful action behind the scenes\n                 \n                  UK has no plan for defending nation in event of war, military chief reveals\n                 \"Power politics has returned, and military force is again being employed at a large scale.\" The Trump administration official said his message was about giving a reality check to his partners, about the need to turn a pledge made at a major NATO summit last year to increase total defence and security spending to 5% of GDP into viable military capability. \"For Europe, it means moving beyond inputs and intentions toward outputs and capabilities,\" Mr Colby said. \"Defence spending levels matter, and there is no substitute for it. But what matters at the end of the day is what those resources produce: ready forces, usable munitions, resilient logistics, and integrated command structures that work at scale under stress. \"It means prioritising war-fighting effectiveness over bureaucratic and regulatory stasis. It means making hard choices about force structure, readiness, stockpiles, and industrial capacity that reflect the realities of modern conflict rather than peacetime politics.\" These words should be triggering alarm bells in London and other - in particular Western - European capitals that have for too long relied on spin over substance when it comes to talking about defence. The spending pledge last year comprises a commitment to increase spending on core defence to 3.5% of GDP by 2035, up from a target of 2%, with an additional 1.5% of GDP to be spent on an ill-defined bucket of wider security measures. Donald Trump applauded the move, which he rightly received credit for forcing through. However, the US president talks as though those levels of defence spending have already been met. In reality, many allies are planning to take advantage of the full ten-year timespan to reach the target - including the UK, even though it is a leading member of the alliance and a key partner of the United States. Mr Starmer's government is only planning to inch up core defence spending to 2.5% of GDP by next year, lift it to 3% by the next parliament, and only reach the full 5% by 2035. Defence sources say this is far too slow given the scale of the challenge to rebuild the UK's armed forces as well as wider national resilience. It is also, as Mr Colby said, not just about how much money a country spends but what the cash is spent on and whether input translates to credible military output. Again, on that point, the UK is seen to be falling short. Read more from Sky News:Parents speak as ex-nursery worker jailed for sex abuseDo latest AI resignations mean the world is in 'peril'? A plan for defence investment - due to be published last year - is yet to be revealed amid reports of a £28bn hole in the budget over the next four years. At a press conference following the NATO conference, I asked John Healey, the defence secretary, if the UK was failing to meet the moment. He strongly pushed back on this suggestion. \"The UK has always met its commitments to funding NATO,\" he said. \"The UK is putting more money into defence this year than it has done for 15 years - £270bn in this parliament alone. This is the largest increase since the end of the Cold War.\" But given that defence spending across NATO was repeatedly cut following the collapse of the Soviet Union, this is perhaps not the best measure to judge whether what is being spent now is actually enough. And many believe that it is not."

        "Content": "\n          Climate reporter\n              @SeabrookClimate\n Donald Trump has just gone for the jugular of climate legislation. The US president has scrapped a scientific finding by the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) that greenhouse gas emissions endanger human health - the so-called \"endangerment finding\". If you want to gut federal climate action in the US, this is the big one to go for, because it is the legal basis for many other rules. Accepting that greenhouse gas emissions harm health - and scientists are clear they do, by way of air pollution, and extreme weather like heavy flooding - is what has justified subsequent rules to clean up the sources of those emissions. He has also repealed rules on emissions standards for all vehicles and engines. Transport is the biggest polluting sector in the US, famously a nation of drivers. If US transport was a country, it would be the sixth biggest polluter in the world. \n                  Social media ban: Have we reached a tipping point?\n                 \n                  Do the latest AI resignations actually mean the world is in 'peril'?\n                 \n                  'Tipping point' reached in creation of brain chips to help 'unlock' minds of people with paralysis\n                 That's bigger than the entire economies of Brazil or Indonesia. The big motivation for these changes is to cut costs. The White House stresses that these moves will save carmakers about $2,400 (£1,754) a car, and the economy $1.3trn (£954bn) a year. Environmentalists dispute these figures, saying that if cars are less fuel efficient, petrol bills will go up, and so will healthcare bills for asthma sufferers, or households cleaning up wildfire or flood damage. Read more on Sky News:Scramble to reach communities after floodsAntarctica's weird biology But the news has been welcomed by the fossil fuel industry, and Republicans who say the rules went too far by regulating emissions in a manner that side-stepped approval by Congress. Climate policies in the US always yo-yo under the Democrats and Republicans, the latter being far more sceptical. Environmentalists are now planning to challenge these rollbacks in court. But if they go through, it will make it much harder for anyone to ever bring the limits on climate pollution back in again. ."

        "Content": "\n          Security and Defence Editor\n              @haynesdeborah\n Europe must take the lead in defending itself as the world becomes more militarised, but the US is not abandoning its NATO allies, a top American official has said. Elbridge Colby, the US Under Secretary of War, said the alliance must be prepared for potential enemies to strike simultaneously in different parts of the globe. This was why European members of NATO must take the \"primary responsibility\" when it comes to defending their homeland - as US forces are focused elsewhere. Ultimately, he said the alliance needs to become a modern version of its original Cold War status - defined by hard and credible fighting strength. Mr Colby, who was representing Secretary of War Pete Hegseth, made the comments at a meeting of NATO defence ministers in Brussels on Thursday. Allies have tried to play down his boss's absence as not signalling a reduction in US prioritisation of NATO. \"The world that shaped the habits, assumptions, and force posture of NATO during the so-called 'unipolar moment' following the Cold War no longer exists,\" Mr Colby said, according to a transcript of his remarks that were published by his department. \n                  Trial date set for Trump's $10bn lawsuit against BBC over Panorama edit\n                 \n                  Donald Trump agrees to end ICE operation in Minnesota\n                 \n                  Call to make NATO 'more European' - as key figure misses alliance summit\n                 \"Power politics has returned, and military force is again being employed at a large scale,\" he added. This meant that the United States, under Donald Trump, was prioritising the biggest threats to US interests - especially the defence of the US homeland and its interests in the Western Hemisphere. \"At the same time - and critically - the United States and its allies must be prepared for the possibility that potential opponents will act simultaneously across multiple theatres, whether in a coordinated fashion or opportunistically.\" Mark Rutte, the head of NATO, has previously raised the possibility of China making a move on Taiwan, which may draw in US forces, at the same time as Russia seeks to test NATO's Article 5 principle of collective defence by attacking a European member of the alliance. This could leave the Europeans and Canada to tackle Russian aggression alone or with only limited US support. Mr Elbridge said his message was about giving a reality check to his partners, not the US turning its back on NATO - something that allies have fretted about ever since Mr Trump returned to the White House. \"This is not an abandonment of NATO. To the contrary, it is a return to and validation of its foundational purpose,\" the official said. He recalled how the alliance, when it was established in 1949, was defined by \"a hard-nosed, realistic, clear-eyed approach to deterrence and defence. Allies from the beginning were expected to pull their weight\". This discipline was lost after the Cold War ended as priorities shifted to fighting wars in Afghanistan and Iraq - outside NATO territory. Mr Elbridge said the alliance must now become what he called NATO 3.0 - which was more akin to its original purpose. \"This 'NATO 3.0' requires much greater efforts by our allies to step up and assume primary responsibility for the conventional defence of Europe,\" he said.

But he said European leadership on defence must be durable. \"Europe must assume primary responsibility for its own conventional defence. This is not a matter of ideology or rhetorical flourish. It is a conclusion grounded in a clear-eyed and rigorous assessment of the strategic environment we face as well as a pragmatic evaluation of the capabilities at our disposal. \"At the same time, the United States must - and will - prioritise those theatres and challenges where only American power can play a decisive role.\" He said the move was \"not a retreat from Europe. It is, rather, an affirmation of strategic pragmatism and a recognition of our allies' undeniable ability to step up and lead on Europe's defence in a way that leaves all of us stronger and safer\"."

In September, the 32-year-old appeared at Southwark Crown Court to deny five counts of rape against two other women, and a charge of sexual assault against a third. Those alleged offences took place between 2021 and 2022, when he played for Arsenal. The Ghanaian midfielder, who now plays for Spanish club Villarreal, is due to face trial at the same court on 2 November. His lawyer previously said he \"denies all the charges against him\".

        "Content": "\n          Senior data journalist\n              @danieljdunford\n \"This government has cut waiting lists by more than 330,000, with hundreds of thousands more people treated within 18 weeks. That's not happening by chance – it's because we delivered record levels of care in 2025.\" That's what Health Secretary Wes Streeting told us on Thursday, celebrating the fact that there are now 7.3 million cases on the NHS England elective treatment waiting list. That waiting list remains 2.7 million cases longer than it was before COVID, and almost double what it was ten years ago. But as Mr Streeting says, it's down 330,000 in the 18 months since his party came to government. In the final year and a half of Rishi Sunak's government, it rose by more than 400,000. While that improvement is welcome, not all of what Mr Streeting said is strictly true. Not all of the fall in the number waiting is because the NHS delivered record levels of care in 2025. A significant proportion is because Labour has incentivised NHS Trusts to improve \"validation\" efforts - checking the list and removing cases that don't need to be there, even if they have not actually received any NHS care. These cases are known as \"unreported removals\" and they are not recorded in any official NHS data. Sky News analysis reveals that there have been 4.6 million such cases in the 18 months since Labour came to power, up from 4.3 million during the final 18 months of the previous government. The increase in unreported removals is responsible for about 17% of the total change in direction of the waiting list, with 83% thanks to increased clinical activity. If the number of unreported removals had remained the same as it was under the Conservatives, the waiting list would still have fallen, but by 110,000 rather than 330,000. Three of the most prominent UK health thinktanks - the Health Foundation, Nuffield Trust and The King's Fund - all told Sky News that while they welcome the fall to the waiting list, sustained improvements need to come from increased activity rather than data cleaning exercises. Each of them also criticised the lack of transparency around the unreported removals data. Responding to the comments, Chris Roebuck, head of profession for statistics at NHS England, said: \"Unreported removals have accounted for around 15% of patients who come off the waiting list for decades - they are actually lower now than before the pandemic and it is the record level of operations, tests and scans being delivered by NHS staff that is now getting the waiting list down. \"Validation is not new and does not mean patients miss out on care - it is a routine clinical process that ensures people needing specialist care aren't stuck behind patients left on the list in error or who no longer need treatment.\" Record highs for \"trolley waits\" at A&E Other data released by the NHS on Thursday reveals that the state of NHS England emergency care in January was by one measure the worst since records began. More than 71,000 people had \"trolley waits\" longer than 12 hours in January. A trolley wait is a wait to be admitted to hospital after a decision had been made in A&E that the patient needed to be admitted. That's the highest number since current records began in 2010, and more in one month than the total number of 12 hour waits recorded over more than eleven years between August 2010 and November 2021. There were also more than 160,000 trolley waits longer than four hours in January, which was also the highest monthly figure on record.

        "Content": "\n          Sports correspondent\n              @RobHarris\n It took 23 hours but Manchester United did distance themselves from Sir Jim Ratcliffe's rhetoric on immigration. Without naming the part-owner, a statement insisting they \"remain deeply committed\" to \"equality, diversity and inclusion\" was effectively a public rebuke. Remember, Sir Jim only owns just under 30% of the club, despite the investment gaining control of football operations two years ago and the INEOS billionaire becoming the face of decision-making. The majority owners are still the six Glazer siblings, whose grandparents were Lithuanian Jewish immigrants to the United States. We haven't heard from them directly, but the statement issued on the club website is as close as we can get to detecting their view of Sir Jim's complaint in a Sky News interview that \"the UK has been colonised by immigrants\". United highlighted how Manchester is a city \"anyone can call home\", extolling how the club boasts a \"diverse group of players, staff and global community of supporters\". Sir Jim's own apology statement made no mention of diversity and inclusion. \n                  Manchester United call themselves an 'inclusive and welcoming' club day after co-owner says UK 'colonised' by immigrants\n                 \n                  Who is Sir Jim Ratcliffe? The billionaire co-owner of Manchester United facing backlash over immigration comments\n                 \n                  Sir Jim Ratcliffe's immigration outburst risks antagonising those inside and out of Man Utd\n                 Only 20 words were spent apologising - \"I am sorry that my choice of language has offended some people in the UK and Europe and caused concern\" - another 90 words were used to reassert the need for curbs on immigration. That is a concern shared by three leading parties - Reform, Labour and the Conservatives - but it is demonising immigrants, claiming they have colonised the country, that has proved so inflammatory. We don't know if Manchester mayor Andy Burnham has accepted Sir Jim's apology - and how it impacts their work on the Old Trafford redevelopment project - but the day began with him denouncing \"portraying those who come here as a hostile invading force\". Sir Jim could yet face an FA charge for bringing the game into disrepute as the governing body looks into his outburst and whether the language was discriminatory. While the bulk of the interview focused on business and economic interests, Sir Jim did bring it back to his football role when expressing concerns about the levels of immigration. \"I've been very unpopular at Manchester United because we've made lots of changes,\" he said, adding: \"You've got all the same issues with the country. If you really want to deal with the major issues of immigration.\" Piara Powar, executive director of the FARE network, told Sky News that Sir Jim's language risks \"escalating hate\". The leading football anti-racism activist told Sky News: \"He's now using his platform as a co-owner of Manchester United to put that out there, and that's a very dangerous precedent. \"So if the FA don't look at it very seriously... that then leads us into a dangerous road with owners using the purchase of football clubs as a political platform.\" And what about the fans, particularly those from diverse communities, who can fear discrimination still at matches? Manchester United Muslim Supporters' Club chair Asif Mahmud is concerned about those threatening minority communities now feeling more empowered. He asked: \"Will comments like what Sir Jim has said give power and strength to those who feel we don't belong here?\" For Preetam Singh of the Stretford Sikhs fans' group, Sir Jim still has more work to do demonstrating any contrition. He said: \"It was a very half-hearted apology, more of a justification of what he said yesterday. So I would expect, and I would hope, he and the club would maybe come out and make a statement with a proper apology.\" Read more from Sky News:Parents speak as ex-nursery worker jailed for sex abuseBrain chips reach 'tipping point', says leading scientist Fans are still waiting.

        "Content": "\n          Security and Defence Editor\n              @haynesdeborah\n The UK and its European allies are scrambling to get serious about their own defences as Donald Trump, Xi Jinping and Vladimir Putin shape a new world order. You can expect to hear multiple declarations from European leaders, including Sir Keir Starmer, about their respective plans to ramp up spending on defence and security at a major security conference in Munich over the next three days. But the key indicator to track is evidence of the rhetoric becoming cold, hard fighting reality. It is certainly what the United States will be looking for - a form of scrutiny that became clear at a separate meeting of defence ministers from the NATO alliance in Brussels on Thursday. Elbridge Colby, the US under secretary of war policy - a deputy to Pete Hegseth who chose to miss the gathering in what some insiders saw as a signal of the US reducing the priority it places on its NATO membership, though others denied this was the case - delivered a striking speech to allies. He said Europe must take the lead in defending itself, but - in words that will come as some relief to his counterparts - stressed that the US was not abandoning NATO. \"The world that shaped the habits, assumptions, and force posture of NATO during the so-called 'unipolar moment' following the Cold War no longer exists,\" Mr Colby said. \n                  Veterans can be recalled for service until they are 65 under new measures\n                 \n                  PM says UK needs to be ready for war - but there is little sign of meaningful action behind the scenes\n                 \n                  UK has no plan for defending nation in event of war, military chief reveals\n                 \"Power politics has returned, and military force is again being employed at a large scale.\" The Trump administration official said his message was about giving a reality check to his partners, about the need to turn a pledge made at a major NATO summit last year to increase total defence and security spending to 5% of GDP into viable military capability. \"For Europe, it means moving beyond inputs and intentions toward outputs and capabilities,\" Mr Colby said. \"Defence spending levels matter, and there is no substitute for it. But what matters at the end of the day is what those resources produce: ready forces, usable munitions, resilient logistics, and integrated command structures that work at scale under stress. \"It means prioritising war-fighting effectiveness over bureaucratic and regulatory stasis. It means making hard choices about force structure, readiness, stockpiles, and industrial capacity that reflect the realities of modern conflict rather than peacetime politics.\" These words should be triggering alarm bells in London and other - in particular Western - European capitals that have for too long relied on spin over substance when it comes to talking about defence. The spending pledge last year comprises a commitment to increase spending on core defence to 3.5% of GDP by 2035, up from a target of 2%, with an additional 1.5% of GDP to be spent on an ill-defined bucket of wider security measures. Donald Trump applauded the move, which he rightly received credit for forcing through. However, the US president talks as though those levels of defence spending have already been met. In reality, many allies are planning to take advantage of the full ten-year timespan to reach the target - including the UK, even though it is a leading member of the alliance and a key partner of the United States. Mr Starmer's government is only planning to inch up core defence spending to 2.5% of GDP by next year, lift it to 3% by the next parliament, and only reach the full 5% by 2035. Defence sources say this is far too slow given the scale of the challenge to rebuild the UK's armed forces as well as wider national resilience. It is also, as Mr Colby said, not just about how much money a country spends but what the cash is spent on and whether input translates to credible military output. Again, on that point, the UK is seen to be falling short. Read more from Sky News:Parents speak as ex-nursery worker jailed for sex abuseDo latest AI resignations mean the world is in 'peril'? A plan for defence investment - due to be published last year - is yet to be revealed amid reports of a £28bn hole in the budget over the next four years. At a press conference following the NATO conference, I asked John Healey, the defence secretary, if the UK was failing to meet the moment. He strongly pushed back on this suggestion. \"The UK has always met its commitments to funding NATO,\" he said. \"The UK is putting more money into defence this year than it has done for 15 years - £270bn in this parliament alone. This is the largest increase since the end of the Cold War.\" But given that defence spending across NATO was repeatedly cut following the collapse of the Soviet Union, this is perhaps not the best measure to judge whether what is being spent now is actually enough. And many believe that it is not."

        "Content": "Cabinet secretary Sir Chris Wormald - the UK's most senior civil servant - is leaving No 10 in the wake of the recent Downing Street crisis. In a statement, the Cabinet Office said the prime minister and the cabinet secretary have agreed Sir Chris will stand down \"by mutual agreement\" from today. He replaced Simon Case in the £200,000-a-year role on 16 December 2024. His departure on Thursday makes him the shortest-serving cabinet secretary in history. The role will now be shared by three senior civil servants until a replacement is appointed, and it leaves Sir Keir Starmer without a permanent cabinet secretary, chief of staff, or director of communications - roles that have all been vacated in less than a week. Politics latest: No 'thank you' for Starmer in Wormald's departure note Sir Chris said: \"It has been an honour and a privilege to serve as a civil servant for the past 35 years, and a particular distinction to lead the service as cabinet secretary. \"I want to place on record my sincere thanks to the extraordinary civil servants, public servants, ministers, and advisers I have worked with.

I wish him the very best for the future.\" Third No 10 departure in less than a week The cabinet secretary is the head of the Civil Service, and is often a key adviser to the prime minister on major policy decisions and the internal workings of the government. At the time of his appointment 14 months ago, Sir Keir said Sir Chris would be tasked with \"the complete re-wiring of the British state to deliver bold and ambitious long-term reform\", and there was \"no one better placed\" to deliver that than him. However, there have been reports for months that the prime minister was unhappy with his performance, and his departure comes as little surprise to many in Whitehall, and comes on the heels of Morgan McSweeney leaving as Downing Street chief of staff and Tim Allan as communications director following the crisis of Sir Keir's premiership in the last week. Reacting to Sir Chris's ousting, Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch said he is \"the latest person Keir Starmer has thrown under the bus to save his own skin\". And Dave Penman, the leader of the FDA union that represents civil servants, called the treatment of Sir Chris a \"new low for this government and its relationship with the civil service\". He highlighted that briefing against Wormald began shortly after he took office and were started to \"scapegoat him and undermine his authority\". The responsibilities of the job will be shared in the interim between three senior civil servants - Catherine Little, permanent secretary at the Cabinet Office, James Bowler, permanent secretary at the Treasury, and Dame Antonia Romeo, permanent secretary at the Home Office, and widely reported to be the prime minister's preferred candidate to take on the role permanently. An appointment is expected to be made \"shortly\", the Cabinet Office said."

        "Content": "Police investigating the disappearance of a man from Leicester last seen more than a year ago, have started digging at a property in the city. Detectives have arrested 11 people on suspicion of murder. In a statement on Thursday, they named the missing man as 60-year-old Gary Piatek, who has been missing since April 2024. Building machinery and digging teams are involved in a thorough search at an address in Broad Avenue in Evington, east of the city centre, as part of the inquiry into Mr Piatek's disappearance, Leicestershire Police said. Nine suspects arrested on Tuesday remain in police custody, the force said in a statement on Thursday. Officers believe there has been \"no proof of life\" of Mr Piatek since April 2024 and \"specialist support is being provided to a number of his close friends\". The statement warned locals to expect a significant amount of police activity at the address over the coming days and weeks, including specially trained search officers, building machinery and crime scene investigators. \n                  Murder investigation launched after student stabbed in Leicester\n                 \n                  Academic who sued Steve Coogan over Richard III film says he hasn't received an apology \n                 \n                  More arrests after car 'collided with number of pedestrians' in Leicester\n                 Senior Investigating Officer, Detective Inspector Michael Chandler, from the East Midlands Special Operations Unit, appealed for the public's help as detectives \"establish the full circumstances of what has happened to Mr Piatek\".

        "Content": "\n          Security and Defence Editor\n              @haynesdeborah\n Europe must take the lead in defending itself as the world becomes more militarised, but the US is not abandoning its NATO allies, a top American official has said. Elbridge Colby, the US Under Secretary of War, said the alliance must be prepared for potential enemies to strike simultaneously in different parts of the globe. This was why European members of NATO must take the \"primary responsibility\" when it comes to defending their homeland - as US forces are focused elsewhere. Ultimately, he said the alliance needs to become a modern version of its original Cold War status - defined by hard and credible fighting strength. Mr Colby, who was representing Secretary of War Pete Hegseth, made the comments at a meeting of NATO defence ministers in Brussels on Thursday. Allies have tried to play down his boss's absence as not signalling a reduction in US prioritisation of NATO. \"The world that shaped the habits, assumptions, and force posture of NATO during the so-called 'unipolar moment' following the Cold War no longer exists,\" Mr Colby said, according to a transcript of his remarks that were published by his department. \n                  Trial date set for Trump's $10bn lawsuit against BBC over Panorama edit\n                 \n                  Donald Trump agrees to end ICE operation in Minnesota\n                 \n                  Call to make NATO 'more European' - as key figure misses alliance summit\n                 \"Power politics has returned, and military force is again being employed at a large scale,\" he added. This meant that the United States, under Donald Trump, was prioritising the biggest threats to US interests - especially the defence of the US homeland and its interests in the Western Hemisphere. \"At the same time - and critically - the United States and its allies must be prepared for the possibility that potential opponents will act simultaneously across multiple theatres, whether in a coordinated fashion or opportunistically.\" Mark Rutte, the head of NATO, has previously raised the possibility of China making a move on Taiwan, which may draw in US forces, at the same time as Russia seeks to test NATO's Article 5 principle of collective defence by attacking a European member of the alliance. This could leave the Europeans and Canada to tackle Russian aggression alone or with only limited US support. Mr Elbridge said his message was about giving a reality check to his partners, not the US turning its back on NATO - something that allies have fretted about ever since Mr Trump returned to the White House. \"This is not an abandonment of NATO. To the contrary, it is a return to and validation of its foundational purpose,\" the official said. He recalled how the alliance, when it was established in 1949, was defined by \"a hard-nosed, realistic, clear-eyed approach to deterrence and defence. Allies from the beginning were expected to pull their weight\". This discipline was lost after the Cold War ended as priorities shifted to fighting wars in Afghanistan and Iraq - outside NATO territory. Mr Elbridge said the alliance must now become what he called NATO 3.0 - which was more akin to its original purpose. \"This 'NATO 3.0' requires much greater efforts by our allies to step up and assume primary responsibility for the conventional defence of Europe,\" he said. Read more on Sky News:NATO should 'be more European'New threat of Putin's hypersonic missileUK 'must step up' to deter Russian threat The Under Secretary of War praised allies for heeding Mr Trump's calls to commit to increase defence and wider security spending to 5% of GDP - up from an original goal for defence spending of 2%. But he said European leadership on defence must be durable. \"Europe must assume primary responsibility for its own conventional defence. This is not a matter of ideology or rhetorical flourish. It is a conclusion grounded in a clear-eyed and rigorous assessment of the strategic environment we face as well as a pragmatic evaluation of the capabilities at our disposal. \"At the same time, the United States must - and will - prioritise those theatres and challenges where only American power can play a decisive role.\" He said the move was \"not a retreat from Europe. It is, rather, an affirmation of strategic pragmatism and a recognition of our allies' undeniable ability to step up and lead on Europe's defence in a way that leaves all of us stronger and safer\"."

        "Content": "A teenage girl will become the next leader of North Korea, with Kim Jong Un set to confirm his daughter as successor, spy chiefs believe. The announcement could come at party congress, the country's largest political gathering, which is set to be held later this month after a five-year hiatus. Ahead of the conference, Mr Kim seems to be taking steps to consolidate his daughter's position as successor, according to South Korea's National Intelligence Agency (NIS). Believed to be named Kim Ju Ae, the girl has become increasingly prominent in North Korean propaganda and even seems to have an input on policy, the NIS said. Intelligence officials briefed members of the South Korean parliament on the child's evolving status in a closed-door session this week. Lee Seong-kweun of the People Power Party said: \"In the past, the NIS described Kim Ju Ae as being 'in study as successor'. \"But today the expression used was that she 'was in the stage of being internally appointed successor'.\" Park Sun-won of the Democratic Party said the girl was already being treated as the second-in-command, pointing to her public profile. He said the NIS would closely monitor whether she attends this month's congress, where the regime will set out its major policy goals for the coming years. Kim Ju Ae first stepped on to the public stage when she attended a missile launch with her father in November 2022. South Korean officials were initially sceptical about her status as successor, given North Korea's conservative, patriarchal culture. But recent appearances have forced a reassessment, with the girl accompanying her father to a summit with Chinese leader Xi Jinping last year. She was also photographed with her parents at Pyongyang's Kumsusan Palace of the Sun, where the embalmed bodies of her grandfather and great-grandfather are displayed. Cheong Seong-chang, a senior analyst at South Korea's Sejong Institute, said the girl could be appointed first secretary of the ruling party at congress.

For example, he said it might be claimed that North Korea had survived thanks to \"successful inheritance of the revolution\". \"If you see comments like that, it would be reasonable to think that Ju Ae has been cemented,\" he said."

Other allies were more diplomatic, playing down the no-show, though Germany's defence minister underlined the need for the alliance to become \"more European\" to remain transatlantic. The comments were made as defence ministers from the 32-nation bloc gathered at NATO headquarters on Thursday to discuss steps to increase European security one year after Mr Hegseth warned them that the United States was shifting its focus to other priorities and Europe needed to take the lead in defending itself. Sky News asked a number of ministers, as they arrived, what they thought about the secretary of war deciding not to return to NATO headquarters for this year's ministerial, instead sending Elbridge Colby, his deputy - and whether this was a signal that the United States was less interested in the security of Europe. Thorgerdur Katrin Gunnarsdottir, the foreign minister of Iceland, who is also responsible for defence, said: \"Sadly for him he is missing a good party. Of course, it is always better that the ministers attend here but I will not describe it as a bad signal.\" She said allies had already been tested earlier in the year when Donald Trump threatened to seize Greenland - even though it is part of the Kingdom of Denmark, a fellow member of NATO. Mark Rutte, the head of the alliance, defused that crisis when he spoke with the US president on the sidelines of a major economic forum in the Swiss ski resort of Davos, making clear that defending the Arctic is a core priority for all allies. \n                  Former spy chief on Mandelson, Ukraine, China and Trump\n                 \n                  Hong Kong leader celebrates Jimmy Lai's sentence - as plan to enhance security law published\n                 \n                  Relationship with United States is 'rock solid', Taiwan president insists  - despite Donald Trump's call with Xi Jinping\n                 On Wednesday, NATO announced an enhanced mission to protect the high north, called Arctic Sentry. The move appears designed to demonstrate to Mr Trump that the territory is well protected from threats from Russia and China. \"I think now the alliance is stronger than in the beginning of the year,\" the Icelandic foreign minister said. Boris Pistorius, the defence minister of Germany, which is hugely ramping up its defence spending in response to Mr Trump's demands, said he was \"not disappointed\" that his American counterpart had stayed away from the NATO meeting. Read more:Russia's hypersonic missile: A fresh threat to Europe and NATOEveryone in UK 'must step up' to deter Russian threat of war \"I know everybody, each of us had a full, full agenda,\" he told Sky News. Mr Pistorius said it was right that Europe played a much greater role in defending itself. \"The time has come that the Europeans take over more and more step by step in the years to come,\" he said. \"This is absolutely normal and natural. I understand, and I support this direction.\" Mr Pistorius said the main point for him was that the United States is a member of NATO and remains a member of NATO. But \"a key to keep NATO transatlantic, it is necessary to make it more European\"."

        "Content": "\n          Security and Defence Editor\n              @haynesdeborah\n The UK and its European allies are scrambling to get serious about their own defences as Donald Trump, Xi Jinping and Vladimir Putin shape a new world order. You can expect to hear multiple declarations from European leaders, including Sir Keir Starmer, about their respective plans to ramp up spending on defence and security at a major security conference in Munich over the next three days. But the key indicator to track is evidence of the rhetoric becoming cold, hard fighting reality. It is certainly what the United States will be looking for - a form of scrutiny that became clear at a separate meeting of defence ministers from the NATO alliance in Brussels on Thursday. Elbridge Colby, the US under secretary of war policy - a deputy to Pete Hegseth who chose to miss the gathering in what some insiders saw as a signal of the US reducing the priority it places on its NATO membership, though others denied this was the case - delivered a striking speech to allies. He said Europe must take the lead in defending itself, but - in words that will come as some relief to his counterparts - stressed that the US was not abandoning NATO. \"The world that shaped the habits, assumptions, and force posture of NATO during the so-called 'unipolar moment' following the Cold War no longer exists,\" Mr Colby said. \n                  Veterans can be recalled for service until they are 65 under new measures\n                 \n                  PM says UK needs to be ready for war - but there is little sign of meaningful action behind the scenes\n                 \n                  UK has no plan for defending nation in event of war, military chief reveals\n                 \"Power politics has returned, and military force is again being employed at a large scale.\" The Trump administration official said his message was about giving a reality check to his partners, about the need to turn a pledge made at a major NATO summit last year to increase total defence and security spending to 5% of GDP into viable military capability. \"For Europe, it means moving beyond inputs and intentions toward outputs and capabilities,\" Mr Colby said. \"Defence spending levels matter, and there is no substitute for it. But what matters at the end of the day is what those resources produce: ready forces, usable munitions, resilient logistics, and integrated command structures that work at scale under stress. \"It means prioritising war-fighting effectiveness over bureaucratic and regulatory stasis. It means making hard choices about force structure, readiness, stockpiles, and industrial capacity that reflect the realities of modern conflict rather than peacetime politics.\" These words should be triggering alarm bells in London and other - in particular Western - European capitals that have for too long relied on spin over substance when it comes to talking about defence. The spending pledge last year comprises a commitment to increase spending on core defence to 3.5% of GDP by 2035, up from a target of 2%, with an additional 1.5% of GDP to be spent on an ill-defined bucket of wider security measures. Donald Trump applauded the move, which he rightly received credit for forcing through. However, the US president talks as though those levels of defence spending have already been met. In reality, many allies are planning to take advantage of the full ten-year timespan to reach the target - including the UK, even though it is a leading member of the alliance and a key partner of the United States. Mr Starmer's government is only planning to inch up core defence spending to 2.5% of GDP by next year, lift it to 3% by the next parliament, and only reach the full 5% by 2035. Defence sources say this is far too slow given the scale of the challenge to rebuild the UK's armed forces as well as wider national resilience. It is also, as Mr Colby said, not just about how much money a country spends but what the cash is spent on and whether input translates to credible military output. Again, on that point, the UK is seen to be falling short. Read more from Sky News:Parents speak as ex-nursery worker jailed for sex abuseDo latest AI resignations mean the world is in 'peril'? A plan for defence investment - due to be published last year - is yet to be revealed amid reports of a £28bn hole in the budget over the next four years. At a press conference following the NATO conference, I asked John Healey, the defence secretary, if the UK was failing to meet the moment. He strongly pushed back on this suggestion. \"The UK has always met its commitments to funding NATO,\" he said. \"The UK is putting more money into defence this year than it has done for 15 years - £270bn in this parliament alone. This is the largest increase since the end of the Cold War.\" But given that defence spending across NATO was repeatedly cut following the collapse of the Soviet Union, this is perhaps not the best measure to judge whether what is being spent now is actually enough. And many believe that it is not."

The UN estimates 1,400 people were killed in less than two months.

Many will be seeing it as a test to assess the strength and impact of the youth vote and student movements in other parts of the world, like Nepal. In both countries, frustration over a lack of jobs and endemic corruption exploded, unseating long-established leaderships. But the truth is, it's the old guard looming large in this vote on the surface. The Bangladesh Nationalist Party is the frontrunner, the largest party, led by Tarique Rahman, son of the former PM Khaleda Zia. He is part of a well-established dynasty.

In December, the student-led National Citizens Party (NCP) made the controversial choice to ally with the much older party. The split within the youth vote could limit the political impact and influence of young voters. But there are a lot of them, about 45% of the 128 million registered voters are between the ages of 18 and 33, according to the Election Commission. Nobody yet knows what they will do, or the many Awami League voters unable to back their party. So far, there are some early indications of low voter turnout in Awami strongholds. But more broadly, there is also a lot of hope and optimism in the air in Bangladesh. There's a sense of excitement, people speaking freely about their hopes and that openness hasn't been on show in previous elections. Many believe this could be an era-defining vote after years of autocracy and a chance to experience a real contest that doesn't feel fixed. One trend to watch for is the role of rising anti-India sentiment. After years of good neighbourly relations, many voters, particularly young people, accuse Delhi of being overbearing and of supporting Hasina's regime at the expense of democracy."

More than 127 million people are eligible to vote in the country's first general election since Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina was toppled after weeks of protests. The unrest, sometimes dubbed the Gen Z uprising because of its young supporters, caused Hasina to flee the country for India, clearing the way for an interim government led by Muhammad Yunus. Bangladeshi courts have since sentenced Hasina to death for alleged crimes against humanity during the uprising. Her Awami League party is banned from running in the election. Hasina's niece, Labour MP Tulip Siddiq, has also been sentenced to jail - by a Bangladesh court in her absence - over corruption allegations, in a controversial judgement not recognised by the UK government. Siddiq has condemned the conviction, saying she is \"absolutely baffled by the whole thing\".

Opposing him is an 11-party alliance led by the country's largest Islamist party, Jamaat-e-Islami. Jamaat-e-Islami was banned under Hasina's rule, but Bangladesh is more than 90% Muslim, and the group has regained prominence since her removal. However, the party's conservative religious views have sparked concerns, especially among women and minority communities, that social freedoms could be eroded. The interim government of Yunus, a Nobel Peace Prize laureate, says it is committed to delivering a credible and transparent election. Some 500 international observers and foreign journalists will therefore be present, including delegations from the Commonwealth, to which Bangladesh belongs, and the EU. Outside a polling booth in Dhaka, mounted police were seen with saddle blankets proclaiming: \"Police are here, vote without fear\". Major reform proposals are also on the ballot in a referendum, including plans to add a second house to the Bangladeshi parliament or Jatiya Sangsad. Presently it comprises one chamber of 350 seats, with members elected to five-year terms. 300 seats represent constituencies, while 50 are reserved for women.

        "Content": "Dozens of people have been killed and thousands displaced after a cyclone hit Madagascar with gusts of up to 167mph. The trail of destruction left by Tropical Cyclone Gezani has caused at least 31 deaths, the country's disaster management office said. Four others are missing, 36 are seriously injured, and 6,870 are displaced, with more than 250,000 people classified as disaster victims in total, officials said. At its peak, the cyclone unleashed gusts of up to 167mph (270kph) - enough to tear metal sheeting from roofs and uproot large trees - with sustained winds of 115mph (185kph). It comes just days after another cyclone, Tropical Cyclone Fytia, wrought havoc in Madagascar, killing 14 people and displacing 85,000 more. Toamasina, the island nation's second-largest city, was the hardest hit by Gezani, with 29 people killed as homes collapsed beneath the onslaught. All told, 75% of the city's infrastructure was destroyed, according to the office of President Michael Randrianirina.

It looks like a catastrophic landscape.\" Red alerts were issued for several regions at risk of floods and landslides as the cyclone made landfall. Gezani weakened to a tropical storm as it moved inland on Wednesday, passing some 60 miles north of the capital, Antananarivo. But it's expected to pass into the Mozambique Channel, which separates Madagascar from mainland Africa, where forecasters warn it might strengthen again. Now the island faces the prospect of Gezani turning back and bringing fresh destruction to its southwest coast next week. Weather alerts have also been issued across the channel in Mozambique, where floods last month hit more than 700,000 people.

        "Content": "A Ukrainian skeleton racer has been banned from competing at the Winter Olympics after he insisted on wearing a helmet depicting athletes killed since Russia's invasion. Vladyslav Heraskevych, 27, told reporters he would appeal to the Court of Arbitration for Sport. \"It's hard to say or put into words. It's emptiness,\" he said in response to the ban. \"It really looks like discrimination because many athletes already were expressing themselves,\" he added. The International Olympic Committee (IOC) had pleaded with Heraskevych ‌to adhere to guidelines and avoid potential disqualification from the Games and the men's skeleton race on Thursday. It argued his \"helmet of remembrance\", depicting 24 images of dead compatriots, violated rules which prevent political statements while athletes are competing. The IOC had suggested compromises, including wearing a black armband or showing the helmet before and after racing. But the athlete, whose performance had put him within reach of a medal in Italy, remained defiant after a ​meeting between the two sides on Wednesday failed to secure an agreement. \n                  Former spy chief on Mandelson, Ukraine, China and Trump\n                 \n                  Ukraine rallies Europe to block FIFA's push to reinstate Russia and end ban from international football\n                 \n                  Russian citizen detained in Dubai over shooting of general in Moscow\n                 Later on Thursday, Heraskevych responded to the ban by thanking Ukrainians for their support while holding the helmet in a video online. Ivan Krulko, the president of the Biathlon Federation of Ukraine, also criticised the move, saying the group was \"convinced that honouring the memory of the fallen is not political propaganda, but a fundamental humanitarian and moral gesture\". He added that considering commemoration a political act was \"unacceptable\", and called on the IOC to \"reconsider its approach and find a solution that corresponds not only to the letter of the rules, but also to the spirit of Olympic values\". The International Bobsled and Skeleton Federation said Heraskevych's decision to wear the helmet was \"inconsistent with the Olympic Charter and Guidelines on Athlete Expression.\" Under the Olympic Charter - an 108-page-long document effectively serving as the Games' constitution - political neutrality is a foundational principle. Rule 50 of the charter states that \"no kind of demonstration or political, religious or racial propaganda is permitted in any Olympic sites, venues or other areas\". Additionally, Rule 40 states that athletes comply with \"conditions of participation established by the IOC,\" including where and how free expression can be displayed.\n\n  IOC president 'really wanted to see him race' President Kirsty Coventry was choked up with tears after being unable to change Heraskevych's mind on Thursday morning before the race. She said she did not disagree with his \"powerful message\". \"I really ‌wanted to see him race. It's been an emotional morning,\" Coventry said. \"It's literally about the rules and the regulations and that in this case... we have to be able to keep a safe environment for everyone and sadly, that just means no messaging is ‌allowed.\" Separately, the IOC said in a statement on Thursday that it was \"very keen for Mr Heraskevych to compete\". \"This is why the IOC sat down with him to look for the most respectful way to address his desire to remember his fellow athletes who have lost their lives following Russia's invasion of Ukraine.\" Ukraine's Olympic Committee had backed their athlete, who ⁠is also the team's flagbearer for the Games and who displayed ⁠a \"No War in Ukraine\" sign at the Beijing 2022 Olympics, days before Russia's invasion. Heraskevych said even if he wanted to change the helmet, he would not ​have time to prepare one that would fit him. Heraskevych: 'I'm not violating rules' The athlete said he believes there are inconsistencies in how the IOC decides what statements are allowed. \"I believe, deeply, the IBSF [International Bobsleigh and Skeleton Federation] and IOC understand that I'm not violating any rules,\" Heraskevych said on Thursday. He explained that US figure skater Maxim Naumov brought a photo of his late parents, who were killed in a plane crash, to a corner of the rink on Tuesday. And Israeli skeleton athlete Jared Firestone wore a skullcap at the opening ceremony with names of Israeli athletes and coaches killed in the 1972 Munich attack. But both those messages were seen outside competition, or what the IOC calls the 'field of play'.

        "Content": "\n          Climate reporter\n              @SeabrookClimate\n Donald Trump has just gone for the jugular of climate legislation. The US president has scrapped a scientific finding by the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) that greenhouse gas emissions endanger human health - the so-called \"endangerment finding\". If you want to gut federal climate action in the US, this is the big one to go for, because it is the legal basis for many other rules. Accepting that greenhouse gas emissions harm health - and scientists are clear they do, by way of air pollution, and extreme weather like heavy flooding - is what has justified subsequent rules to clean up the sources of those emissions. He has also repealed rules on emissions standards for all vehicles and engines. Transport is the biggest polluting sector in the US, famously a nation of drivers. If US transport was a country, it would be the sixth biggest polluter in the world. \n                  Social media ban: Have we reached a tipping point?\n                 \n                  Do the latest AI resignations actually mean the world is in 'peril'?\n                 \n                  'Tipping point' reached in creation of brain chips to help 'unlock' minds of people with paralysis\n                 That's bigger than the entire economies of Brazil or Indonesia. The big motivation for these changes is to cut costs. The White House stresses that these moves will save carmakers about $2,400 (£1,754) a car, and the economy $1.3trn (£954bn) a year. Environmentalists dispute these figures, saying that if cars are less fuel efficient, petrol bills will go up, and so will healthcare bills for asthma sufferers, or households cleaning up wildfire or flood damage. Read more on Sky News:Scramble to reach communities after floodsAntarctica's weird biology But the news has been welcomed by the fossil fuel industry, and Republicans who say the rules went too far by regulating emissions in a manner that side-stepped approval by Congress. Climate policies in the US always yo-yo under the Democrats and Republicans, the latter being far more sceptical. Environmentalists are now planning to challenge these rollbacks in court. But if they go through, it will make it much harder for anyone to ever bring the limits on climate pollution back in again. ."

Tom Homan, who's leading the White House's anti-immigration campaign, said the administration had agreed to end Operation Metro Surge.

Mr Trump said it had given the impression he incited violence and encouraged people to storm the building. The edited clip used soundbites from the president that were 50 minutes apart in reality - but were spliced together to say: \"We're going to walk down to the Capitol... and I'll be there with you. And we fight. We fight like hell.\" The 6 January attack on the Capitol is a day of infamy in modern US history, which a Senate report said led to loss of at least seven lives, including five police officers.

Instagram employees working on policy, communictions and well-being, including the former deputy prime minister Nick Clegg, pushed to keep the ban. \"We would - rightly - be accused of ‌putting growth over responsibility,\" said Mr Clegg, who was then Meta's vice president of global affairs, according to the emails.

He also said: \"Often people try to frame things as you either prioritise safety or you prioritise revenue. It's really hard to imagine any instance where prioritising safety isn't good for revenue.\" However, his testimony has been criticised by those working with bereaved families. \"Adam Mosseri's testimony under oath today revealed what families have long suspected: Instagram's executives made a conscious decision to put growth over the safety of minors,\" said Matthew P Bergman, founding attorney of the Social Media Victims Law Center. \"His admission goes to the heart of this trial - these harms were not accidental, but the result of deliberate design choices that prioritised engagement over children's wellbeing. \"The evidence shows that Instagram knew the risks its product posed to young users, yet continued to deploy features engineered to keep kids online longer, even when those features exposed them to significant danger.\""

Other allies were more diplomatic, playing down the no-show, though Germany's defence minister underlined the need for the alliance to become \"more European\" to remain transatlantic. The comments were made as defence ministers from the 32-nation bloc gathered at NATO headquarters on Thursday to discuss steps to increase European security one year after Mr Hegseth warned them that the United States was shifting its focus to other priorities and Europe needed to take the lead in defending itself. Sky News asked a number of ministers, as they arrived, what they thought about the secretary of war deciding not to return to NATO headquarters for this year's ministerial, instead sending Elbridge Colby, his deputy - and whether this was a signal that the United States was less interested in the security of Europe. Thorgerdur Katrin Gunnarsdottir, the foreign minister of Iceland, who is also responsible for defence, said: \"Sadly for him he is missing a good party. Of course, it is always better that the ministers attend here but I will not describe it as a bad signal.\" She said allies had already been tested earlier in the year when Donald Trump threatened to seize Greenland - even though it is part of the Kingdom of Denmark, a fellow member of NATO. Mark Rutte, the head of the alliance, defused that crisis when he spoke with the US president on the sidelines of a major economic forum in the Swiss ski resort of Davos, making clear that defending the Arctic is a core priority for all allies. \n                  Former spy chief on Mandelson, Ukraine, China and Trump\n                 \n                  Hong Kong leader celebrates Jimmy Lai's sentence - as plan to enhance security law published\n                 \n                  Relationship with United States is 'rock solid', Taiwan president insists  - despite Donald Trump's call with Xi Jinping\n                 On Wednesday, NATO announced an enhanced mission to protect the high north, called Arctic Sentry. The move appears designed to demonstrate to Mr Trump that the territory is well protected from threats from Russia and China. \"I think now the alliance is stronger than in the beginning of the year,\" the Icelandic foreign minister said. Boris Pistorius, the defence minister of Germany, which is hugely ramping up its defence spending in response to Mr Trump's demands, said he was \"not disappointed\" that his American counterpart had stayed away from the NATO meeting.

        "Content": "Blake Lively and Justin Baldoni have attended court together for the first time since their acrimonious It Ends With Us legal battle began more than a year ago. The pair co-starred in the romantic drama, which Baldoni also directed, but promoted the film separately after its release in August 2024. In December that year, Lively filed a lawsuit alleging sexual harassment and accusing the filmmaker of co-ordinating a smear campaign against her. On Wednesday, the pair and their legal teams attended the US District Court in Manhattan, New York, to see if the case could be settled without going to trial. Mandatory settlement talks are generally required as part of civil proceedings, but are not open to the public or media. Talks between the stars' lawyers went on for more than six hours before they were pictured leaving the federal courthouse separately. Baldoni's wife, Emily, also attended the hearing. His attorney Bryan Freedman said afterwards that the talks did not result in a settlement. The stars spent the majority of the day in separate courtrooms, Sky News' US partner NBC reported, citing a source familiar with the proceedings. Magistrate Judge Sarah L Cave went back and forth between both legal teams, the source said. Will the case go to trial? Freedman told reporters outside the courtroom that the teams would return to court on Thursday for a \"different matter on the docket\", but did not say whether Baldoni and Lively would be present. He did not rule out a possible settlement in the future, saying that \"there's always a chance\" and that he remains \"very hopeful\" about how the case will proceed. If no settlement is reached, a trial is due to begin in May.

It began with Lively suing Baldoni and his hired crisis communications expert, alleging harassment and a co-ordinated campaign to attack her reputation after she complained about his treatment of her on the movie set. Baldoni and his Wayfarer Studios production company countersued Lively and her husband, Deadpool actor Ryan Reynolds, accusing them of defamation and extortion. His case was dismissed by a judge in June last year. A lawyer representing Baldoni, the studio and its representatives described Lively's claims as \"completely false, outrageous and intentionally salacious\"."

        "Content": "\n          Technology correspondent\n              @rowlsmanthorpe\n When most people leave their jobs, they send out an email to their colleagues, arrange some drinks at a nearby pub, and that's about it. The situation in artificial intelligence could not be more different. The level of scrutiny on the field means that researchers who leave their jobs can, if they choose, do so with great fanfare. Even if they leave quietly, the mere fact of their movement is often taken as some kind of signal. Several such resignations have drawn attention this week. On Tuesday, Mrinank Sharma, a researcher at leading AI company Anthropic, posted a resignation statement to social media in which he warned that \"the world is in peril\". Although Sharma did not exactly say why the world was imperilled, noting instead that the threat came \"not just from AI, or bioweapons, but from a whole series of interconnected crises unfolding in this very moment\", many took this to mean that the existential risk from AI was increasing. On Wednesday, Zoe Hitzig, a researcher with OpenAI, announced her resignation with an essay in the New York Times, citing \"deep reservations\" about OpenAI's plans to add advertising to ChatGPT. \"ChatGPT users have generated an archive of human candour that has no precedent,\" Hitzig wrote, warning that ChatGPT had the potential to manipulate people if their data was not properly protected. Meanwhile, two of the co-founders of xAI also quit this week, along with a number of other staff at Elon Musk's AI company. xAI makes the Grok chatbot, which provoked a global backlash after it was allowed to generate nonconsensual sexualised images of women and children on X for several weeks before anyone intervened to stop it. X has since said it has made major changes to its AI chatbot Grok. Put together, these departures were taken by many to signal that - in the words of an essay about AI which gained traction this week - \"something big is happening\". Media reports and social media posts described the resignations as a \"wave\". On closer inspection, however, the moves have little in common. Sharma was resigning for vague reasons to do with \"values\" in order to write poetry. Hitzig - who is also a poet - has deep concerns about advertisements and user data. The employees who left xAI did not go into detail about their reasons for leaving, although the recent changes at the company, which is due to merge with Musk's space firm SpaceX, may have played a role. The concerns raised by Hitzig and Sharma are widely shared, not least by Nobel Prize-winning scientist Geoffrey Hinton, known as the \"Godfather of AI\", who left his role at Google in order to warn that AI poses an existential risk to humanity. Perhaps the other reason these statements have attracted so much attention now is that they tap into fears about the rapid growth of AI, which has made stunning strides in recent months, especially in software development. Microsoft AI CEO Mustafa Suleyman told the Financial Times on Wednesday he believed that most tasks performed by white-collar workers, such as lawyers and accountants, would be fully automated in 12 to 18 months, describing the progress in recent years as \"eye-watering.\" Many senior figures in AI have made similar warnings. Read more from Sky News:Should we be worried about brain chips?This AI just passed the 'vending machine test' Whatever the motivations, the feverish atmosphere around AI could be contributing to the exits, according to Dr Henry Shevlin, Associate Director at Leverhulme Centre for the Future of Intelligence at the University of Cambridge. \"Walkouts from AI companies are nothing new,\" Dr Shevlin told Sky News. \"But why are we seeing a wave right now? Part of it is illusory - as AI has become a bigger deal, AI walkouts have become more newsworthy, so we observe more clusters. \"However, it's fair to say that as AI becomes more powerful and more widely used, we're facing more questions about its appropriate scope, use, and impact. \"That is generating heated debates both in society at large and within companies and may be contributing to a higher rate of concerned employees deciding to head for the exit.\" Anthropic declined to comment, pointing only to a tweet from a member of staff thanking Sharma for his work. OpenAI did not respond to a request for comment."

The two actors rose to fame on the hit teen drama, which launched in 1998, playing on-off boyfriend and girlfriend Dawson Leery and Joey Potter. Van Der Beek died on Wednesday, aged 48, after being diagnosed with bowel cancer in 2023. Holmes, 47, said the news of his death had been \"a lot to process\" but she was \"grateful to have shared in a piece of his journey\". In a handwritten tribute shared in a photo on Instagram, she said they had shared \"laughter\", \"conversations about life\", and \"adventures of a unique youth\". Holmes, who went on to star in films and shows including Batman Begins and Ray Donovan, continued: \"Bravery. Compassion. Selflessness. Strength. An appreciation for life and the action taken to live life with the integrity that life is art - creating a beautiful marriage, six loving children - the journey of a hero.\" The actress included a message to Van Der Beek's wife, Kimberly, and his children, saying: \"We are here for you always. And will always be there to shower you with love and compassion.\" Dawson's Creek, which ran from 1998 to 2003, followed a group of high school friends and the highs and lows of their friendships and romances. 'One in a billion' Alongside Van Der Beek and Holmes, Michelle Williams and Joshua Jackson made up the core cast of four, playing Jen Lindley and Pacey Witter, respectively. The show was hugely popular, turning the young actors into household names in the US and UK. Busy Philipps, who starred in a later series of the show, also paid tribute to Van Der Beek, describing him as \"one in a billion\" and saying: \"My heart is deeply hurting for all of us today.\" She also shared details of a GoFundMe page set up to support the actor's family, which says his medical care \"and the extended fight against cancer have left the family out of funds\". More than $1m has already been donated. Mary-Margaret Humes, who played Dawson's mother Gail, shared pictures of the pair together and wrote: \"Rarely am I at a loss for words … today would be the exception. James, my gracious warrior, you fought a hard battle against all odds with such quiet strength and dignity. I will always love and admire you for that.\" She said they had spoken just a few days before his death and that those conversations are \"forever sitting softly in my heart for safe keeping\".

        "Content": "Survivors of Jeffrey Epstein have accused the US attorney general of lacking empathy and humanity following her combative appearance in front of a Congress committee. Pam Bondi gave her first sworn testimony since the release of the Epstein files on Wednesday, which at times descended into a shouting match. Ms Bondi is ultimately in charge of the files' release as head of the Department of Justice (DoJ). Critics claim some powerful figures are still being protected, as not all documents have been released, and many have been heavily redacted. Ms Bondi defended the way the process had been handled and said she was \"deeply sorry for what any victim has been through, especially as a result of that monster\". However, she refused to take personal responsibility for initial failures to hide the names of some victims and said staff had done their best under pressure. Ms Bondi also refused to face a group of survivors in the room, accusing the Democrats of resorting to \"theatrics\" and saying they were using the scandal to distract from US President Donald Trump's successes. \"You sit here and you attack the president and I'm not going to have it. I am not going to put up with it,\" Ms Bondi told the committee. The group gathered behind Ms Bondi all raised their hands when Democrat member Pramila Jayapal asked which survivors still had not been able to meet DoJ officials. The attorney general also revealed her department had pending investigations against some Epstein co-conspirators - something many victims are pushing for - but did not elaborate on who that involved. Epstein survivors later hit out at Ms Bondi's appearance, with one saying she felt \"degraded\" by her testimony. \"There was such a lack of empathy today. There was such a lack of, honestly, humanity today,\" Dani Bensky told Sky's US partner NBC News. \"Something that I think all of us felt a little devastated about was that she had three opportunities to address survivors,\" she added. \"We stood up, and all she had to do was turn around, and she could not even turn around and face us.\" Ms Bensky said she was abused by Epstein in his New York mansion when she was a 17-year-old aspiring ballerina. Teresa Helm, who said Epstein abused her when she was 22, also felt let down by Ms Bondi: \"There was no integrity in that room today, it seems like, when it came to Epstein and (Ghislaine) Maxwell,\" she said. Sharlene Rochard, who met Epstein as a teenage model, told NBC she felt \"really degraded\" and Ms Bondi was \"not taking at all any accountability\" regarding survivors.

Valeria Chomsky said the couple had never witnessed any inappropriate behaviour by the disgraced financier, who killed himself in 2019. \"Noam and I recognise the gravity of Jeffrey Epstein's crimes and the profound suffering of his victims,\" Valeria Chomsky said in a statement. The friendship between Chomsky, 97, and Epstein had been known about but the latest files appear to reveal deeper ties than previously thought. \"When we were introduced to Epstein, he presented himself as a philanthropist supporting science and a financial expert,\" said Mrs Chomsky. \"By presenting himself this way, Epstein gained Noam's attention, and they began corresponding. Unknowingly, we opened a door to a Trojan horse.\""

        "Content": "\n          City editor\n              @MarkKleinmanSky\n NatWest Group will disclose on Friday that it awarded bonuses of nearly £500m last year, as it returned to full private ownership 17 years after it was rescued by taxpayers. Sky News has learnt that the high street lender will say alongside its annual results that its bonus pool for 2025 was just over £490m, an increase of about 10% on the previous year's figure. Money latest: Chain crowned nation's favourite supermarket for fifth time The rise will be broadly in line with the hikes awarded by rival UK banks such as Barclays and Lloyds Banking Group, and comes as NatWest's shares trade at levels rarely seen in close to two decades. Earlier this week, NatWest confirmed that it was buying Evelyn Partners, the wealth manager, for £2.7bn, its biggest corporate acquisition since Royal Bank of Scotland, as it was known then, was bailed out with a £45.5bn equity injection in 2008. The lender, which at one point was more than 80% state-owned, returned to full private sector ownership last May, ending a tumultuous period in its history. In the years immediately following its bailout, RBS's bonus decisions were intensely scrutinised in Westminster, prompting heated discussions between the bank's management and its government shareholder. \n                  More Lloyds, Halifax and Bank of Scotland branches to close – check if yours is affected\n                 \n                  Contactless card £100 limit to rise\n                 \n                  Nationwide fined £44m for financial crime failures\n                 For more information about how we use your data and your rights, you can visit our Privacy Centre. Those tensions have been defused in recent years by the gradual return to majority private ownership and broadly shrinking overall bonus numbers. The 2025 bonus pot of close to £500m will reflect its improved financial trajectory during the year, with performance targets having been upgraded as recently as October. Unlike Barclays and HSBC, NatWest no longer operates a sizeable investment bank, meaning its annual bonus pools are significantly smaller than those of rivals. Lloyds, which handed out bonuses of about £400m last year, is also expected to publish its annual report on Friday, setting out details of a revamped remuneration policy. NatWest and Lloyds both declined to comment."

He also said: \"Often people try to frame things as you either prioritise safety or you prioritise revenue. It's really hard to imagine any instance where prioritising safety isn't good for revenue.\" However, his testimony has been criticised by those working with bereaved families. \"Adam Mosseri's testimony under oath today revealed what families have long suspected: Instagram's executives made a conscious decision to put growth over the safety of minors,\" said Matthew P Bergman, founding attorney of the Social Media Victims Law Center. \"His admission goes to the heart of this trial - these harms were not accidental, but the result of deliberate design choices that prioritised engagement over children's wellbeing. \"The evidence shows that Instagram knew the risks its product posed to young users, yet continued to deploy features engineered to keep kids online longer, even when those features exposed them to significant danger.\""

        "Headline": "Sky News looks at the business history of Sir Jim Ratcliffe, his involvement with Manchester United, and his previous remarks about politics.",
        "Content": "By George Nash, news reporter  Sir Jim Ratcliffe, the co-owner of Manchester United and one of the UK's richest men, has sparked controversy over comments he made about immigration in an interview with Sky News.  Speaking to economics and data editor Ed Conway, Sir Jim said Britain had been \"colonised by immigrants\" who are draining resources from the state. Sir Jim's comments have drawn criticism from the prime minister, who called them \"offensive and wrong\", as well as from a number of anti-racism groups, with Kick It Out, football's anti-discrimination body, labelling the remarks as \"disgraceful and deeply divisive\". But who is the billionaire behind the controversial comments? What does he do for work? Sir Jim, a former chemical engineer, is the founder, chairman and majority owner of the INEOS petrochemicals group, which he started in May 1998. Today, the company operates 154 sites in 27 countries, generating more than £40bn annually and employing over 24,500 people worldwide. As well as football, INEOS is also involved in several other sports, including Formula 1, cycling and sailing. How much is he worth? According to the 2025 Sunday Times Rich List, Sir Jim's net worth is estimated at £17.05bn, a decline of £6.5bn from the previous year. The 73-year-old is currently Britain's seventh-richest man, but his wealth has fluctuated in recent years. He topped the UK-only list in 2018, when his personal wealth was estimated at £21.05bn. When did he become Manchester United co-owner? A lifelong United fan, Sir Jim became a minority owner of the club in February 2024, spending over £1bn to acquire a 25% stake and assume control over football operations. He had previously tabled a bid to buy Chelsea for £4.25bn in 2022, but lost out to a consortium led by American businessman Todd Boehly. Since buying a minority stake at Old Trafford, Sir Jim has overseen major cost-saving measures at the club, including the cutting of hundreds of jobs and stopping the policy of free meals for club staff. Read more:Why Ratcliffe's remarks may not go down well at Utd Has he helped improve the club's fortunes? United announced record revenues of £666.5m for the 2024/25 season - an increase of 0.7% - but still made an overall loss of £33m. The club posted record commercial revenues of £333.3m, and achieved record match day revenues of £160.3m. Last year, the 20-time English champions unveiled plans for a new 100,000-seater stadium which would exceed Wembley Stadium as the biggest in the country. The project is estimated to cost £2bn and could bring billions of pounds to the UK economy, create as many as 92,000 jobs and more than 17,000 new homes, according to the club. However, United's on-field fortunes have been far less encouraging. Their 15th-placed finish in the Premier League last season was their lowest in the top-flight for more than half a century. Meanwhile, Ruben Amorim, the first permanent managerial appointment made by the club during Sir Jim's tenure, was sacked last month after just 14 months in charge. Results, however, have improved under interim head coach Michael Carrick, with the club battling for a top-five finish having beaten rivals Manchester City and Arsenal recently. What has Sir Jim previously said about immigration? Sir Jim was a prominent backer of the UK's withdrawal from the EU in 2016, but has since become a resident of tax-free Monaco. He threw his weight behind Sir Keir Starmer before the 2024 general election, but has since suggested he may be \"too nice\" for the job and has expressed admiration for Nigel Farage. He has previously expressed his opinion on immigration, telling Sky News in May 2024 that it was \"the biggest component\" of the Brexit vote. \"A small island like the UK can't cope with vast numbers of people coming in,\" he said. \"It just overburdens the National Health Service, the traffic service, the police, everybody. \"The country was designed for 55 or 60 million people, and we've got 70 million people and all the services break down as a consequence.\" In his latest interview with Ed Conway, he claimed immigration had pushed the country's population from 58 million in 2020 to 70 million in 2026. The Office for National Statistics estimates the population of the UK was 67 million in mid-2020 and 70 million in mid-2024. It was estimated at 58.9 million in 2000."

        "Content": "A holiday tax in England would put an extra £100 or more on the cost of a fortnight's stay, according to industry bosses. A letter, coordinated by the trade body UKHospitality, has warned the chancellor that her plans would hit families hard, put jobs at risk and drain money from local communities. In the autumn budget, Rachel Reeves confirmed that English regional mayors will have the powers to introduce visitor levies on overnight stays in hotels, Airbnbs and holiday lets. Read all the latest Money news here The aim is to give local mayors more funds to invest in local infrastructure and transport and mirror similar moves in Scotland and Wales. But around 200 organisations, representing bosses of leading UK accommodation firms - including Butlin's, Hilton and Travelodge - said in the letter that \"holidays are for relaxing, not taxing\". The letter read: \"This 'Holiday Tax' will hit families hardest, puts jobs at risk, drain money from local businesses and communities and undermine the Government's growth agenda. \n                  UK's top 100 taxpayers revealed - and who has contributed the most to a record £5.7bn?\n                 \n                  Cabinet revolt brewing over business rates hike - as hospitality warned not to protest\n                 \n                  Budget 2025: What is a freeze on income tax thresholds - and will you pay more?\n                 \"For millions of hardworking families, a UK holiday is their chance to switch off and spend quality time together. \"For many, this tax will make their holiday unaffordable, meaning families will shorten trips, forgo a break altogether, reduce their spending with pubs, restaurants, events, leisure activities and local attractions, or travel overseas - spending their money and creating jobs elsewhere.\" Explainer: How much could a tourist tax in England raise? UKHospitality estimated a levy of £2 per person, per night, would mean a family of four paying £112 more for a fortnight's break. If the levy is based on a 5% charge, instead of a flat-rate, then the cost would be £100 for a family of four spending £2,000 on a 14-night break. Visitors taxed in Scotland and Wales This is in line with Edinburgh and Glasgow's 5% visitor levy, which come into force in July 2026 and January 2027 respectively, while Aberdeen is to charge 7% from April 2027. Meanwhile, Wales is allowing authorities to introduce a tax of up to £1.30 per person, per night from next April. There are no plans to introduce fees for visitors in Northern Ireland. Manchester and Liverpool also operate levies, collected via accommodation providers, which are not technically tourist taxes but function in a similar way. Read more from Sky News:Worse-than-expected economic statsInterest rate cuts 'likely' later this year The letter described the burden of rising energy costs, employment costs and business rates, which are due to rise in the coming months, although pubs have been given extra support. It also said VAT is \"double the rate of competitors in France, Italy, Spain or Portugal\". A government spokesman said: \"We're giving our mayors powers to harness this and put more money into local priorities, so they can keep driving growth and investment in the economy, supporting thriving communities. \"We expect any new charges to be modest and in line with other countries, and it is for mayors to consider the right level for their area.\""

Sky News understands that The Compression Company will on Friday announce a $3.4m (£2.5m) fundraising led by Long Journey, which has backed some of the world's biggest technology businesses, including SpaceX, Uber and Anduril. The Compression Company uses AI-driven compression which runs onboard satellites in order to reduce file sizes by more than 95%, which it says unlocks one of the principal bottlenecks in the delivery of useful data back to Earth.

In a statement, the Cabinet Office said the prime minister and the cabinet secretary have agreed Sir Chris will stand down \"by mutual agreement\" from today. He replaced Simon Case in the £200,000-a-year role on 16 December 2024. His departure on Thursday makes him the shortest-serving cabinet secretary in history. The role will now be shared by three senior civil servants until a replacement is appointed, and it leaves Sir Keir Starmer without a permanent cabinet secretary, chief of staff, or director of communications - roles that have all been vacated in less than a week. Politics latest: No 'thank you' for Starmer in Wormald's departure note Sir Chris said: \"It has been an honour and a privilege to serve as a civil servant for the past 35 years, and a particular distinction to lead the service as cabinet secretary. \"I want to place on record my sincere thanks to the extraordinary civil servants, public servants, ministers, and advisers I have worked with.

I wish him the very best for the future.\" Third No 10 departure in less than a week The cabinet secretary is the head of the Civil Service, and is often a key adviser to the prime minister on major policy decisions and the internal workings of the government. At the time of his appointment 14 months ago, Sir Keir said Sir Chris would be tasked with \"the complete re-wiring of the British state to deliver bold and ambitious long-term reform\", and there was \"no one better placed\" to deliver that than him. However, there have been reports for months that the prime minister was unhappy with his performance, and his departure comes as little surprise to many in Whitehall, and comes on the heels of Morgan McSweeney leaving as Downing Street chief of staff and Tim Allan as communications director following the crisis of Sir Keir's premiership in the last week. Reacting to Sir Chris's ousting, Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch said he is \"the latest person Keir Starmer has thrown under the bus to save his own skin\". And Dave Penman, the leader of the FDA union that represents civil servants, called the treatment of Sir Chris a \"new low for this government and its relationship with the civil service\". He highlighted that briefing against Wormald began shortly after he took office and were started to \"scapegoat him and undermine his authority\". The responsibilities of the job will be shared in the interim between three senior civil servants - Catherine Little, permanent secretary at the Cabinet Office, James Bowler, permanent secretary at the Treasury, and Dame Antonia Romeo, permanent secretary at the Home Office, and widely reported to be the prime minister's preferred candidate to take on the role permanently. An appointment is expected to be made \"shortly\", the Cabinet Office said."

        "Content": "\n          Security and Defence Editor\n              @haynesdeborah\n The UK and its European allies are scrambling to get serious about their own defences as Donald Trump, Xi Jinping and Vladimir Putin shape a new world order. You can expect to hear multiple declarations from European leaders, including Sir Keir Starmer, about their respective plans to ramp up spending on defence and security at a major security conference in Munich over the next three days. But the key indicator to track is evidence of the rhetoric becoming cold, hard fighting reality. It is certainly what the United States will be looking for - a form of scrutiny that became clear at a separate meeting of defence ministers from the NATO alliance in Brussels on Thursday. Elbridge Colby, the US under secretary of war policy - a deputy to Pete Hegseth who chose to miss the gathering in what some insiders saw as a signal of the US reducing the priority it places on its NATO membership, though others denied this was the case - delivered a striking speech to allies. He said Europe must take the lead in defending itself, but - in words that will come as some relief to his counterparts - stressed that the US was not abandoning NATO. \"The world that shaped the habits, assumptions, and force posture of NATO during the so-called 'unipolar moment' following the Cold War no longer exists,\" Mr Colby said. \n                  Veterans can be recalled for service until they are 65 under new measures\n                 \n                  PM says UK needs to be ready for war - but there is little sign of meaningful action behind the scenes\n                 \n                  UK has no plan for defending nation in event of war, military chief reveals\n                 \"Power politics has returned, and military force is again being employed at a large scale.\" The Trump administration official said his message was about giving a reality check to his partners, about the need to turn a pledge made at a major NATO summit last year to increase total defence and security spending to 5% of GDP into viable military capability. \"For Europe, it means moving beyond inputs and intentions toward outputs and capabilities,\" Mr Colby said. \"Defence spending levels matter, and there is no substitute for it. But what matters at the end of the day is what those resources produce: ready forces, usable munitions, resilient logistics, and integrated command structures that work at scale under stress. \"It means prioritising war-fighting effectiveness over bureaucratic and regulatory stasis. It means making hard choices about force structure, readiness, stockpiles, and industrial capacity that reflect the realities of modern conflict rather than peacetime politics.\" These words should be triggering alarm bells in London and other - in particular Western - European capitals that have for too long relied on spin over substance when it comes to talking about defence. The spending pledge last year comprises a commitment to increase spending on core defence to 3.5% of GDP by 2035, up from a target of 2%, with an additional 1.5% of GDP to be spent on an ill-defined bucket of wider security measures. Donald Trump applauded the move, which he rightly received credit for forcing through. However, the US president talks as though those levels of defence spending have already been met. In reality, many allies are planning to take advantage of the full ten-year timespan to reach the target - including the UK, even though it is a leading member of the alliance and a key partner of the United States. Mr Starmer's government is only planning to inch up core defence spending to 2.5% of GDP by next year, lift it to 3% by the next parliament, and only reach the full 5% by 2035. Defence sources say this is far too slow given the scale of the challenge to rebuild the UK's armed forces as well as wider national resilience. It is also, as Mr Colby said, not just about how much money a country spends but what the cash is spent on and whether input translates to credible military output. Again, on that point, the UK is seen to be falling short. Read more from Sky News:Parents speak as ex-nursery worker jailed for sex abuseDo latest AI resignations mean the world is in 'peril'? A plan for defence investment - due to be published last year - is yet to be revealed amid reports of a £28bn hole in the budget over the next four years. At a press conference following the NATO conference, I asked John Healey, the defence secretary, if the UK was failing to meet the moment. He strongly pushed back on this suggestion. \"The UK has always met its commitments to funding NATO,\" he said. \"The UK is putting more money into defence this year than it has done for 15 years - £270bn in this parliament alone. This is the largest increase since the end of the Cold War.\" But given that defence spending across NATO was repeatedly cut following the collapse of the Soviet Union, this is perhaps not the best measure to judge whether what is being spent now is actually enough. And many believe that it is not."

        "Content": "\n          Security and Defence Editor\n              @haynesdeborah\n Europe must take the lead in defending itself as the world becomes more militarised, but the US is not abandoning its NATO allies, a top American official has said. Elbridge Colby, the US Under Secretary of War, said the alliance must be prepared for potential enemies to strike simultaneously in different parts of the globe. This was why European members of NATO must take the \"primary responsibility\" when it comes to defending their homeland - as US forces are focused elsewhere. Ultimately, he said the alliance needs to become a modern version of its original Cold War status - defined by hard and credible fighting strength. Mr Colby, who was representing Secretary of War Pete Hegseth, made the comments at a meeting of NATO defence ministers in Brussels on Thursday. Allies have tried to play down his boss's absence as not signalling a reduction in US prioritisation of NATO. \"The world that shaped the habits, assumptions, and force posture of NATO during the so-called 'unipolar moment' following the Cold War no longer exists,\" Mr Colby said, according to a transcript of his remarks that were published by his department. \n                  Trial date set for Trump's $10bn lawsuit against BBC over Panorama edit\n                 \n                  Donald Trump agrees to end ICE operation in Minnesota\n                 \n                  Call to make NATO 'more European' - as key figure misses alliance summit\n                 \"Power politics has returned, and military force is again being employed at a large scale,\" he added. This meant that the United States, under Donald Trump, was prioritising the biggest threats to US interests - especially the defence of the US homeland and its interests in the Western Hemisphere. \"At the same time - and critically - the United States and its allies must be prepared for the possibility that potential opponents will act simultaneously across multiple theatres, whether in a coordinated fashion or opportunistically.\" Mark Rutte, the head of NATO, has previously raised the possibility of China making a move on Taiwan, which may draw in US forces, at the same time as Russia seeks to test NATO's Article 5 principle of collective defence by attacking a European member of the alliance. This could leave the Europeans and Canada to tackle Russian aggression alone or with only limited US support. Mr Elbridge said his message was about giving a reality check to his partners, not the US turning its back on NATO - something that allies have fretted about ever since Mr Trump returned to the White House. \"This is not an abandonment of NATO. To the contrary, it is a return to and validation of its foundational purpose,\" the official said. He recalled how the alliance, when it was established in 1949, was defined by \"a hard-nosed, realistic, clear-eyed approach to deterrence and defence. Allies from the beginning were expected to pull their weight\". This discipline was lost after the Cold War ended as priorities shifted to fighting wars in Afghanistan and Iraq - outside NATO territory. Mr Elbridge said the alliance must now become what he called NATO 3.0 - which was more akin to its original purpose. \"This 'NATO 3.0' requires much greater efforts by our allies to step up and assume primary responsibility for the conventional defence of Europe,\" he said. Read more on Sky News:NATO should 'be more European'New threat of Putin's hypersonic missileUK 'must step up' to deter Russian threat The Under Secretary of War praised allies for heeding Mr Trump's calls to commit to increase defence and wider security spending to 5% of GDP - up from an original goal for defence spending of 2%. But he said European leadership on defence must be durable. \"Europe must assume primary responsibility for its own conventional defence. This is not a matter of ideology or rhetorical flourish. It is a conclusion grounded in a clear-eyed and rigorous assessment of the strategic environment we face as well as a pragmatic evaluation of the capabilities at our disposal. \"At the same time, the United States must - and will - prioritise those theatres and challenges where only American power can play a decisive role.\" He said the move was \"not a retreat from Europe. It is, rather, an affirmation of strategic pragmatism and a recognition of our allies' undeniable ability to step up and lead on Europe's defence in a way that leaves all of us stronger and safer\"."

        "Content": "\n          Climate reporter\n              @SeabrookClimate\n Donald Trump has just gone for the jugular of climate legislation. The US president has scrapped a scientific finding by the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) that greenhouse gas emissions endanger human health - the so-called \"endangerment finding\". If you want to gut federal climate action in the US, this is the big one to go for, because it is the legal basis for many other rules. Accepting that greenhouse gas emissions harm health - and scientists are clear they do, by way of air pollution, and extreme weather like heavy flooding - is what has justified subsequent rules to clean up the sources of those emissions. He has also repealed rules on emissions standards for all vehicles and engines. Transport is the biggest polluting sector in the US, famously a nation of drivers. If US transport was a country, it would be the sixth biggest polluter in the world. \n                  Social media ban: Have we reached a tipping point?\n                 \n                  Do the latest AI resignations actually mean the world is in 'peril'?\n                 \n                  'Tipping point' reached in creation of brain chips to help 'unlock' minds of people with paralysis\n                 That's bigger than the entire economies of Brazil or Indonesia. The big motivation for these changes is to cut costs. The White House stresses that these moves will save carmakers about $2,400 (£1,754) a car, and the economy $1.3trn (£954bn) a year. Environmentalists dispute these figures, saying that if cars are less fuel efficient, petrol bills will go up, and so will healthcare bills for asthma sufferers, or households cleaning up wildfire or flood damage.

Climate policies in the US always yo-yo under the Democrats and Republicans, the latter being far more sceptical. Environmentalists are now planning to challenge these rollbacks in court. But if they go through, it will make it much harder for anyone to ever bring the limits on climate pollution back in again. ."

        "Content": "\n          Technology correspondent\n              @rowlsmanthorpe\n When most people leave their jobs, they send out an email to their colleagues, arrange some drinks at a nearby pub, and that's about it. The situation in artificial intelligence could not be more different. The level of scrutiny on the field means that researchers who leave their jobs can, if they choose, do so with great fanfare. Even if they leave quietly, the mere fact of their movement is often taken as some kind of signal. Several such resignations have drawn attention this week. On Tuesday, Mrinank Sharma, a researcher at leading AI company Anthropic, posted a resignation statement to social media in which he warned that \"the world is in peril\". Although Sharma did not exactly say why the world was imperilled, noting instead that the threat came \"not just from AI, or bioweapons, but from a whole series of interconnected crises unfolding in this very moment\", many took this to mean that the existential risk from AI was increasing. On Wednesday, Zoe Hitzig, a researcher with OpenAI, announced her resignation with an essay in the New York Times, citing \"deep reservations\" about OpenAI's plans to add advertising to ChatGPT. \"ChatGPT users have generated an archive of human candour that has no precedent,\" Hitzig wrote, warning that ChatGPT had the potential to manipulate people if their data was not properly protected. Meanwhile, two of the co-founders of xAI also quit this week, along with a number of other staff at Elon Musk's AI company. xAI makes the Grok chatbot, which provoked a global backlash after it was allowed to generate nonconsensual sexualised images of women and children on X for several weeks before anyone intervened to stop it. X has since said it has made major changes to its AI chatbot Grok. Put together, these departures were taken by many to signal that - in the words of an essay about AI which gained traction this week - \"something big is happening\". Media reports and social media posts described the resignations as a \"wave\". On closer inspection, however, the moves have little in common. Sharma was resigning for vague reasons to do with \"values\" in order to write poetry. Hitzig - who is also a poet - has deep concerns about advertisements and user data. The employees who left xAI did not go into detail about their reasons for leaving, although the recent changes at the company, which is due to merge with Musk's space firm SpaceX, may have played a role. The concerns raised by Hitzig and Sharma are widely shared, not least by Nobel Prize-winning scientist Geoffrey Hinton, known as the \"Godfather of AI\", who left his role at Google in order to warn that AI poses an existential risk to humanity. Perhaps the other reason these statements have attracted so much attention now is that they tap into fears about the rapid growth of AI, which has made stunning strides in recent months, especially in software development. Microsoft AI CEO Mustafa Suleyman told the Financial Times on Wednesday he believed that most tasks performed by white-collar workers, such as lawyers and accountants, would be fully automated in 12 to 18 months, describing the progress in recent years as \"eye-watering.\" Many senior figures in AI have made similar warnings. Read more from Sky News:Should we be worried about brain chips?This AI just passed the 'vending machine test' Whatever the motivations, the feverish atmosphere around AI could be contributing to the exits, according to Dr Henry Shevlin, Associate Director at Leverhulme Centre for the Future of Intelligence at the University of Cambridge. \"Walkouts from AI companies are nothing new,\" Dr Shevlin told Sky News. \"But why are we seeing a wave right now? Part of it is illusory - as AI has become a bigger deal, AI walkouts have become more newsworthy, so we observe more clusters. \"However, it's fair to say that as AI becomes more powerful and more widely used, we're facing more questions about its appropriate scope, use, and impact. \"That is generating heated debates both in society at large and within companies and may be contributing to a higher rate of concerned employees deciding to head for the exit.\" Anthropic declined to comment, pointing only to a tweet from a member of staff thanking Sharma for his work. OpenAI did not respond to a request for comment."

He said he and his colleagues use the term \"problematic use\" to refer to \"someone spending more time on Instagram than they feel good about, and that definitely happens\". When asked about the plaintiff, a 20-year-old woman known as KGM, spending 16 hours in one day on Instagram, he told the court: \"That sounds like problematic use.\" He noted several times that he is not a medical professional. \n                  Parents of Scottish sextortion victim who took his own life sue Instagram owner Meta\n                 \n                  There's one big problem with Australia's social media ban\n                 \n                  Female stars may leave sport unless tech giants clamp down on online abuse, Ofcom warns\n                 Mr Mosseri was also quizzed on body image filters that give users the appearance of having plastic surgery. Meta - the parent company of Instagram and Facebook - banned those filters in 2019, but emails shown in court suggest Mr Mosseri and others at Instagram discussed whether to lift the ban. Instagram employees working on policy, communictions and well-being, including the former deputy prime minister Nick Clegg, pushed to keep the ban. \"We would - rightly - be accused of ‌putting growth over responsibility,\" said Mr Clegg, who was then Meta's vice president of global affairs, according to the emails. Read more from Sky News:Should we be worried about brain chips?This AI just passed the 'vending machine test' Mr Mosseri and Facebook creator Mark Zuckerberg wanted to reverse the ban but remove the filters from the app's recommendation section. This was noted in the emails as presenting a \"notable wellbeing risk\" but having less of an impact on user growth than the all-out ban. \"I was trying to balance all the different considerations,\" said Mr Mosseri ⁠in court, adding that he agreed with the ultimate decision to prohibit filters that ​promote plastic surgery. He also said: \"Often people try to frame things as you either prioritise safety or you prioritise revenue. It's really hard to imagine any instance where prioritising safety isn't good for revenue.\" However, his testimony has been criticised by those working with bereaved families. \"Adam Mosseri's testimony under oath today revealed what families have long suspected: Instagram's executives made a conscious decision to put growth over the safety of minors,\" said Matthew P Bergman, founding attorney of the Social Media Victims Law Center. \"His admission goes to the heart of this trial - these harms were not accidental, but the result of deliberate design choices that prioritised engagement over children's wellbeing. \"The evidence shows that Instagram knew the risks its product posed to young users, yet continued to deploy features engineered to keep kids online longer, even when those features exposed them to significant danger.\""

The pair co-starred in the romantic drama, which Baldoni also directed, but promoted the film separately after its release in August 2024. In December that year, Lively filed a lawsuit alleging sexual harassment and accusing the filmmaker of co-ordinating a smear campaign against her. On Wednesday, the pair and their legal teams attended the US District Court in Manhattan, New York, to see if the case could be settled without going to trial. Mandatory settlement talks are generally required as part of civil proceedings, but are not open to the public or media. Talks between the stars' lawyers went on for more than six hours before they were pictured leaving the federal courthouse separately. Baldoni's wife, Emily, also attended the hearing. His attorney Bryan Freedman said afterwards that the talks did not result in a settlement. The stars spent the majority of the day in separate courtrooms, Sky News' US partner NBC reported, citing a source familiar with the proceedings. Magistrate Judge Sarah L Cave went back and forth between both legal teams, the source said. Will the case go to trial? Freedman told reporters outside the courtroom that the teams would return to court on Thursday for a \"different matter on the docket\", but did not say whether Baldoni and Lively would be present. He did not rule out a possible settlement in the future, saying that \"there's always a chance\" and that he remains \"very hopeful\" about how the case will proceed.

Baldoni and his Wayfarer Studios production company countersued Lively and her husband, Deadpool actor Ryan Reynolds, accusing them of defamation and extortion. His case was dismissed by a judge in June last year. A lawyer representing Baldoni, the studio and its representatives described Lively's claims as \"completely false, outrageous and intentionally salacious\"."

The two actors rose to fame on the hit teen drama, which launched in 1998, playing on-off boyfriend and girlfriend Dawson Leery and Joey Potter. Van Der Beek died on Wednesday, aged 48, after being diagnosed with bowel cancer in 2023. Holmes, 47, said the news of his death had been \"a lot to process\" but she was \"grateful to have shared in a piece of his journey\". In a handwritten tribute shared in a photo on Instagram, she said they had shared \"laughter\", \"conversations about life\", and \"adventures of a unique youth\". Holmes, who went on to star in films and shows including Batman Begins and Ray Donovan, continued: \"Bravery. Compassion. Selflessness. Strength. An appreciation for life and the action taken to live life with the integrity that life is art - creating a beautiful marriage, six loving children - the journey of a hero.\" The actress included a message to Van Der Beek's wife, Kimberly, and his children, saying: \"We are here for you always.
