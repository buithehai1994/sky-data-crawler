        "Content": "By Alex Crawford, special correspondent reporting from inside the besieged Syrian city of Sweida   Warning: This article contains details that some people may find disturbing. We found the streets of Sweida city strewn with mutilated, burned and decomposing bodies as government security forces struggled to enforce the first day of a US-brokered ceasefire. Large sections of the city seemed to be on fire as we entered the besieged, mainly Druze, city. There were multiple buildings, homes, flats, shops and businesses ravaged by flames. We saw marauding groups of Arab tribal fighters breaking into homes and setting them alight. Others were spotted loading up vehicles with all sorts of goods. One vehicle had a gaggle of geese on board. Others were stocked up with shrubbery. Yet more had mattresses, cupboards and fridges. The new president sent his security forces down to the southern city to try to prevent yet more Arab tribal fighters from entering. But early on in the day, we spotted large convoys of armed men pushing their way through the few checkpoints. We did not see any government forces inside the centre while we were there, and they seemed to keep mainly to the outskirts. Inside the centre, there were continuing fierce battles for most of the day, between Druze militia led by cleric Hikmat al Hajiri and the Arab fighters supporting their Bedouin brethren. One Druze woman was shot by a sniper whilst she stood on her balcony. Her face was covered in blood, but somehow she survived despite a bullet going straight through one side of her jaw and out the other. She had also been hit on her shoulder and one arm. She was brought to a field hospital outside the city for treatment by Bedouin fighters. She said she had no idea which of the battling factions was responsible for shooting her. Two humanitarian corridors are being created to allow the estimated 30,000 trapped civilians to exit. A fleet of coaches with White Helmets flags flying has been sent to the perimeter of the city to prepare for civilians to come out.

His words of reassurance and inclusivity for all ethnic groups in Syria are failing to persuade some of the minority Druze and Arab Bedouin groups to lay down their arms. How the sectarian clashes are resolved is likely to determine how successful his presidency is, and tens of thousands of lives are dependent on him finding a solution quickly. By early morning Sunday, the Syrian government said its forces had cleared the city of Arab tribal fighters, a development confirmed by several tribal leaders. The challenge will now be ensuring any ceasefire holds.

The Ukrainian president said his government was working to implement the agreements reached during the last set of talks in the Turkish city of Istanbul. That was the second round of peace talks between representatives of Russia and Ukraine in just over two weeks. Mr Zelenskyy said negotiations with Russia on the prisoners of war swaps, agreed at the most recent talks, were ongoing. But despite the agreement, no progress has so far been made towards ending the war, according to officials. Rustem Umerov, head of Ukraine's delegation, has suggested holding the third round of direct peace talks next week, according to the president. \"The negotiation dynamics need to be intensified.

The latest round of long-range attacks comes after Russia unleashed more than 700 drones on 8 July - a new record. Its stepped-up bombing campaign has dashed hopes for a breakthrough in the ongoing efforts to bring the war to an end, after more than three years of fighting.

        "Content": "\n          Royal correspondent\n              @SkyRhiannon\n  Watching pictures of Prince Harry in Angola this week took me back to 2019, when we were there for his first visit following in Princess Diana's footsteps. The pictures on Wednesday looked so similar; his effortless interactions with people who face the daily dangers of landmines, and his obvious passion to help a charity that he cares deeply about. Of course so much has happened in the six years since then, but with other headlines this week, I couldn't help but feel like we could be looking at the beginning of a reset for Harry. It started last Saturday night, as the story emerged of a meeting between the King's communications secretary, Harry's new London-based head of PR, and Harry's most senior aide in America. Three people you may not have heard of, but a meeting that was quickly described as \"peace talks\". The pictures of the get-together were being sold for thousands of pounds by the paper that ran them, just one indication of the global fascination about whether father and son may be on the road to reconciliation. Neither side are willing to go there when you ask what exactly they talked about, although I suspect some of it was much more practical than about trying to mend this fractured relationship. \n                  Prince Harry follows in Diana's footsteps - and returns to Angola to back landmine clearing charity \n                 \n                  Senior aides to King and Prince Harry pictured meeting in London\n                 \n                  Meghan shares video of trip to Disneyland with Prince Harry and children Archie and Lilibet\n                 Things like trying to avoid unnecessary negative stories, for example, the kind where Harry is accused of snubbing his father because they just happen to be doing jobs on the same day. It's tricky for Harry's camp to avoid such a situation when they don't have sight of the King's diary. There's also been the chatter about who may, or may not, have leaked the meeting. There has been speculation around why they were out on a balcony, and who spotted the photographer in the park. But whether it was a leak, or just a really good spot from a journalist or photographer, it's not a bad thing for either side that we're now all talking about whether father and son may be close to patching things up. It did however raise other questions, about what it means for Prince William and his relationship with his brother. So far there have been no indications of any meeting between William's team and that of his brother. The feelings of William also, you may think, a consideration for the King. The unexpected headlines around Harry just kept coming, as on Tuesday he popped up in Angola. His second visit there, this time with no press pack in tow. So why the surprise visit? Harry has worked with the Halo Trust for some time, and it's clearly still a priority for them to highlight the dangers faced by those living with the potential dangers of landmines in Angola. But it also feels like part of a push to get Harry out on more public engagements. I've been told that since moving away from the UK he has continued to have regular contact with those charities with which he's maintained ties, but being on the phone or a video call, isn't the same as physically being there in person. We saw something similar with his trip to China with Travalyst earlier this year, some may argue not the best choice of destination, but another example of wanting to get him physically out on visits to reinforce publicly those connections with causes that matter so much to him. Read more:Palace confirms date of Trump's state visitKing's state banquet for Macron in pictures  For some months now it's felt like Meghan has regained an element of control over how she wants to be seen. Just look at her social media accounts and the success of her \"As Ever\" brand. Whether Harry for the first time would step on to the social media scene with his own public account we wait to see, although the idea of his own commercial project is more likely, with suggestions something may be in the pipeline, we wait and see what. After a constant flow of stories in recent months relating to court cases or his ongoing row with his family, this week has felt different. A lot has been made about Harry and Meghan establishing a new \"court\" and what lies behind their decision to hire new people, five years after they stepped away from royal life. There are of course elements of the recent past that it is impossible to erase, even Harry, in his recent interview talked of how he would \"love reconciliation with my family\" but added, \"Of course, some members of my family will never forgive me for writing a book. Of course, they will never forgive me for... lots of things.\" But it does feel like their new team are tentatively attempting to push the reset button; getting Harry out on more engagements just one way they hope to focus our minds back on to what he has always done best."

        "Content": "\n          Midlands correspondent\n              @LisaSkyNews\n  It's lunchtime on Birmingham's New Street.Â  Close to its many restaurants, food delivery riders are congregating on their bikes. The area is packed with shoppers and workers. PC Paige Gartlan is approaching with other officers. She's on the lookout for illegally modified e-bikes - and she knows she'll find them here. \"You can physically tell by looking at the bike that it's generally going to be illegal - the battery pack is taped on to the sides and generally the size of the motor that's on the back wheel,\" she explains. Sky News has been invited on an operation by West Midlands Police to find these bikes and get them off the streets. PC Gartlan has been hit by one before. She's had to tackle a rider to the floor after he drove into her. \n                  'Reckless' driver who caused deaths of mother and daughter on Boxing Day jailed\n                 \n                  Unite votes to suspend Angela Rayner over Birmingham bin strike\n                 \n                  Man arrested on suspicion of murder after woman's body found in Birmingham\n                 Within minutes, she's spotted a suspicious-looking bike. The rider makes a run for it - followed by plain-clothed officers. PC Gartlan tests the bike - it's showing a top speed of 52km/hr on the speedometer - just over 30mph. The speed limit for e-bikes in the UK is 15.5mph when using electric power for assistance. I look up the street and another two riders have been detained. In less than an hour, officers have confiscated four bikes - all were being ridden by fast food delivery drivers. The commotion is attracting a lot of attention. \"They are dangerous,\" Sandra, who has just finished work, tells me. She's stood watching the riders being questioned. She says she's had near-misses herself and is worried for the safety of the elderly and children. It's not just West Midlands police officers here - immigration officials are carrying out checks too. They're involved in a nationwide operation, which has seen more than 7,000 arrests in the last year - a 50% increase on last year. Matthew Foster, the immigration enforcement lead officer for the West Midlands, tells me they've already found one individual who has entered the UK unlawfully. \"He's been detained,\" he says, \"to affect his removal from the UK.\" Further down the street, police are loading illegally modified bikes on to a van - they're destined to be crushed. One of them had belonged to Demoz.

I get in touch with the big delivery firms; Deliveroo, Uber Eats, and Just Eat. Their representatives say they constantly remind workers of their safety obligations, and that they're all working closely with the government to increase security checks on riders. As he leaves, Demoz, now bike-free, tells me he's thinking of changing his job."

The Ukrainian, 38, knocked Dubois down with a stunning right hook midway through round five, before finishing the job moments later with a devastating left hook to the chin of the 27-year-old. Dubois was bidding to avenge his previous loss to Usyk and become the UK's first undisputed heavyweight champion since Lennox Lewis in 1999. However, the 27-year-old now joins Tyson Fury and Anthony Joshua with two losses apiece to the undefeated Ukrainian. Commenting on the victory, Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said: \"He's done it again. An undisputed champion. A legend. One of our own. \"Thank you for the strength and inspiration you give to the whole country with every victory. Thank you for stepping into each fight with Ukraine in your heart. \"Congratulations on the win - to you, to our country, and to everyone who cheered you on.\" Usyk - who brought a group of Ukrainian war veterans to the fight - came in with the WBO, WBC and WBA belts, and Dubois the IBF. The 38-year-old previously had all four versions but gave up the IBF last year, with Dubois claiming the vacant belt with a devasting win over Anthony Joshua in September. In their previous fight, Usyk showed his class in Poland's Krakow in 2023, where Dubois was adjudged to have landed an illegal low blow in the fifth round. But the Ukrainian had been warned throughout fight week that he would face a \"different\" boxer on this occasion"

Seven people are said to be in a critical condition, while at least 23 others were injured, after a car drove into a crowd outside the nightclub. The fire department's Adam Van Gerpen told Sky's US partner, NBC News, that the car struck a taco cart before hitting people outside a nightclub at around 2am. Pictures from Santa Monica Boulevard, in East Hollywood, show a damaged grey Nissan Versa that had mounted the pavement. According to NBC News, cameras in the area are still being canvassed, but the incident appears to have been intentional, according to the Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD). The force later named the driver as 29-year-old Fernando Ramirez. He has been charged with assault with a deadly weapon. Officers \"found the driver being assaulted by bystanders and determined he had sustained a gunshot wound\", police said, adding that the wound was sustained after the collision. The LAPD say the person suspected of inflicting the gunshot wound - a man described by police as a 5ft 9in, bald, Hispanic, and possibly carrying a silver revolver - fled on foot. Sergeant Travis Ward said Ramirez had been taken to hospital for surgery, and it was currently unclear if he was intoxicated. He remains hospitalised and has not been booked into jail, the LAPD said.

        "Content": "The environment secretary has pledged to halve sewage pollution from water companies by 2030. The target - which is compared to 2024 levels - is to be announced by Steve Reed on Sunday morning - when the Labour minister is also set to appear on Sunday Morning with Trevor Phillips. The government says it is the first time ministers have set a clear target to reduce sewage pollution. The target is part of the government's efforts to respond to record sewage spills and rising water bills. Ministers are also aiming to cut phosphorus - which causes harmful algae blooms - in half by 2028. Mr Reed said families had watched rivers, coastlines and lakes \"suffer from record levels of pollution\". \"My pledge to you: the government will halve sewage pollution from water companies by the end of the decade,\" he added. The announcement comes ahead of the publication of the Independent Water Commission's landmark review into the sector on Monday morning. The commission was established by the UK and Welsh governments as part of their joint response to failures in the industry, but ministers have already said they'll stop short of nationalising water companies. On Friday, the Environment Agency published data which showed serious pollution incidents caused by water firms increased by 60% in England last year, compared with 2023.  Meanwhile, the watchdog has received a record Â£189m to support hundreds of enforcement officers for inspections and prosecutions. \"One of the largest infrastructure projects in England's history will clean up our rivers, lakes and seas for good,\" Mr Reed said. But the Conservatives have accused the Labour government of having so far \"simply copied previous Conservative government policy\". \"Labour's water plans must also include credible proposals to improve the water system's resilience to droughts, without placing an additional burden on bill payers and taxpayers,\" shadow environment secretary Victoria Atkins added. The Rivers Trust says sewage and wastewater discharges have taken place over the weekend, amid thunderstorms in parts of the UK. Discharges take place to prevent the system from becoming overwhelmed, with storm overflows used to release extra wastewater and rainwater into rivers and seas. Water company Southern Water said storm releases are part of the way sewage and drainage systems across the world protect homes, schools and hospitals from flooding. Environment Secretary Steve Reed is due to appear on Sunday Morning with Trevor Phillips at 8.30am on Sky News."

In the viral clip, the pair are shown on a screen with their arms around each other during the British band's concert at the Gillette Stadium, in Boston, Massachusetts, on 16 July. Once both of them realised they were being projected, the man quickly ducked out of view while the woman turned to hide her face from the camera. Appearing to poke fun at the couple, Coldplay lead singer Chris Martin is heard on the clip saying: \"Either they're having an affair or they're just very shy.\" The awkward encounter sent the internet into a frenzy, with the video gaining millions of views on social media and reports emerging that the two were executives from New York-based tech company Astronomer.

The Wonder Sea boat was reportedly carrying 53 people, including five crew members, when it capsized due to strong winds in Ha Long Bay on Saturday. It happened at roughly 2pm local time (7am GMT). Rescue teams have found 11 survivors and recovered 34 bodies, eight of them children, the state-run Vietnam News Agency said, citing local authorities. The People's Army Newspaper, which cited local border guards, said authorities have not yet confirmed details about the tourists, including their nationalities, as the rescue operation continues. Most of the passengers were tourists, including about 20 children, from the country's capital city, Hanoi, the newspaper said. The incident comes shortly after the arrival of Storm Wipha in the South China Sea, bringing strong winds, heavy rain and lightning to the area.

As well as in London's Parliament Square, demonstrations were also held in Manchester, Edinburgh, Bristol and Truro after the group was officially designated as a proscribed terrorist organisation two weeks ago. Protesters gathered in Parliament Square in Westminster carrying white placards with the message: \"I oppose genocide, I support Palestine Action.\" Some were carried away by officers, while others were led away in handcuffs. The Metropolitan Police said in a post on X: \"55 people were arrested in Parliament Square for displaying placards in support of Palestine Action, which is a proscribed group.\" The arrests were made under Section 13 of the Terrorism Act 2000, which carries a maximum six-month prison sentence. The force said a further nine people were arrested for supporting Palestine Action within a separate large-scale march to Whitehall on Saturday by the Palestine Coalition. Greater Manchester Police said it arrested 18 people on suspicion of support of a proscribed organisation, adding that they remained in custody for questioning. Avon and Somerset Police said 17 people were arrested during a protest in Bristol, while eight people were arrested near Truro Cathedral in Cornwall after protesters gathered to show support for Palestine Action.  by Charlotte Leeming - North of England correspondent  In the pouring rain, a small group of protesters sat silently on stones in front of the Gandhi statue in Manchester city centre. Within an hour of their arrival, each of them was arrested and taken away in police vans.  Not for what they said or chanted, but because of the signs they held. Handwritten placards with the words \"I oppose genocide, I support Palestine Action\" - now potentially an offence under the terrorism act.  16 people were swiftly arrested one after the other. Some had to be carried off, while others were led away in handcuffs.  The fast-moving events drew a crowd and were filmed by onlookers on their phones. At one point, a police woman asked people to stand back, so officers could do their jobs.  One man shouted, \"I wouldn't like it if that was my grandma being arrested.\" But the protestors said they came prepared to spend a few hours in the cells. They looked unphased as the van doors were closed behind them. With a large protest being planned for next month in London, activists say they're willing to break the law again for what they believe in, even if those actions could lead to 14 years in prison.  Seventy people were arrested at similar demonstrations in Parliament Square over the past two weekends. Eight people were arrested near Truro Cathedral under Section 13, Devon and Cornwall Police said, while protesters have also been arrested at a demonstration in Manchester. Before Saturday's protests, Defend Our Juries, which is coordinating the campaign, said a total of 120 people had previously been arrested across the UK. The Met warned anyone expressing support for Palestine Action would likely face arrest and that officers would be on the lookout for chants similar to \"death to the IDF\" led by punk rap duo Bob Vylan at Glastonbury Festival. Home Secretary Yvette Cooper announced plans to proscribe Palestine Action after two Voyager aircraft were allegedly damaged at RAF Brize Norton in Oxfordshire on 20 June, which police said caused around Â£7m worth of damage. The ban means that membership of, or support for, the direct action group is now a criminal offence punishable by up to 14 years in prison, under the Terrorism Act 2000. Even wearing a T-shirt or badge with the group's name on attracts a maximum six-month sentence. Huda Ammori, the co-founder of Palestine Action, is seeking to challenge the ban, with a hearing for permission to bring a judicial review set to take place at the High Court on Monday."

The area is packed with shoppers and workers. PC Paige Gartlan is approaching with other officers. She's on the lookout for illegally modified e-bikes - and she knows she'll find them here. \"You can physically tell by looking at the bike that it's generally going to be illegal - the battery pack is taped on to the sides and generally the size of the motor that's on the back wheel,\" she explains. Sky News has been invited on an operation by West Midlands Police to find these bikes and get them off the streets. PC Gartlan has been hit by one before.

The speed limit for e-bikes in the UK is 15.5mph when using electric power for assistance. I look up the street and another two riders have been detained. In less than an hour, officers have confiscated four bikes - all were being ridden by fast food delivery drivers. The commotion is attracting a lot of attention. \"They are dangerous,\" Sandra, who has just finished work, tells me. She's stood watching the riders being questioned. She says she's had near-misses herself and is worried for the safety of the elderly and children. It's not just West Midlands police officers here - immigration officials are carrying out checks too.

I get in touch with the big delivery firms; Deliveroo, Uber Eats, and Just Eat. Their representatives say they constantly remind workers of their safety obligations, and that they're all working closely with the government to increase security checks on riders. As he leaves, Demoz, now bike-free, tells me he's thinking of changing his job."

        "Content": "\n          Royal correspondent\n              @SkyRhiannon\n  Watching pictures of Prince Harry in Angola this week took me back to 2019, when we were there for his first visit following in Princess Diana's footsteps. The pictures on Wednesday looked so similar; his effortless interactions with people who face the daily dangers of landmines, and his obvious passion to help a charity that he cares deeply about. Of course so much has happened in the six years since then, but with other headlines this week, I couldn't help but feel like we could be looking at the beginning of a reset for Harry. It started last Saturday night, as the story emerged of a meeting between the King's communications secretary, Harry's new London-based head of PR, and Harry's most senior aide in America. Three people you may not have heard of, but a meeting that was quickly described as \"peace talks\". The pictures of the get-together were being sold for thousands of pounds by the paper that ran them, just one indication of the global fascination about whether father and son may be on the road to reconciliation. Neither side are willing to go there when you ask what exactly they talked about, although I suspect some of it was much more practical than about trying to mend this fractured relationship. \n                  Prince Harry follows in Diana's footsteps - and returns to Angola to back landmine clearing charity \n                 \n                  Senior aides to King and Prince Harry pictured meeting in London\n                 \n                  Meghan shares video of trip to Disneyland with Prince Harry and children Archie and Lilibet\n                 Things like trying to avoid unnecessary negative stories, for example, the kind where Harry is accused of snubbing his father because they just happen to be doing jobs on the same day. It's tricky for Harry's camp to avoid such a situation when they don't have sight of the King's diary. There's also been the chatter about who may, or may not, have leaked the meeting. There has been speculation around why they were out on a balcony, and who spotted the photographer in the park. But whether it was a leak, or just a really good spot from a journalist or photographer, it's not a bad thing for either side that we're now all talking about whether father and son may be close to patching things up. It did however raise other questions, about what it means for Prince William and his relationship with his brother. So far there have been no indications of any meeting between William's team and that of his brother. The feelings of William also, you may think, a consideration for the King. The unexpected headlines around Harry just kept coming, as on Tuesday he popped up in Angola. His second visit there, this time with no press pack in tow. So why the surprise visit? Harry has worked with the Halo Trust for some time, and it's clearly still a priority for them to highlight the dangers faced by those living with the potential dangers of landmines in Angola. But it also feels like part of a push to get Harry out on more public engagements. I've been told that since moving away from the UK he has continued to have regular contact with those charities with which he's maintained ties, but being on the phone or a video call, isn't the same as physically being there in person. We saw something similar with his trip to China with Travalyst earlier this year, some may argue not the best choice of destination, but another example of wanting to get him physically out on visits to reinforce publicly those connections with causes that matter so much to him. Read more:Palace confirms date of Trump's state visitKing's state banquet for Macron in pictures  For some months now it's felt like Meghan has regained an element of control over how she wants to be seen. Just look at her social media accounts and the success of her \"As Ever\" brand. Whether Harry for the first time would step on to the social media scene with his own public account we wait to see, although the idea of his own commercial project is more likely, with suggestions something may be in the pipeline, we wait and see what. After a constant flow of stories in recent months relating to court cases or his ongoing row with his family, this week has felt different. A lot has been made about Harry and Meghan establishing a new \"court\" and what lies behind their decision to hire new people, five years after they stepped away from royal life. There are of course elements of the recent past that it is impossible to erase, even Harry, in his recent interview talked of how he would \"love reconciliation with my family\" but added, \"Of course, some members of my family will never forgive me for writing a book. Of course, they will never forgive me for... lots of things.\" But it does feel like their new team are tentatively attempting to push the reset button; getting Harry out on more engagements just one way they hope to focus our minds back on to what he has always done best."

        "Content": "The environment secretary has pledged to halve sewage pollution from water companies by 2030. The target - which is compared to 2024 levels - is to be announced by Steve Reed on Sunday morning - when the Labour minister is also set to appear on Sunday Morning with Trevor Phillips. The government says it is the first time ministers have set a clear target to reduce sewage pollution. The target is part of the government's efforts to respond to record sewage spills and rising water bills. Ministers are also aiming to cut phosphorus - which causes harmful algae blooms - in half by 2028. Mr Reed said families had watched rivers, coastlines and lakes \"suffer from record levels of pollution\". \"My pledge to you: the government will halve sewage pollution from water companies by the end of the decade,\" he added. The announcement comes ahead of the publication of the Independent Water Commission's landmark review into the sector on Monday morning. The commission was established by the UK and Welsh governments as part of their joint response to failures in the industry, but ministers have already said they'll stop short of nationalising water companies. On Friday, the Environment Agency published data which showed serious pollution incidents caused by water firms increased by 60% in England last year, compared with 2023.  Meanwhile, the watchdog has received a record Â£189m to support hundreds of enforcement officers for inspections and prosecutions. \"One of the largest infrastructure projects in England's history will clean up our rivers, lakes and seas for good,\" Mr Reed said. But the Conservatives have accused the Labour government of having so far \"simply copied previous Conservative government policy\". \"Labour's water plans must also include credible proposals to improve the water system's resilience to droughts, without placing an additional burden on bill payers and taxpayers,\" shadow environment secretary Victoria Atkins added. The Rivers Trust says sewage and wastewater discharges have taken place over the weekend, amid thunderstorms in parts of the UK. Discharges take place to prevent the system from becoming overwhelmed, with storm overflows used to release extra wastewater and rainwater into rivers and seas. Water company Southern Water said storm releases are part of the way sewage and drainage systems across the world protect homes, schools and hospitals from flooding. Environment Secretary Steve Reed is due to appear on Sunday Morning with Trevor Phillips at 8.30am on Sky News."

The Ukrainian, 38, knocked Dubois down with a stunning right hook midway through round five, before finishing the job moments later with a devastating left hook to the chin of the 27-year-old. Dubois was bidding to avenge his previous loss to Usyk and become the UK's first undisputed heavyweight champion since Lennox Lewis in 1999. However, the 27-year-old now joins Tyson Fury and Anthony Joshua with two losses apiece to the undefeated Ukrainian. Commenting on the victory, Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said: \"He's done it again. An undisputed champion. A legend. One of our own. \"Thank you for the strength and inspiration you give to the whole country with every victory. Thank you for stepping into each fight with Ukraine in your heart. \"Congratulations on the win - to you, to our country, and to everyone who cheered you on.\" Usyk - who brought a group of Ukrainian war veterans to the fight - came in with the WBO, WBC and WBA belts, and Dubois the IBF. The 38-year-old previously had all four versions but gave up the IBF last year, with Dubois claiming the vacant belt with a devasting win over Anthony Joshua in September. In their previous fight, Usyk showed his class in Poland's Krakow in 2023, where Dubois was adjudged to have landed an illegal low blow in the fifth round. But the Ukrainian had been warned throughout fight week that he would face a \"different\" boxer on this occasion"

Obviously ours didn't start so well but we've had three must-win games that we've come through now. \"It's really exciting and a lot of fun for the fans back home, seeing us get to these crucial moments of tournaments.\" Morgan came on with 20 minutes to go against the Swedes as England scored two late goals to set up a nail-biting penalty shootout. \n                  England through to semi-final of Women's Euros after dramatic win over Sweden on penalties\n                 \n                  England through to Women's Euros quarter-finals - and send Wales crashing out\n                 \n                  What England and Wales need from Women's Euro 2025 clash to qualify for next round\n                 She praised her fellow sub Michelle Agyemang, 19, whose goal kept them in the game - as well as the inspiration provided by \"freak\" England legend Lucy Bronze.

All eyes are now on Tuesday's clash with Italy in Geneva. The holders are strong favourites due to their record at big tournaments, with the Italians having never made a semi-final since 1997. If they win, it could set up a re-run of their World Cup final against Spain two years ago. The Spaniards will play either France or Germany in their last-four match on Wednesday."

        "Content": "\n          Science correspondent\n              @SkyNewsThomas\n  It doesn't take much for Britain's sewerage system to be overwhelmed. Heavy rain had been forecast for the southeast of England on Saturday morning, with an amber weather warning issued. In fact, the downpours weren't as intense as feared - and they were brief. Yet, sewage overflows across the region quickly began discharging into rivers. Read more: Environment secretary pledges to cut sewage pollution from water companies in half by 2030 Data from The Rivers Trust shows that at midday on Saturday there were 75 outlets actively pouring effluent into rivers in the southeast. And another 164 had been discharging in the previous 48 hours. It's been worse - far worse - in the past. But the sewage was being discharged into rivers heavily impacted by weeks of hot, dry weather. While the amber warning may have expired, there is more wet weather on the way over the coming days. A yellow weather warning for thunderstorms remains in place for most of England, apart from the southwest, until 9pm on Saturday. A yellow warning for rain affecting most of the southwest of England and South Wales is in place until 9pm on Sunday, with another in place for most of mainland Scotland until 12pm on Sunday. The majority of England and Scotland are also set to be impacted by thunderstorms on Monday, with a yellow warning in place from 11am until 9pm. The Met Office said a few places may experience flooding and disruption. Not only was the water temperature higher than normal, reducing oxygen levels and encouraging blooms of algae, but river levels were low, so there was less water to dilute the sewage. It's a double whammy for aquatic life. It reflects years of underinvestment in the infrastructure. The crumbling sewerage system hasn't kept pace with the growth in the population. The priority of the water regulator Ofwat has been to keep customer bills low, at the expense of the environment. And we are now paying the price. The Water Commission's report next week is expected to recommend much tighter regulation in future, and Ofwat is likely to be abolished. But it will take billions of pounds and many years to clean up our rivers."

        "Content": "By Alex Crawford, special correspondent reporting from inside the besieged Syrian city of Sweida   Warning: This article contains details that some people may find disturbing. We found the streets of Sweida city strewn with mutilated, burned and decomposing bodies as government security forces struggled to enforce the first day of a US-brokered ceasefire. Large sections of the city seemed to be on fire as we entered the besieged, mainly Druze, city. There were multiple buildings, homes, flats, shops and businesses ravaged by flames. We saw marauding groups of Arab tribal fighters breaking into homes and setting them alight. Others were spotted loading up vehicles with all sorts of goods. One vehicle had a gaggle of geese on board. Others were stocked up with shrubbery. Yet more had mattresses, cupboards and fridges. The new president sent his security forces down to the southern city to try to prevent yet more Arab tribal fighters from entering. But early on in the day, we spotted large convoys of armed men pushing their way through the few checkpoints. We did not see any government forces inside the centre while we were there, and they seemed to keep mainly to the outskirts. Inside the centre, there were continuing fierce battles for most of the day, between Druze militia led by cleric Hikmat al Hajiri and the Arab fighters supporting their Bedouin brethren. One Druze woman was shot by a sniper whilst she stood on her balcony. Her face was covered in blood, but somehow she survived despite a bullet going straight through one side of her jaw and out the other. She had also been hit on her shoulder and one arm. She was brought to a field hospital outside the city for treatment by Bedouin fighters. She said she had no idea which of the battling factions was responsible for shooting her. Two humanitarian corridors are being created to allow the estimated 30,000 trapped civilians to exit. A fleet of coaches with White Helmets flags flying has been sent to the perimeter of the city to prepare for civilians to come out.

His words of reassurance and inclusivity for all ethnic groups in Syria are failing to persuade some of the minority Druze and Arab Bedouin groups to lay down their arms. How the sectarian clashes are resolved is likely to determine how successful his presidency is, and tens of thousands of lives are dependent on him finding a solution quickly. By early morning Sunday, the Syrian government said its forces had cleared the city of Arab tribal fighters, a development confirmed by several tribal leaders. The challenge will now be ensuring any ceasefire holds.

        "Content": "\n          US correspondent\n              @marthakelner\n  On Friday, Paola Paiva waited in a hotel near Caracas airport, nervous but giddy with excitement to be reunited with her brother, finally.  For five months, Arturo Suarez has been detained in a notorious prison in El Salvador. \"I am going to wait for my brother to call me,\" she told Sky News, \"and after giving him a hug, I want to just listen to him, listen to his voice. Let him talk and tell us his story.\" Suarez was one of the more than 250 Venezuelan migrants who had been living in America but were arrested in immigration raids by the Trump administration and sent to El Salvador, a showpiece act in the president's promise to deport millions of migrants. Most of the men had never even been to El Salvador before. Their detention has been controversial because the White House claims the men are all part of the dangerous Tren de Aragua gang but has provided little evidence to support this assertion. The only evidence Paola had that Suarez was still alive was a picture of him published on a news website showing the inside of the maximum security CECOT jail. He is one of dozens of men with their hands and feet cuffed, heads shaved and bodies shackled together. \n                  Trump100 Day 92: Is Trump's deportation policy firm or cruel?  \n                 \n                  Day 91: Q&A - deportations, dollar bills and MAGA hats  \n                 \n                  Donald Trump's deportations explained\n                 Now he is returning to his home country, one of the bargaining chips in a deal that saw the release of ten Americans and US permanent residents who had been seized by the Venezuelan authorities. Paola had tried to go to the airport to greet her brother as he disembarked a charter plane bringing the men back from El Salvador but authorities told her to wait at a nearby hotel. \"They told us they are taking them all to a hotel to rest,\" she said. \"But I managed to get someone to give my phone number on a piece of paper to my brother, so I am expecting his call tomorrow, as soon as he can access a phone. \"We heard they are going to perform some medical exams on them and check their criminal records,\" she added. \"I'm not afraid; I'm not worried since my brother has a clean record. \"I am so happy. I knew this day would happen, and that it would be unexpected, that no one was going to notify us. I knew it was going to be a total surprise.\" The Trump administration had paid the El Salvador government, led by President Nayib Bukele, millions of dollars to imprison the men. Homeland security secretary Kristi Noem visited CECOT last month, posing in front of prisoners for a photo opportunity.

A video which was seemingly filmed aboard the charter flight bringing the Venezuelan migrants back to Caracas shows Arturo briefly talking about his experience inside. He looks physically well but speaks into the camera and says: \"We were four months with no communication, no phone calls, kidnapped, we didn't know what (the) day was, not even the time. \"We were beat up at breakfast, lunch and dinner,\" he continues. Sky News interviewed Arturo Suarez's brother Nelson near his home in the US in April, weeks after Arturo - an aspiring singer - had been arrested by immigration and customs enforcement (ICE) agents while filming a music video inside a house. Nelson said he believed Arturo's only crime was \"being Venezuelan and having tattoos.\" He showed me documents that indicate Arturo has no criminal record in Venezuela, Chile, Colombia or the United States, the four countries he has lived in. Now Nelson is delighted Arturo is being released - but worries for his future. \"The only thing that casts a shadow in such a moment of joy is that bit of anger when I think that all the governments involved are going to use my brother's story, and the others on that flight, as political gain,\" he said. \"Each of them will tell a different story, making themselves the heroes, when the reality is that many innocent people suffered unfairly and unnecessarily, and many families will remain separated after this incident due to politics, immigration and fear.\""

The deaths occurred near distribution hubs operated by the US-Israeli-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF), which began distributing food packages in Gaza at the end of May, after Israel eased its 11-week blockade of aid into the territory. At least 32 people were killed on Saturday, according to the Hamas-run Gaza health ministry, while a further 100 people were injured, according to local reports. Most of the deaths came as Palestinians massed in the Teina area, around 3km (2 miles) away from a GHF aid distribution centre east of the city of Khan Younis. Mahmoud Mokeimar said he was walking with crowds of people - mostly young men - towards the food hub when troops fired warning shots as the crowd advanced, before opening fire towards the marching people. \"It was a massacre... the occupation opened fire at us indiscriminately,\" he said.

Seven other people, including one woman, were killed in the Shakoush area, hundreds of yards north of another GHF hub in Gaza's southernmost city of Rafah, the hospital said. The army and GHF did not immediately comment on Saturday's violence. The GFH, which has four distribution centres, three of which are in the southern Gaza Strip, says it has distributed millions of meals to hungry Palestinians. But local health officials and witnesses say hundreds of people have been killed by Israeli army fire as they try to reach the distribution hubs. The GHF, which employs private armed guards, says there have been no deadly shootings at its sites, though this week, 20 people were killed at one of its locations, most of them in a stampede.

Seven people are said to be in a critical condition, while at least 23 others were injured, after a car drove into a crowd outside the nightclub. The fire department's Adam Van Gerpen told Sky's US partner, NBC News, that the car struck a taco cart before hitting people outside a nightclub at around 2am. Pictures from Santa Monica Boulevard, in East Hollywood, show a damaged grey Nissan Versa that had mounted the pavement. According to NBC News, cameras in the area are still being canvassed, but the incident appears to have been intentional, according to the Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD). The force later named the driver as 29-year-old Fernando Ramirez. He has been charged with assault with a deadly weapon. Officers \"found the driver being assaulted by bystanders and determined he had sustained a gunshot wound\", police said, adding that the wound was sustained after the collision. The LAPD say the person suspected of inflicting the gunshot wound - a man described by police as a 5ft 9in, bald, Hispanic, and possibly carrying a silver revolver - fled on foot. Sergeant Travis Ward said Ramirez had been taken to hospital for surgery, and it was currently unclear if he was intoxicated. He remains hospitalised and has not been booked into jail, the LAPD said.

        "Content": "\n          US correspondent\n              @marthakelner\n  On Friday, Paola Paiva waited in a hotel near Caracas airport, nervous but giddy with excitement to be reunited with her brother, finally.  For five months, Arturo Suarez has been detained in a notorious prison in El Salvador. \"I am going to wait for my brother to call me,\" she told Sky News, \"and after giving him a hug, I want to just listen to him, listen to his voice. Let him talk and tell us his story.\" Suarez was one of the more than 250 Venezuelan migrants who had been living in America but were arrested in immigration raids by the Trump administration and sent to El Salvador, a showpiece act in the president's promise to deport millions of migrants. Most of the men had never even been to El Salvador before. Their detention has been controversial because the White House claims the men are all part of the dangerous Tren de Aragua gang but has provided little evidence to support this assertion. The only evidence Paola had that Suarez was still alive was a picture of him published on a news website showing the inside of the maximum security CECOT jail. He is one of dozens of men with their hands and feet cuffed, heads shaved and bodies shackled together. \n                  Trump100 Day 92: Is Trump's deportation policy firm or cruel?  \n                 \n                  Day 91: Q&A - deportations, dollar bills and MAGA hats  \n                 \n                  Donald Trump's deportations explained\n                 Now he is returning to his home country, one of the bargaining chips in a deal that saw the release of ten Americans and US permanent residents who had been seized by the Venezuelan authorities. Paola had tried to go to the airport to greet her brother as he disembarked a charter plane bringing the men back from El Salvador but authorities told her to wait at a nearby hotel. \"They told us they are taking them all to a hotel to rest,\" she said. \"But I managed to get someone to give my phone number on a piece of paper to my brother, so I am expecting his call tomorrow, as soon as he can access a phone. \"We heard they are going to perform some medical exams on them and check their criminal records,\" she added. \"I'm not afraid; I'm not worried since my brother has a clean record. \"I am so happy. I knew this day would happen, and that it would be unexpected, that no one was going to notify us. I knew it was going to be a total surprise.\" The Trump administration had paid the El Salvador government, led by President Nayib Bukele, millions of dollars to imprison the men. Homeland security secretary Kristi Noem visited CECOT last month, posing in front of prisoners for a photo opportunity.

A video which was seemingly filmed aboard the charter flight bringing the Venezuelan migrants back to Caracas shows Arturo briefly talking about his experience inside. He looks physically well but speaks into the camera and says: \"We were four months with no communication, no phone calls, kidnapped, we didn't know what (the) day was, not even the time. \"We were beat up at breakfast, lunch and dinner,\" he continues. Sky News interviewed Arturo Suarez's brother Nelson near his home in the US in April, weeks after Arturo - an aspiring singer - had been arrested by immigration and customs enforcement (ICE) agents while filming a music video inside a house. Nelson said he believed Arturo's only crime was \"being Venezuelan and having tattoos.\" He showed me documents that indicate Arturo has no criminal record in Venezuela, Chile, Colombia or the United States, the four countries he has lived in. Now Nelson is delighted Arturo is being released - but worries for his future. \"The only thing that casts a shadow in such a moment of joy is that bit of anger when I think that all the governments involved are going to use my brother's story, and the others on that flight, as political gain,\" he said. \"Each of them will tell a different story, making themselves the heroes, when the reality is that many innocent people suffered unfairly and unnecessarily, and many families will remain separated after this incident due to politics, immigration and fear.\""

        "Headline": "Richard Monks, who spent 18 years at the City watchdog, is the leading candidate to oversee a radical overhaul of the way English football is regulated, Sky News can exclusively reveal.",
        "Content": "\n          City editor\n              @MarkKleinmanSky\n An expert in financial regulation at one of the big four accountancy firms is in talks to become the inaugural boss of English football's powerful new watchdog. Sky News has learnt that Richard Monks, a partner at EY, is the leading contender to become chief executive of the Independent Football Regulator (IFR). The new body will be formally established once the Football Governance Bill receives Royal Assent, which is expected this month. Mr Monks spent 18 years at the Financial Conduct Authority and its predecessor regulator, the Financial Services Authority, before becoming chair of the G20/OECD Taskforce for Consumer Financial Protection, according to his LinkedIn profile. He became a partner at EY, where he focuses on financial regulation, in the autumn of 2022. The prospective choice of a chief executive of the IFR with no professional experience of the football industry may spark alarm among club executives who will face an onerous new regulatory regime overseen by the IFR. In recent weeks, football industry executives have circulated rumours that the IFR boss was likely to emerge from the professional services sector. \n                  CVC kicks off refinancing plan for Â£9bn portfolio of sports assets\n                 \n                  Ofwat could be scrapped in water reforms\n                 \n                  Money latest: The supermarkets which surprised our top wine experts - and their best summer bottles for under Â£10\n                 It was unclear this weekend whether other candidates were vying with Mr Monks for the post. The IFR has already been set up on a 'shadow' basis, with Martyn Henderson, former chief executive of the Sports Grounds Safety Authority, appointed in December 2023 as interim chief operating officer of the football watchdog. The EY partner is understood to have held talks with David Kogan, the government's preferred choice for the watchdog's chairmanship but whose formal appointment has been delayed by an investigation sparked by his previous donations to Labour politicians. William Shawcross, the commissioner for public appointments, is investigating the process through which Mr Kogan was recruited to the role, and is thought likely to produce his report in the coming weeks. Lisa Nandy, the culture secretary, told MPs last month that she was delegating the final decision on Mr Kogan's appointment to the sports minister. Stuart Andrew, the shadow culture minister, said at the time: \"The public has a right to know whether this was a fair and impartial process, or yet another case of political patronage disguised as due diligence. \"The decision to launch an inquiry is welcome [and] must include scrutiny of [Sir] Keir Starmer, his advisers, and whether any conflicts of interest were properly declared.\" If Mr Kogan's appointment is ratified, the appointment of a chief executive would be a crucial step in paving the way for the most radical reforms to the supervision of English football in decades. The legislation includes a new licensing regime for clubs, measures to ensure greater fan engagement and a backstop power allowing the IFR to impose a financial settlement on the Premier League in relation to distributions to English Football League clubs. Revisions to the Bill have seen a requirement for the IFR to take decisions about club takeovers in the context of the government's foreign and trade policy removed. If Mr Monks does land the IFR chief executive's post, ministers are likely to argue that his expertise as a regulator will balance Mr Kogan's decades of experience as a negotiator of sports media rights deals. Last year, Mr Kogan acted as the lead negotiator for the Women's Super League and Championship on their latest five-year broadcasting deals with Sky - the immediate parent company of Sky News - and the BBC.

The creation of the IFR was pledged by the last Conservative government in the wake of the furore over the failed European Super League project in 2021. Its establishment comes with the top tier of the professional game gripped by civil war, with Abu Dhabi-owned Manchester City at the centre of a number of legal cases with the Premier League over the club's financial affairs. The Premier League has also been keen to agree a long-delayed financial redistribution deal with the EFL before the regulator is formally launched. Tentative talks between representatives of both factions failed to produce meaningful progress, however. This weekend, EY declined to comment on Mr Monks's behalf, while the Department for Culture, Media and Sport has been approached for comment."

        "Content": "\n          City editor\n              @MarkKleinmanSky\n The owner of stakes in Six Nations and Premiership Rugby and the top flights of French and Spanish football is plotting refinancing expected to value its sports portfolio at more than Â£9bn. Sky News has learnt that CVC Capital Partners has hired Goldman Sachs, PJT Partners and Raine Group to advise on a deal involving SportsCo, a new entity established to optimise the buyout giant's investments in the sector. City sources said this weekend that the refinancing was likely to involve raising new debt against one of the largest private equity-owned sports portfolios in the world. CVC also owns stakes in international volleyball, the women's professional tennis tour and Indian Premier League cricket. Sources said the refinancing would enable CVC to remain invested in its sports portfolio for longer, while also paving the way for the sale of a minority stake in SportsCo or a future initial public offering. Last month, Sky News revealed that Marc Allera, the former boss of mobile phone network EE, had been recruited as chairman of SportsCo. The creation of SportsCo is aimed at providing more cohesive support to CVC's investments across the sector. \n                  EY partner in talks to become boss of new football regulator\n                 \n                  Ofwat could be scrapped in water reforms\n                 \n                  Money latest: The supermarkets which surprised our top wine experts - and their best summer bottles for under Â£10\n                 Having made billions of dollars from its ownership of Formula One motor racing - one of the most lucrative deals in the history of sport - CVC has bought stakes in leagues and other assets spanning cricket, football, rugby union, tennis and volleyball over the last two decades. Its investment in the media rights to La Liga - Spain's equivalent of the Premier League - is expected to generate a handsome return for the firm, although a comparable deal in France has faced significant challenges amid broadcasters' financial challenges in the country. CVC's backing of global sports properties is intended to position it to maximise their commercial potential through new media and sponsorship rights deals, as well as their expansion into new formats aimed at drawing wider audiences amid rapid shifts in media consumption. In rugby union, its acquisition of a stake in Premiership Rugby's commercial rights was hit by the pandemic and the subsequent financial pressures on clubs which saw a number of the league's teams forced into insolvency. CVC, which bought into Premiership Rugby in 2019, owns a 27% stake in the league. Under its stewardship, broadcast audiences and attendances have turned a corner, with total TV audiences up 40% this year - partly as a result of an increase in the number of games being shown. It recently agreed a more lucrative TV rights deal for the league. Sponsorship revenues are also said to have nearly doubled since CVC's initial investment, with fan interest among the crucial 18-34 age demographic rising by 30% during the last year. Its SportsCo strategy will see Mr Allera, who also chaired BT Sport, working across the CVC sports portfolio, with other executives expected to be recruited to assist the effort in due course. One source last month likened the initiative to the approach employed by the luxury goods conglomerate LVMH. They added that there would be parallels with the sharing of best practice used at US basketball's NBA through its TeamBusinessOperations (TeamBO) unit to unlock collective opportunities and drive further long-term growth projects. CVC's sporting assets will continue to remain autonomous and independent of one another. One expected benefit of the SportsCo approach would be the sourcing of new investment opportunities in future years, with another likely to mean CVC remaining a stakeholder in its existing portfolio for a longer duration. SportsCo could be used as an acquisition vehicle for future CVC deals in the industry. The firm was recently outbid in an auction of major tennis tournaments by Ari Emanuel, the Endeavor founder whose company was also the seller of the assets. Global sports properties have become one of the hottest growth areas for private capital in recent years, with firms such as Ares Management, Silver Lake Partners and Bridgepoint all investing substantial sums in teams, leagues and other assets across the industry. CVC could not be reached for comment on Saturday."
