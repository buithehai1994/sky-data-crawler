        "Content": " Iran's response to Israeli attacks on its nuclear facilities is \"self-defence\" and a \"matter of principle\", the Iranian ambassador to the UK has told Sky News. Speaking exclusively to The World With Yalda Hakim, Seyed Ali Mousavi said the \"barbaric Israeli regime\" is \"violating international law\" - describing Israel's actions in recent days as \"an act of aggression against the Iranian people\". The conflict between Israel and Iran - once played out in a series of proxy wars - has escalated in the past three days. Follow Israel-Iran conflict live  On Friday morning, explosions hit Tehran as Israel carried out a major attack on its top army leaders, nuclear sites, and nuclear scientists. Iran threatened \"severe punishment\" and quickly retaliated with a wave of missiles.   When questioned about whether Iran could continue fighting Israel, the Iranian ambassador told Yalda Hakim that \"it is a matter of principle\". He said: \"This is about self-defence, there is no doubt about it. \"We are a responsible member state of the UN and we do all activities according to our international obligations. \"Any activities are only in the framework of self-defence.\" He added that his country would \"do our best to preserve our territorial integrity\", and that \"with the help of God\", Iran will \"materialise endeavours concretely against our enemy - the Israeli regime\". Mr Mousavi also told Hakim that Iran's nuclear activities are \"monitored\", and that recent comments by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) were \"politically motivated\". ðŸ‘‰Listen to The World with Richard Engel and Yalda Hakim on your podcast appðŸ‘ˆ Read more here:How conflict between Israel and Iran unfoldedUK advises against all travel to IsraelExplosions over Jerusalem as missiles 'detected' by IDF  The UN nuclear watchdog's board of governors found Iran was not complying with its nuclear obligations for the first time in 20 years. Iran said it has \"always adhered\" to the safeguarding obligations laid down by the watchdog.  Announcing Operation Rising Lion on Friday, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu claimed Iran had recently taken steps to weaponise enriched uranium, which could be used to make nuclear weapons. But Mr Mousavi stressed that Iran's \"peaceful activities\" at its \"nuclear fields\" were only for the \"generation of electricity, and other peaceful\" things. Iran was due to continue its round of negotiations with the US in Muscat - however, this was cancelled, given recent tensions."

She will take over from Sir Richard Moore as the 18th Chief, also known as \"C\", when he steps down in the autumn. \"The historic appointment of Blaise Metreweli comes at a time when the work of our intelligence services has never been more vital,\" Sir Keir Starmer said in a statement released on Sunday night. \"The United Kingdom is facing threats on an unprecedented scale - be it aggressors who send their spy ships to our waters or hackers whose sophisticated cyber plots seek to disrupt our public services.\"  Of the other main spy agencies, GCHQ is also under female command for the first time. Anne Keast-Butler took on the role in 2023, while MI5 has previously twice been led by a woman. Until now, a female spy chief had only headed MI6 - also known as the Secret Intelligence Service (SIS) - in the James Bond movies. Dame Judi Dench held the fictional role - called \"M\" in the films instead of \"C\" - between 1995 and 2015. Ms Metreweli currently serves as \"Q\", one of four director generals inside MI6. The position - also made famous by the James Bond films, with the fictional \"Q\" producing an array of spy gadgets - means she is responsible for technology and innovation. Ms Metreweli, a Cambridge graduate, joined MI6 in 1999. Unlike the outgoing chief, who spent some of his service as a regular diplomat in the foreign office, including as ambassador to Turkey, she has spent her entire career as an intelligence officer. Much of that time was dedicated to operational roles in the Middle East and Europe. Ms Metreweli, who is highly regarded by colleagues, also worked as a director at MI5.

        "Content": "\n          Ireland correspondent\n              @SMurphyTV\n A long-awaited forensic excavation at a former 'mother and baby home', where the remains of almost 800 babies and children are believed to be buried, will start today in County Galway. Many of the children who died at the institution in Tuam are believed to have been dumped into a former sewage tank, known as \"the pit\", according to local historian Catherine Corless. It was her painstaking research that uncovered the deaths of 798 children at the home for unmarried mothers between 1925 and its closure in 1961. Of those, just two were buried in a nearby cemetery. The remaining 796 are, it's presumed, buried at the site. \"I'm feeling very relieved,\" the historian told Sky News as the excavation begins. \"It's been a long, long journey. Not knowing what's going to happen, if it's just going to fall apart or if it's really going to happen.\" Ms Corless's findings in 2014 shocked Ireland and made headlines around the world. \n                  Man dead and child injured after shooting incident at shopping centre in Ireland\n                 \n                  Donegal: Tributes paid to two teenagers who died after getting into difficulty off the coast\n                 \n                  Tributes paid to 13-year-old girl Lauren O'Brien killed in motorsport racing crash in County Cork\n                 It exposed the dark underbelly of a mid-century Ireland heavily swayed by Catholicism and its cruel attitudes towards illegitimate children and the women who bore them, often sent to mother and baby homes before being separated from their offspring. A decade later, a team of investigators led by Daniel MacSweeney is embarking on a forensic excavation that could last for two years. The goal is to identify as many of the remains as possible through DNA testing, and to give all a dignified reburial. It's a glimmer of hope for people like Annette McKay, who now lives in Manchester. Her mother Margaret \"Maggie\" O'Connor gave birth to a baby girl in the Tuam home in 1942 after being raped at 17. The girl, named Mary Margaret, died six months later. Annette remembers her late mother recalling how \"she was pegging washing out and a nun came up behind her and said 'the child of your sin is dead'.\" Annette now hopes her infant sister's remains can be exhumed at Tuam and laid to rest with Maggie. Margaret O'Connor reunited with her child. \"I don't care if it's a thimbleful, as they tell me there wouldn't be much remains left; at six months old, it's mainly cartilage more than bone. I don't care if it's a thimbleful for me to be able to pop Mary Margaret with Maggie. That's fitting.\" For Annette, now 71, Tuam is emblematic of a different time in Ireland. \"We locked up victims of rape, we locked up victims of incest, we locked up victims of violence, we put them in laundries, we took their children, and we just handed them over to the Church to do what they wanted,\" she said. \"My mother worked heavily pregnant, cleaning floors and a nun passing kicked my mother in the stomach. And when that place is opened, their dirty, ugly secret, it isn't a secret anymore. \"It's out there. And we need to know from that dirty, ugly place what happened there. So first and foremost, we want answers to that place.\" Read more from Sky News:UK advises against all travel to IsraelAnti-tourism protests break out in Spain, Italy and PortugalControversial FIFA Club World Cup begins The Irish government made a formal state apology in 2021 after an inquiry found an \"appalling level of infant mortality\" in Ireland's mother and baby homes, concluding that around 9,000 children had died in the 18 institutions investigated. Taoiseach Micheal Martin said at the time that \"we had a completely warped attitude to sexuality and intimacy, and young mothers and their sons and daughters were forced to pay a terrible price for that dysfunction\". The Sisters of Bon Secours, which had run the Tuam home, offered their \"profound apologies\", admitting the children were \"buried in a disrespectful and unacceptable way\", and offered financial compensation.  As the dig - which could last up to two years - starts at the Bon Secours site, the people of Tuam are still grappling with the contempt and neglect that occurred in their town. \"I'm still trying to figure that out,\" said Ms Corless. \"I mean, these were a nursing congregation. \"The church preached to look after the vulnerable, the old and the orphaned, but they never included illegitimate children for some reason or another in their own psyche. \"I never, ever understand how they could do that to little babies, little toddlers. Beautiful little vulnerable children.\""

Speaking last night en route to the G7 summit in Canada, the prime minister said the conference is an opportunity to have a broad conversation with allies about global security in a \"constructive way\". His comments come as efforts by the US president to bring Russia and Ukraine to the table for peace negotiations continue to fail, while the UK government and European allies continue to plan for a \"coalition of the willing\" to enforce any peace deal. The prime minister is currently in Canada to attend the G7 summit - the annual meeting of Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the US, and the UK, as well as the EU.  Speaking to journalists on the plane, Sir Keir was asked if he expects additional sanctions on Russia to be agreed by allies.

That's not been really straightforward. \"But we do need to be clear about we need to get to the table, and that if that doesn't happen, sanctions will undoubtedly be part of the discussion at the G7.\"  Sir Keir added that he has a \"good relationship with President Trump\", which is \"important\" amid ongoing conflicts, such as between Israel and Iran. \"I think the G7 is our opportunity to look at, as we are, the global economy, security in that global economy, trade and the economy as well, and more matters of national security,\" he said.\"I've been saying, for probably the best part of six months now - we're in a new era of defence and security, a new error for trade and the economy. \"And I think it's really important for Britain to play a leading part in that, and that's what I'll be doing at the G7, talking to all of our partners in a constructive way.\" Mr Trump returned to the White House in January with a pledge to rapidly end the war in Ukraine. After President Zelenskyy had a blazing row with the US president in the Oval Office, Sir Keir accelerated his plan for a \"coalition of the willing\" - countries that would be prepared to provide troops or other means to ensure any eventual peace deal with Russia. But talks between the US and Russia on moving towards any kind of ceasefire have yet to bear fruit, and attacks on Ukrainian cities continue."

        "Content": "A nationwide police operation to track down those in grooming gangs has been announced by the Home Office. The National Crime Agency (NCA) will target those who have sexually exploited children as part of a grooming gang, and will investigate cases that were not previously progressed. Home Secretary Yvette Cooper said in a statement: \"The vulnerable young girls who suffered unimaginable abuse at the hands of groups of adult men have now grown into brave women who are rightly demanding justice for what they went through when they were just children. \"Not enough people listened to them then. That was wrong and unforgivable. We are changing that now. \"More than 800 grooming gang cases have already been identified by police after I asked them to look again at cases which had closed too early. \"Now we are asking the National Crime Agency to lead a major nationwide operation to track down more perpetrators and bring them to justice.\"  The NCA will work in partnership with police forces around the country and specialist officers from the Child Sexual Exploitation Taskforce, Operation Hydrant - which supports police forces to address all complex and high-profile cases of child sexual abuse - and the Tackling Organised Exploitation Programme. It comes after Sir Keir Starmer announced a national inquiry into child sex abuse on Saturday, ahead of the release of a government-requested audit into the scale of grooming gangs across the country, which concluded a nationwide probe was necessary. The prime minister previously argued a national inquiry was not necessary, but changed his view following an audit into group-based child sexual abuse led by Baroness Casey, set to be published next week. Ms Cooper is set to address parliament on Monday about the findings of the near 200-page report, which is expected to warn that white British girls were \"institutionally ignored for fear of racism\". One person familiar with the report said it details the institutional failures in treating young girls and cites a decade of lost action from the Independent Inquiry into Child Sexual Abuse (IICSA), set up in 2014 to investigate grooming gangs in Rotherham. The report is also expected to link illegal immigration with the exploitation of young girls.

        "Content": "\n          Wales reporter\n              @TomosGruffydd\n  The cost of rural crime in Wales is at its highest in more than a decade, a new report has revealed. Last year, rural crime cost an estimated Â£2.8m in Wales, according to insurance provider NFU Mutual. That's an 18% increase on the previous year, with Wales the only UK nation to have seen a rise. For farmers like Caryl Davies, that makes their work harder. The 21-year-old farms on a beef and sheep farm in Pembrokeshire. She told Sky News that having the quad bike stolen from her family farm last August had made them feel \"really unsafe at home\". The fact it happened in such a rural area was a \"really big shock\" for Ms Davies and her family. \n                  Essex set to be the home of Europe's largest low-carbon horticulture site\n                 \n                  Prince William meets Clarkson's Farm star to discuss challenges the industry is facing\n                 \n                  Bird flu detected in sheep in England for the first time\n                 \"We'd rely on the bike day in day out, to look after our cows and sheep, and it's had a really negative impact on us,\" she said. The cost of replacing a bike exactly like theirs would be \"close to Â£10,000\". \"They're a really expensive piece of kit, but you can't be without them, especially in these rural areas where we've got the mountain and maybe places that aren't very accessible,\" she added. \"The bike is totally crucial for our day-to-day running of the farm.\" The incident was caught on camera in the calving shed, but the Davies family have since invested in an enhanced CCTV system. That comes at an additional cost. \"For some farmers, this is spare money that we haven't really got,\" Ms Davies added. \"Farming is hard enough as it is, without people stealing your things and having to spend this extra money on making your home farm safe.\" The total cost of rural crime across the UK has fallen since 2023 - down from Â£52.8m to Â£44.1m. Quad bike and All Terrain Vehicles (ATVs) remained the top target for thieves during the past year, NFU Mutual's figures show. James Bourne farms in Pontypool, Torfaen, and claims to have had over 200 sheep stolen from common land adjoining his farm over a four-year period. The 32-year-old told Sky News that losing sheep from his herd was a \"big hit\" on his business as well as the young family he is trying to support. \"The way agriculture is at the moment anyway, we're struggling to make ends meet, and any profit that is in it is obviously being taken from me,\" he said. \"So I really need to try and find out and get to the bottom of where they're going because obviously it's an ongoing issue.\" Andrew Chalk, from NFU Mutual, told Sky News that while there had been a \"significant drop\" across the UK, there were \"worrying signs\". \"In Wales, especially, rural crime's gone up which just shows that organised criminals are looking for ways to target the countryside again and again,\" he said. \"What we've found increasingly is that organised criminals are targeting certain areas of the countryside, so they're hitting multiple farms in one night. \"They're raiding them, they're moving away to another area and then hitting multiple farms there. So it is hugely concerning.\" Mr Chalk said NFU Mutual had also heard reports of criminals using drones and other equipment to \"look at the lay of the land\". \"What it does show is that organised criminals are always going to find new ways to target rural crime and that's why we need to be on top of it and to work together to actually disrupt them,\" he added. Police forces in Wales say they are aware of the \"significant impact\" that rural crimes have on those affected. A Dyfed-Powys Police spokesperson said the force had acquired new technology to help combat rural crime, including \"advanced DNA asset-marking kits\" and hopes to \"empower farmers with effective tools and advice\".

Temporary Chief Superintendent Jason White, from Gwent Police, said the force would be \"increasing resources\" within the rural crime team throughout this financial year and urged anyone in a rural area who believes they have been a victim of crime to get in touch."

        "Content": "A nationwide police operation to track down those in grooming gangs has been announced by the Home Office. The National Crime Agency (NCA) will target those who have sexually exploited children as part of a grooming gang, and will investigate cases that were not previously progressed. Home Secretary Yvette Cooper said in a statement: \"The vulnerable young girls who suffered unimaginable abuse at the hands of groups of adult men have now grown into brave women who are rightly demanding justice for what they went through when they were just children. \"Not enough people listened to them then. That was wrong and unforgivable. We are changing that now. \"More than 800 grooming gang cases have already been identified by police after I asked them to look again at cases which had closed too early. \"Now we are asking the National Crime Agency to lead a major nationwide operation to track down more perpetrators and bring them to justice.\"  The NCA will work in partnership with police forces around the country and specialist officers from the Child Sexual Exploitation Taskforce, Operation Hydrant - which supports police forces to address all complex and high-profile cases of child sexual abuse - and the Tackling Organised Exploitation Programme. It comes after Sir Keir Starmer announced a national inquiry into child sex abuse on Saturday, ahead of the release of a government-requested audit into the scale of grooming gangs across the country, which concluded a nationwide probe was necessary. The prime minister previously argued a national inquiry was not necessary, but changed his view following an audit into group-based child sexual abuse led by Baroness Casey, set to be published next week. Ms Cooper is set to address parliament on Monday about the findings of the near 200-page report, which is expected to warn that white British girls were \"institutionally ignored for fear of racism\". One person familiar with the report said it details the institutional failures in treating young girls and cites a decade of lost action from the Independent Inquiry into Child Sexual Abuse (IICSA), set up in 2014 to investigate grooming gangs in Rotherham. The report is also expected to link illegal immigration with the exploitation of young girls.

        "Content": "\n          Wales reporter\n              @TomosGruffydd\n  The cost of rural crime in Wales is at its highest in more than a decade, a new report has revealed. Last year, rural crime cost an estimated Â£2.8m in Wales, according to insurance provider NFU Mutual. That's an 18% increase on the previous year, with Wales the only UK nation to have seen a rise. For farmers like Caryl Davies, that makes their work harder. The 21-year-old farms on a beef and sheep farm in Pembrokeshire. She told Sky News that having the quad bike stolen from her family farm last August had made them feel \"really unsafe at home\". The fact it happened in such a rural area was a \"really big shock\" for Ms Davies and her family. \n                  Essex set to be the home of Europe's largest low-carbon horticulture site\n                 \n                  Prince William meets Clarkson's Farm star to discuss challenges the industry is facing\n                 \n                  Bird flu detected in sheep in England for the first time\n                 \"We'd rely on the bike day in day out, to look after our cows and sheep, and it's had a really negative impact on us,\" she said. The cost of replacing a bike exactly like theirs would be \"close to Â£10,000\". \"They're a really expensive piece of kit, but you can't be without them, especially in these rural areas where we've got the mountain and maybe places that aren't very accessible,\" she added. \"The bike is totally crucial for our day-to-day running of the farm.\" The incident was caught on camera in the calving shed, but the Davies family have since invested in an enhanced CCTV system. That comes at an additional cost. \"For some farmers, this is spare money that we haven't really got,\" Ms Davies added. \"Farming is hard enough as it is, without people stealing your things and having to spend this extra money on making your home farm safe.\" The total cost of rural crime across the UK has fallen since 2023 - down from Â£52.8m to Â£44.1m. Quad bike and All Terrain Vehicles (ATVs) remained the top target for thieves during the past year, NFU Mutual's figures show. James Bourne farms in Pontypool, Torfaen, and claims to have had over 200 sheep stolen from common land adjoining his farm over a four-year period. The 32-year-old told Sky News that losing sheep from his herd was a \"big hit\" on his business as well as the young family he is trying to support. \"The way agriculture is at the moment anyway, we're struggling to make ends meet, and any profit that is in it is obviously being taken from me,\" he said. \"So I really need to try and find out and get to the bottom of where they're going because obviously it's an ongoing issue.\" Andrew Chalk, from NFU Mutual, told Sky News that while there had been a \"significant drop\" across the UK, there were \"worrying signs\". \"In Wales, especially, rural crime's gone up which just shows that organised criminals are looking for ways to target the countryside again and again,\" he said. \"What we've found increasingly is that organised criminals are targeting certain areas of the countryside, so they're hitting multiple farms in one night. \"They're raiding them, they're moving away to another area and then hitting multiple farms there. So it is hugely concerning.\" Mr Chalk said NFU Mutual had also heard reports of criminals using drones and other equipment to \"look at the lay of the land\". \"What it does show is that organised criminals are always going to find new ways to target rural crime and that's why we need to be on top of it and to work together to actually disrupt them,\" he added. Police forces in Wales say they are aware of the \"significant impact\" that rural crimes have on those affected. A Dyfed-Powys Police spokesperson said the force had acquired new technology to help combat rural crime, including \"advanced DNA asset-marking kits\" and hopes to \"empower farmers with effective tools and advice\".

Temporary Chief Superintendent Jason White, from Gwent Police, said the force would be \"increasing resources\" within the rural crime team throughout this financial year and urged anyone in a rural area who believes they have been a victim of crime to get in touch."

She will take over from Sir Richard Moore as the 18th Chief, also known as \"C\", when he steps down in the autumn. \"The historic appointment of Blaise Metreweli comes at a time when the work of our intelligence services has never been more vital,\" Sir Keir Starmer said in a statement released on Sunday night. \"The United Kingdom is facing threats on an unprecedented scale - be it aggressors who send their spy ships to our waters or hackers whose sophisticated cyber plots seek to disrupt our public services.\"  Of the other main spy agencies, GCHQ is also under female command for the first time. Anne Keast-Butler took on the role in 2023, while MI5 has previously twice been led by a woman. Until now, a female spy chief had only headed MI6 - also known as the Secret Intelligence Service (SIS) - in the James Bond movies. Dame Judi Dench held the fictional role - called \"M\" in the films instead of \"C\" - between 1995 and 2015. Ms Metreweli currently serves as \"Q\", one of four director generals inside MI6. The position - also made famous by the James Bond films, with the fictional \"Q\" producing an array of spy gadgets - means she is responsible for technology and innovation. Ms Metreweli, a Cambridge graduate, joined MI6 in 1999. Unlike the outgoing chief, who spent some of his service as a regular diplomat in the foreign office, including as ambassador to Turkey, she has spent her entire career as an intelligence officer. Much of that time was dedicated to operational roles in the Middle East and Europe. Ms Metreweli, who is highly regarded by colleagues, also worked as a director at MI5.

        "Content": " The chancellor has refused to say if the government will apologise for dismissing calls for a national public inquiry into grooming gangs after the prime minister U-turned on the matter last night. Rachel Reeves told Sky News Sir Keir Starmer changed his mind after a government-requested audit into the scale of grooming gangs across the country concluded a nationwide probe was necessary. But she said the most important thing is to focus on the victims, not the \"hurt feelings\" of how others may have been spoken about. Politics Hub: Tap here for live updates  Speaking to Sky's Sunday Morning With Trevor Phillips, Ms Reeves said one of the reasons the prime minister changed his mind on the need for a statutory public inquiry is to ensure that \"people are compelled to give evidence\", which local inquiries do not have the power to do. The chancellor was then asked if there will be an apology to people who were criticised by ministers for \"talking total nonsense\", spreading \"misinformation\", and were accused of jumping on an extremist \"bandwagon\". She replied: \"What is the most important thing here? It is the victims, and it's not people's hurt feelings about how they have been spoken about.\"  What has the PM previously said? The prime minister has been sharply criticised for his comments about people calling for a statutory public inquiry. He said on 6 January: \"What I won't tolerate is this discussion and debate based on lies without calling it out. What I won't tolerate is politicians jumping on the bandwagon simply to get attention. \"When those politicians sat in government for 14 long years tweeting, talking, but not doing anything about [it]. Now, so desperate for attention that they're amplifying what the far right is saying.\" But Ms Reeves defended the prime minister's handling of the issue, saying he pledged to implement all 20 recommendations from the Independent Inquiry into Child Sexual Abuse (IICSA), criminal convictions are now at \"a record high\", and that he brought the first convictions for grooming when he served as director of public prosecutions.  PM explains his U-turn Sir Keir confirmed last night that he will now be ordering a full statutory inquiry into the grooming gangs scandal. The full report from Baroness Louise Casey is set to be published on Monday, and the home secretary is expected to make a statement to parliament. He told reporters travelling with him to the G7 summit in Canada: \"[Baroness Casey's] position when she started the audit was that there was not a real need for a national inquiry over and above what was going on. \"She has looked at the material... and she has come to the view that there should be a national inquiry on the basis of what she has seen. I have read every single word of her report, and I am going to accept her recommendation. That is the right thing to do on the basis of what she has put in her audit. \"I asked her to do that job to double check on this; she has done that job for me, and having read her report... I shall now implement her recommendations.\" What will the report say? The near 200-page report is to be published next week and is expected to warn that white British girls were \"institutionally ignored for fear of racism\". One person familiar with the report said it details the institutional failures in treating young girls and cites a decade of lost action from the IICSA, set up in 2014 to investigate grooming gangs in Rotherham. The report is also expected to link illegal immigration with the exploitation of young girls.

        "Content": "Liam Gallagher has criticised a Scottish council for suggesting Oasis fans were \"drunk, middle-aged and fat\". The remarks were revealed following a freedom of information request that was sent to Edinburgh council - ahead of the band's three sold-out shows in Scotland this August. The documents expressed concerns that the Oasis Live '25 tour would clash with the Edinburgh Festival Fringe - the world's largest performance arts festival.   One note warned that there would be a \"substantial amount of older fans\", and that because \"middle-aged men take up more room\", age and size should be considered in crowd control planning. Another note suggested \"medium to high intoxication\" should be expected at the concert. An additional remark said there was some \"concern about crowds of Oasis on weekends as they are already rowdy, and the tone of the band\". It also expressed concern for the \"safety\" at the Edinburgh Fringe - including for its performers. \"Many performers are considering not attending for that weekend,\" one note read. Liam Gallagher was not impressed - and left the following message for the council on his social media. \"To the Edinburgh council I've heard what you said about Oasis fans and quite frankly your attitude f****** stinks I'd leave town that day if I was any of you lot.\" In a second post, he said: \"I'd love to see a picture of all the people on the Edinburgh council bet there's some real stunning individuals.\" David Walker, from the Oasis Collectors Group, has described the comments as \"a nasty, sneering stereotype\". \"It's a jaundiced view,\" he added. Local councillor Margaret Graham said that it is usual practice for the council to \"prepare extensively\" for major city events. The culture and communities convener also said: \"We're very proud to host the biggest and best events in Edinburgh throughout the year, which bring in hundreds of millions of pounds to the local economy and provide unparalleled entertainment for our residents and visitors. \"As with any major event which takes place in the city, we prepare extensively alongside our partners to ensure the safety and best possible experience of everyone involved - and Oasis are no different.\" Around 210,000 fans are expected to attend the three Edinburgh gigs. Oasis made their comeback announcement in August last year - ahead of the 30th anniversary of their debut album Definitely Maybe, released on 29 August 1994.

Liam damaged one of his elder brother's guitars, causing Noel to dramatically quit - ending the partnership that had propelled them to fame and fortune. \"It is with some sadness and great relief... I quit Oasis tonight,\" Noel later said in a statement. \"People will write and say what they like, but I simply could not go on working with Liam a day longer.\" The feud continued over the years, with the pair exchanging insults publicly - Liam on social media, Noel more when asked about his brother in interviews - but reportedly never speaking in person. When his documentary As It Was was released in 2019, Liam told Sky News he had wanted to \"break [Noel's] jaw\" after he apparently refused permission for Oasis music to be featured in the film. But after 15 years, they have now made amends - giving thousands of Oasis fans the chance to see them play live once again. Their top hits include Wonderwall, Don't Look Back In Anger, Stand By Me, Lyla and The Importance of Being Idle."

On Friday, the Foreign Office warned against \"all but essential travel\" to most of Israel.

But the government has now updated the warning for the remainder of the country to red. Follow live: Tehran and Israel exchange strikes This puts Israel on the same level as Iran, and the change of advice is also likely to impact travel insurance. However, with Israel's airspace closed, it is unlikely many people will be attempting the journey, and Israel's national airline El Al has announced it is cancelling flights to and from many European cities, as well as Tokyo and Moscow, until 23 June. The change in travel advice comes after a second night of ballistic missile barrages from Iran following Israel's attack in the early hours of Friday morning.  On Sunday morning, Israel's health ministry said 12 people had been killed over the past day, taking the total since Friday to 15. It also said 385 people had arrived at hospital with injuries overnight. Iran has not provided a total number of deaths or overall casualties, but has claimed dozens have been killed. Iran's health minister has said most of those injured and killed in Israeli strikes were civilians. According to comments carried by news agency IRNA, he said the majority were women and children.

        "Content": "By Dylan Donnelly, news reporter   Protesters in Spain, Italy and Portugal are calling for a curb on mass tourism - with Barcelona organisers telling demonstrators to bring water pistols to shoot at holidaymakers. Campaigners say excessive levels of tourism are forcing locals out of affordable housing, raising the cost of living and making the city centres unusable. The latest in a growing number of protests in recent years, anti-mass tourism demonstrations were planned in Barcelona as well as in seven other Spanish cities, including Granada, Palma and Ibiza. Protests were also seen in the Portuguese capital Lisbon, as well as in Italian hotspots Venice, Genova, Palermo, Milan and Naples, according to announcements issued by several of the organising groups.  It comes after Sky News reported on makeshift camps on the island of Ibiza, where dozens live with no electricity, water or waste services. The Menys Turisme Mes Vida (Less Tourism More Life) campaign group had told us: \"We say enough to the destruction of the territory, to the precariousness, to the housing crisis, to the loss of rights.\"  Carmen Naranjo, a 21-year-old student from Barcelona, told Sky News that some tourists see the Catalonian city as \"an amusement park\". \"With the rise of social media and Airbnbs, it seems like we have given up our traditions, festivities, local spots and so on in favour of mass tourism that does not properly engage with Spanish and Catalan culture and our small local businesses,\" she said. \"People come and see it as an amusement park, to the point where they have had to close some some landmarks that locals enjoyed going to because of overcrowding.\" \"It is not fair for the people of Barcelona to have to endure precarious salaries in hospitality in order to serve mass tourism that stays in these short-term rental apartments, pushing people out of the neighbourhoods we grew up in, as we cannot afford housing anymore.\" Daniel Pardo, one of the organisers of the Barcelona protest, told the Associated Press: \"It is very likely the water pistols will be back. \"In fact, we encourage people to bring their own.\" Txema Escorsa, who lives in a two-bedroom apartment in Barcelona's residential GrÃ cia neighbourhood, also told the news agency: \"It is tough for me to imagine what to do next. \"If I leave, will I be contributing to Barcelona losing its essence that comes from its locals? But there comes a time when I'm fed up.\" He added that he has stopped using Airbnb when travelling, saying that \"in the end, you realise that this is taking away housing from people\". Jaime Rodriguez de Santiago, Airbnb's general director for Spain and Portugal, said that \"a lot of our politicians have found an easy scapegoat to blame for the inefficiencies of their policies in terms of housing and tourism over the last 10, 15, 20 years\". \"If you look at the over-tourism problem in Spain, it has been brewing for decades, and probably since the 60s,\" he added. Mr RodrÃ­guez de Santiago noted that hotels are still the leading accommodation for tourists - with hotels in Barcelona accounting for 20 million tourists in 2024, compared with 12 million who used homes, according to local data. He also pointed out Barcelona's mayor Jaume Collboni backing the expansion of the city's international airport.

According to studies cited by its economy minister, the country could see as many as 100 million tourists this year."

        "Content": "\n          Ireland correspondent\n              @SMurphyTV\n A long-awaited forensic excavation at a former 'mother and baby home', where the remains of almost 800 babies and children are believed to be buried, will start today in County Galway. Many of the children who died at the institution in Tuam are believed to have been dumped into a former sewage tank, known as \"the pit\", according to local historian Catherine Corless. It was her painstaking research that uncovered the deaths of 798 children at the home for unmarried mothers between 1925 and its closure in 1961. Of those, just two were buried in a nearby cemetery. The remaining 796 are, it's presumed, buried at the site. \"I'm feeling very relieved,\" the historian told Sky News as the excavation begins. \"It's been a long, long journey. Not knowing what's going to happen, if it's just going to fall apart or if it's really going to happen.\" Ms Corless's findings in 2014 shocked Ireland and made headlines around the world. \n                  Man dead and child injured after shooting incident at shopping centre in Ireland\n                 \n                  Donegal: Tributes paid to two teenagers who died after getting into difficulty off the coast\n                 \n                  Tributes paid to 13-year-old girl Lauren O'Brien killed in motorsport racing crash in County Cork\n                 It exposed the dark underbelly of a mid-century Ireland heavily swayed by Catholicism and its cruel attitudes towards illegitimate children and the women who bore them, often sent to mother and baby homes before being separated from their offspring. A decade later, a team of investigators led by Daniel MacSweeney is embarking on a forensic excavation that could last for two years. The goal is to identify as many of the remains as possible through DNA testing, and to give all a dignified reburial. It's a glimmer of hope for people like Annette McKay, who now lives in Manchester. Her mother Margaret \"Maggie\" O'Connor gave birth to a baby girl in the Tuam home in 1942 after being raped at 17. The girl, named Mary Margaret, died six months later. Annette remembers her late mother recalling how \"she was pegging washing out and a nun came up behind her and said 'the child of your sin is dead'.\" Annette now hopes her infant sister's remains can be exhumed at Tuam and laid to rest with Maggie.

Taoiseach Micheal Martin said at the time that \"we had a completely warped attitude to sexuality and intimacy, and young mothers and their sons and daughters were forced to pay a terrible price for that dysfunction\". The Sisters of Bon Secours, which had run the Tuam home, offered their \"profound apologies\", admitting the children were \"buried in a disrespectful and unacceptable way\", and offered financial compensation.  As the dig - which could last up to two years - starts at the Bon Secours site, the people of Tuam are still grappling with the contempt and neglect that occurred in their town. \"I'm still trying to figure that out,\" said Ms Corless. \"I mean, these were a nursing congregation. \"The church preached to look after the vulnerable, the old and the orphaned, but they never included illegitimate children for some reason or another in their own psyche. \"I never, ever understand how they could do that to little babies, little toddlers.

        "Content": "G7 allies will discuss further sanctions on Russia if Vladimir Putin does not agree to negotiate a ceasefire in Ukraine, Sir Keir Starmer has said.  Speaking last night en route to the G7 summit in Canada, the prime minister said the conference is an opportunity to have a broad conversation with allies about global security in a \"constructive way\". His comments come as efforts by the US president to bring Russia and Ukraine to the table for peace negotiations continue to fail, while the UK government and European allies continue to plan for a \"coalition of the willing\" to enforce any peace deal. The prime minister is currently in Canada to attend the G7 summit - the annual meeting of Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the US, and the UK, as well as the EU.  Speaking to journalists on the plane, Sir Keir was asked if he expects additional sanctions on Russia to be agreed by allies. He replied: \"We've got President Zelenskyy coming, so that provides a good opportunity for us to discuss this again as a group.\" \n                  Washington parade celebrates US Army's 250th anniversary on Donald Trump's 79th birthday\n                 \n                  Trump and Putin agree Iran-Israel conflict 'should end' in hour-long phone call\n                 \n                  Trump's Iran remarks let him still play 'good cop' to Netanyahu's 'bad cop'\n                 He continued: \"My long-standing view is, we need to get Russia to the table for an unconditional ceasefire. That's not been really straightforward. \"But we do need to be clear about we need to get to the table, and that if that doesn't happen, sanctions will undoubtedly be part of the discussion at the G7.\"  Sir Keir added that he has a \"good relationship with President Trump\", which is \"important\" amid ongoing conflicts, such as between Israel and Iran. \"I think the G7 is our opportunity to look at, as we are, the global economy, security in that global economy, trade and the economy as well, and more matters of national security,\" he said.\"I've been saying, for probably the best part of six months now - we're in a new era of defence and security, a new error for trade and the economy. \"And I think it's really important for Britain to play a leading part in that, and that's what I'll be doing at the G7, talking to all of our partners in a constructive way.\" Mr Trump returned to the White House in January with a pledge to rapidly end the war in Ukraine. After President Zelenskyy had a blazing row with the US president in the Oval Office, Sir Keir accelerated his plan for a \"coalition of the willing\" - countries that would be prepared to provide troops or other means to ensure any eventual peace deal with Russia. But talks between the US and Russia on moving towards any kind of ceasefire have yet to bear fruit, and attacks on Ukrainian cities continue."

On Friday, the Foreign Office warned against \"all but essential travel\" to most of Israel. The areas around Gaza, the West Bank and the Golan Heights were already classed as red zones, with warnings to avoid travel to these areas. But the government has now updated the warning for the remainder of the country to red. Follow live: Tehran and Israel exchange strikes This puts Israel on the same level as Iran, and the change of advice is also likely to impact travel insurance. However, with Israel's airspace closed, it is unlikely many people will be attempting the journey, and Israel's national airline El Al has announced it is cancelling flights to and from many European cities, as well as Tokyo and Moscow, until 23 June. The change in travel advice comes after a second night of ballistic missile barrages from Iran following Israel's attack in the early hours of Friday morning.  On Sunday morning, Israel's health ministry said 12 people had been killed over the past day, taking the total since Friday to 15. It also said 385 people had arrived at hospital with injuries overnight. Iran has not provided a total number of deaths or overall casualties, but has claimed dozens have been killed. Iran's health minister has said most of those injured and killed in Israeli strikes were civilians. According to comments carried by news agency IRNA, he said the majority were women and children.

Speaking to Sky's Sunday Morning With Trevor Phillips, Rachel Reeves said sending military assets to the Middle East \"does not mean that we are at war\", and emphasised that \"we have not been involved in these strikes or this conflict\". \"But we do have important assets in the region,\" she continued. \"And it is right that we send jets to protect them. And that's what we've done. It's a precautionary move, and at the same time, we are urging de-escalation.\" Pushed on the question of what the UK would do if Israel asked for support with its operations, the chancellor replied: \"I'm not going to rule anything out at this stage. It's a fast-moving situation, a very volatile situation. But we don't want to see escalation.\""

The accident happened within minutes of the helicopter taking off, officials said, on what should have been a 10-minute flight. The helicopter was flying to Guptkashi, a prominent Hindu pilgrimage site in the Himalayas, from Kedarnath temple town in the northern Indian state of Uttarakhand. It comes three days after an Air India flight crashed less than a minute after taking off from Ahmedabad airport in northwestern India, killing at least 270 people. The helicopter, which was operated by private helicopter service Aryan Aviation, went down in a forested area several miles from the Kedarnath pilgrimage route at around 5.30am local time. Officials said the crash was believed to have been caused by poor weather conditions.

The bodies were badly burned in a fire that followed the crash, they said. Tens of thousands of pilgrims visit Kedarnath, which is home to one of the four most sacred Hindu temple shrines, each summer. Many use helicopter services due to the difficult mountainous terrain. Helicopter mishaps are not uncommon in the region, where sudden weather changes and high-altitude flying conditions can pose risks. Earlier this month, a helicopter operating in the Kedarnath Valley made an emergency landing shortly after taking off on a highway due to a technical fault. The pilot was injured but all five passengers on board were unharmed. In May, a helicopter crashed in Uttarkashi district, killing six people, including the pilot. One person survived."

Former state speaker Melissa Hortman and her husband Mark were gunned down in their own home in the early hours of Saturday.

His daughter was their babysitter. \"Very kind, very neighbourly, very intelligent,\" he recalls. Of Ms Hortman, he said: \"She would know other people that were on the other side of the aisle, but it didn't matter to her. \"Politics was never brought into the neighbourhood.\" Other neighbours remained behind closed doors, where they had initially been ordered to shelter following two gun attacks. Long-standing state senator John Hoffman and his wife Yvette had been shot and wounded in their home. Police officers sent to check on his Democratic colleague, Melissa Hortman, were too late. They encountered a man disguised as a police officer leaving her home and exchanged fire with him, but he escaped, sparking a manhunt. Minnesota governor Tim Walz, who ran for vice president last year, described the murders as \"politically motivated\". That's something the residents of this suburban network of streets find hard to comprehend. \"Nationally and stuff, things are very volatile in the political scene and I just pray that it's not here,\" John Sampson told me. \"I hoped it would never come anywhere near here, that anyone has to go through this type of tragedy.\" \"I feel very sad for the children and for the family left behind,\" he added.

        "Content": "A nationwide police operation to track down those in grooming gangs has been announced by the Home Office. The National Crime Agency (NCA) will target those who have sexually exploited children as part of a grooming gang, and will investigate cases that were not previously progressed. Home Secretary Yvette Cooper said in a statement: \"The vulnerable young girls who suffered unimaginable abuse at the hands of groups of adult men have now grown into brave women who are rightly demanding justice for what they went through when they were just children. \"Not enough people listened to them then. That was wrong and unforgivable. We are changing that now. \"More than 800 grooming gang cases have already been identified by police after I asked them to look again at cases which had closed too early. \"Now we are asking the National Crime Agency to lead a major nationwide operation to track down more perpetrators and bring them to justice.\"  The NCA will work in partnership with police forces around the country and specialist officers from the Child Sexual Exploitation Taskforce, Operation Hydrant - which supports police forces to address all complex and high-profile cases of child sexual abuse - and the Tackling Organised Exploitation Programme. It comes after Sir Keir Starmer announced a national inquiry into child sex abuse on Saturday, ahead of the release of a government-requested audit into the scale of grooming gangs across the country, which concluded a nationwide probe was necessary. The prime minister previously argued a national inquiry was not necessary, but changed his view following an audit into group-based child sexual abuse led by Baroness Casey, set to be published next week. Ms Cooper is set to address parliament on Monday about the findings of the near 200-page report, which is expected to warn that white British girls were \"institutionally ignored for fear of racism\". One person familiar with the report said it details the institutional failures in treating young girls and cites a decade of lost action from the Independent Inquiry into Child Sexual Abuse (IICSA), set up in 2014 to investigate grooming gangs in Rotherham. The report is also expected to link illegal immigration with the exploitation of young girls.

        "Content": "G7 allies will discuss further sanctions on Russia if Vladimir Putin does not agree to negotiate a ceasefire in Ukraine, Sir Keir Starmer has said.  Speaking last night en route to the G7 summit in Canada, the prime minister said the conference is an opportunity to have a broad conversation with allies about global security in a \"constructive way\". His comments come as efforts by the US president to bring Russia and Ukraine to the table for peace negotiations continue to fail, while the UK government and European allies continue to plan for a \"coalition of the willing\" to enforce any peace deal. The prime minister is currently in Canada to attend the G7 summit - the annual meeting of Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the US, and the UK, as well as the EU.  Speaking to journalists on the plane, Sir Keir was asked if he expects additional sanctions on Russia to be agreed by allies. He replied: \"We've got President Zelenskyy coming, so that provides a good opportunity for us to discuss this again as a group.\" \n                  Washington parade celebrates US Army's 250th anniversary on Donald Trump's 79th birthday\n                 \n                  Trump and Putin agree Iran-Israel conflict 'should end' in hour-long phone call\n                 \n                  Trump's Iran remarks let him still play 'good cop' to Netanyahu's 'bad cop'\n                 He continued: \"My long-standing view is, we need to get Russia to the table for an unconditional ceasefire. That's not been really straightforward. \"But we do need to be clear about we need to get to the table, and that if that doesn't happen, sanctions will undoubtedly be part of the discussion at the G7.\"  Sir Keir added that he has a \"good relationship with President Trump\", which is \"important\" amid ongoing conflicts, such as between Israel and Iran. \"I think the G7 is our opportunity to look at, as we are, the global economy, security in that global economy, trade and the economy as well, and more matters of national security,\" he said.\"I've been saying, for probably the best part of six months now - we're in a new era of defence and security, a new error for trade and the economy. \"And I think it's really important for Britain to play a leading part in that, and that's what I'll be doing at the G7, talking to all of our partners in a constructive way.\" Mr Trump returned to the White House in January with a pledge to rapidly end the war in Ukraine. After President Zelenskyy had a blazing row with the US president in the Oval Office, Sir Keir accelerated his plan for a \"coalition of the willing\" - countries that would be prepared to provide troops or other means to ensure any eventual peace deal with Russia. But talks between the US and Russia on moving towards any kind of ceasefire have yet to bear fruit, and attacks on Ukrainian cities continue."

She will take over from Sir Richard Moore as the 18th Chief, also known as \"C\", when he steps down in the autumn. \"The historic appointment of Blaise Metreweli comes at a time when the work of our intelligence services has never been more vital,\" Sir Keir Starmer said in a statement released on Sunday night. \"The United Kingdom is facing threats on an unprecedented scale - be it aggressors who send their spy ships to our waters or hackers whose sophisticated cyber plots seek to disrupt our public services.\"  Of the other main spy agencies, GCHQ is also under female command for the first time. Anne Keast-Butler took on the role in 2023, while MI5 has previously twice been led by a woman. Until now, a female spy chief had only headed MI6 - also known as the Secret Intelligence Service (SIS) - in the James Bond movies. Dame Judi Dench held the fictional role - called \"M\" in the films instead of \"C\" - between 1995 and 2015. Ms Metreweli currently serves as \"Q\", one of four director generals inside MI6. The position - also made famous by the James Bond films, with the fictional \"Q\" producing an array of spy gadgets - means she is responsible for technology and innovation. Ms Metreweli, a Cambridge graduate, joined MI6 in 1999. Unlike the outgoing chief, who spent some of his service as a regular diplomat in the foreign office, including as ambassador to Turkey, she has spent her entire career as an intelligence officer.

On Friday, the Foreign Office warned against \"all but essential travel\" to most of Israel. The areas around Gaza, the West Bank and the Golan Heights were already classed as red zones, with warnings to avoid travel to these areas. But the government has now updated the warning for the remainder of the country to red. Follow live: Tehran and Israel exchange strikes This puts Israel on the same level as Iran, and the change of advice is also likely to impact travel insurance. However, with Israel's airspace closed, it is unlikely many people will be attempting the journey, and Israel's national airline El Al has announced it is cancelling flights to and from many European cities, as well as Tokyo and Moscow, until 23 June. The change in travel advice comes after a second night of ballistic missile barrages from Iran following Israel's attack in the early hours of Friday morning.  On Sunday morning, Israel's health ministry said 12 people had been killed over the past day, taking the total since Friday to 15. It also said 385 people had arrived at hospital with injuries overnight. Iran has not provided a total number of deaths or overall casualties, but has claimed dozens have been killed.

        "Content": "\n          Political editor\n              @BethRigby\n The return of Donald Trump to the G7 was always going to be unpredictable. That it is happening against the backdrop of an escalating conflict in the Middle East makes it even more so. Expectations had already been low, with the Canadian hosts cautioning against the normal joint communique at the end of the summit, mindful that this group of leaders would struggle to find consensus.  Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney carefully laid down an agenda that was uncontroversial in a bid to avoid any blow-ups between President Trump and allies, who of late have been divided like never before - be it over tariffs and trade, Russia and Ukraine, or, more recently Israel's conduct in Gaza. But discussions around critical minerals and global supply chains will undoubtedly drop down the agenda as leaders convene at a precarious moment.  Sir Keir Starmer, on his way over to Canada for a bi-lateral meeting in Ottawa with Mr Carney before travelling on to the G7 summit in Kananaskis, underscored the gravity of the situation as he again spoke of de-escalation, while also confirming that the UK was deploying more British fighter jets to the region amid threats from Tehran that it will attack UK bases if London helps defend Israel against airstrikes. Really this is a G7 agenda scrambled as world leaders race to de-escalate the worst fighting between Tel Aviv and Tehran in decades. Trump has for months been urging Israel not to strike Iran as he worked towards a diplomatic deal to halt uranium enrichment. Further talks had been due on Sunday - but are now not expected to go ahead. All eyes will be on Trump in the coming days, to see if the US - Israel's closest ally - will call on Israel to rein in its assault. The US has so far not participated in any joint attacks with Tel Aviv, but is moving warships and other military assets to the Middle East. \n                  G7 leaders' summit in Japan stands out as memorable - and not just because Zelenskyy jetted in \n                 \n                  Zelenskyy meets Sunak at G7 in Japan as US approves sending F-16 fighter jets to Ukraine\n                 Sir Keir, who has managed to strike the first trade deal with Trump, will want to leverage his \"good relationship\" with the US leader at the G7 to press for de-escalation in the Middle East, while he also hopes to use the summit to further discuss the further the interests of Ukraine with Trump and raise again the prospects of Russian sanctions. \"We've got President Zelenskyy coming so that provides a good opportunity for us to discuss again as a group,\" the PM told me on the flight over to Canada. \"My long-standing view is, we need to get Russia to the table for an unconditional ceasefire. That's not been really straightforward. But we do need to be clear about what we need to get to the table and that if that doesn't happen, sanctions will undoubtedly be part of the discussion at the G7.\" But that the leaders are not planning for a joint communique - a document outlining what the leaders have agreed - tells you a lot. When they last gathered with Trump in Canada for the G7 back in 2018, the US president rather spectacularly fell out with Justin Trudeau when the former Canadian president threatened to retaliate against US tariffs and refused to sign the G7 agreement.

With so much disagreement between the US and allies, it is hard to see where progress might be made over the next couple of days. But what these leaders will agree on is the need to take down the temperature in the Middle East and for all the unpredictability around these relationships, what is certain is a sense of urgency around Iran and Israel that could find these increasingly disparate allies on common ground."

Rachel Reeves told Sky News Sir Keir Starmer changed his mind after a government-requested audit into the scale of grooming gangs across the country concluded a nationwide probe was necessary. But she said the most important thing is to focus on the victims, not the \"hurt feelings\" of how others may have been spoken about. Politics Hub: Tap here for live updates  Speaking to Sky's Sunday Morning With Trevor Phillips, Ms Reeves said one of the reasons the prime minister changed his mind on the need for a statutory public inquiry is to ensure that \"people are compelled to give evidence\", which local inquiries do not have the power to do. The chancellor was then asked if there will be an apology to people who were criticised by ministers for \"talking total nonsense\", spreading \"misinformation\", and were accused of jumping on an extremist \"bandwagon\". She replied: \"What is the most important thing here? It is the victims, and it's not people's hurt feelings about how they have been spoken about.\"  What has the PM previously said? The prime minister has been sharply criticised for his comments about people calling for a statutory public inquiry. He said on 6 January: \"What I won't tolerate is this discussion and debate based on lies without calling it out. What I won't tolerate is politicians jumping on the bandwagon simply to get attention. \"When those politicians sat in government for 14 long years tweeting, talking, but not doing anything about [it]. Now, so desperate for attention that they're amplifying what the far right is saying.\" But Ms Reeves defended the prime minister's handling of the issue, saying he pledged to implement all 20 recommendations from the Independent Inquiry into Child Sexual Abuse (IICSA), criminal convictions are now at \"a record high\", and that he brought the first convictions for grooming when he served as director of public prosecutions.  PM explains his U-turn Sir Keir confirmed last night that he will now be ordering a full statutory inquiry into the grooming gangs scandal. The full report from Baroness Louise Casey is set to be published on Monday, and the home secretary is expected to make a statement to parliament. He told reporters travelling with him to the G7 summit in Canada: \"[Baroness Casey's] position when she started the audit was that there was not a real need for a national inquiry over and above what was going on. \"She has looked at the material... and she has come to the view that there should be a national inquiry on the basis of what she has seen. I have read every single word of her report, and I am going to accept her recommendation. That is the right thing to do on the basis of what she has put in her audit. \"I asked her to do that job to double check on this; she has done that job for me, and having read her report... I shall now implement her recommendations.\" What will the report say? The near 200-page report is to be published next week and is expected to warn that white British girls were \"institutionally ignored for fear of racism\". One person familiar with the report said it details the institutional failures in treating young girls and cites a decade of lost action from the IICSA, set up in 2014 to investigate grooming gangs in Rotherham. The report is also expected to link illegal immigration with the exploitation of young girls.

        "Content": "\n          Science correspondent\n              @SkyNewsThomas\n  Octopuses, sharks and tuna that are booming in the sea around the UK could be part of a fundamental shift in the marine environment, a leading scientist has told Sky News. Dr Simon Thomas, from the Marine Biological Association in Plymouth, said a perfect storm of factors, including climate change and overfishing, is leading to a rapid change in the species being found around the coast. \"Since 2016, you've seen a lot of our traditional fish, like cod, ling and pollock decreasing in numbers and pushing northwards,\" he said. \"Then we've seen other fish, especially things like bluefin tuna and blue sharks, being found in huge numbers in the water here. \"It's almost like you've seen a complete shift in the regime of the ocean.\" 'I've never seen anything like it' Fishermen on the south coast of Devon and Cornwall are currently catching huge numbers of a large octopus species that is normally rare in the UK. \n                  Could Britain face a winter ice age? How temperatures could one day plummet due to climate change\n                 \n                  UK backs UN treaty to stop oceans becoming the 'wild west'\n                 \n                  Prince William warns world's oceans are 'diminishing before our eyes' in call for urgent action\n                 \"I've never seen anything like it in my lifetime,\" said Dr Thomas. \"I've spent 40 years at sea and probably seen three or four of the big octopus over the years. Now they are seen regularly and (crab fishermen) are reporting their pots have been decimated.\" The octopuses are raiding crab and lobster pots for an easy meal. But there are so many of them, and they are so hungry, that fishermen say they are eating not only the bait and crustaceans, but also, at times, each other. Sam Jago, skipper of the Bosloe, returned to Plymouth after a day's fishing with 11 crates of octopuses - a 400kg bonanza that could fetch almost Â£3,000 at market rates. But he had just over one tub of crabs and lobsters - when normally he'd have more than a dozen. \"They crack the shell and suck everything out of it,\" he said. \"It's a quick buck at the moment, but who knows how long it's going to last for. \"They will stay here until they've eaten everything. \"But if the octopus go, the crab isn't going to just appear out of thin air. \"We won't have a great deal to catch.\" Read more from Sky News:Trooping the Colour - see best picsIs Ibiza at breaking point?Why is Ballymena the site of riots? The Marine Biological Association is studying factors that could underpin the surge in octopus numbers. The sea around the UK is around 2C warmer than normal. But in the southwest of England the temperature is 3C or even 4C above average for the time of year. Dr Thomas said warmer waters increase survival of young octopus fry over winter, and a change to ocean currents could bring them more food. 'The ocean is changing' Overfishing of species that would normally eat young octopuses may also mean more are surviving to adulthood. \"There is no doubt that the ocean is changing,\" he said. \"Fishermen are like the canaries in the coal mine, the first to see things changing out at sea.\" Scientists say protecting key parts of the ocean as marine nature reserves would serve as a buffer against pressures from human activity elsewhere. So far, 50 nations plus the EU have ratified the United Nations High Seas Treaty that commits countries to protect 30% of the ocean by 2030. Another nine need to ratify it for it to become operational. The UK government has said it will ratify the treaty by the end of the year."

        "Content": "Liam Gallagher has criticised a Scottish council for suggesting Oasis fans were \"drunk, middle-aged and fat\". The remarks were revealed following a freedom of information request that was sent to Edinburgh council - ahead of the band's three sold-out shows in Scotland this August. The documents expressed concerns that the Oasis Live '25 tour would clash with the Edinburgh Festival Fringe - the world's largest performance arts festival.   One note warned that there would be a \"substantial amount of older fans\", and that because \"middle-aged men take up more room\", age and size should be considered in crowd control planning. Another note suggested \"medium to high intoxication\" should be expected at the concert. An additional remark said there was some \"concern about crowds of Oasis on weekends as they are already rowdy, and the tone of the band\". It also expressed concern for the \"safety\" at the Edinburgh Fringe - including for its performers. \"Many performers are considering not attending for that weekend,\" one note read. Liam Gallagher was not impressed - and left the following message for the council on his social media. \"To the Edinburgh council I've heard what you said about Oasis fans and quite frankly your attitude f****** stinks I'd leave town that day if I was any of you lot.\" In a second post, he said: \"I'd love to see a picture of all the people on the Edinburgh council bet there's some real stunning individuals.\" David Walker, from the Oasis Collectors Group, has described the comments as \"a nasty, sneering stereotype\". \"It's a jaundiced view,\" he added. Local councillor Margaret Graham said that it is usual practice for the council to \"prepare extensively\" for major city events. The culture and communities convener also said: \"We're very proud to host the biggest and best events in Edinburgh throughout the year, which bring in hundreds of millions of pounds to the local economy and provide unparalleled entertainment for our residents and visitors. \"As with any major event which takes place in the city, we prepare extensively alongside our partners to ensure the safety and best possible experience of everyone involved - and Oasis are no different.\" Around 210,000 fans are expected to attend the three Edinburgh gigs. Oasis made their comeback announcement in August last year - ahead of the 30th anniversary of their debut album Definitely Maybe, released on 29 August 1994.

Liam damaged one of his elder brother's guitars, causing Noel to dramatically quit - ending the partnership that had propelled them to fame and fortune. \"It is with some sadness and great relief... I quit Oasis tonight,\" Noel later said in a statement. \"People will write and say what they like, but I simply could not go on working with Liam a day longer.\" The feud continued over the years, with the pair exchanging insults publicly - Liam on social media, Noel more when asked about his brother in interviews - but reportedly never speaking in person. When his documentary As It Was was released in 2019, Liam told Sky News he had wanted to \"break [Noel's] jaw\" after he apparently refused permission for Oasis music to be featured in the film. But after 15 years, they have now made amends - giving thousands of Oasis fans the chance to see them play live once again. Their top hits include Wonderwall, Don't Look Back In Anger, Stand By Me, Lyla and The Importance of Being Idle."
