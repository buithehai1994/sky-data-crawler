        "Content": "\n          Asia correspondent\n              @CordeliaSkyNews\n  You can see, feel, hear the distress in Badakhshan's Provincial Hospital in Afghanistan. Warning: This article contains content some readers may find distressing. The halls are heavy with the sound of crying babies. The rooms, full of malnourished children, many two to a bed. Their frail, fragile bodies expose their wasting bones, with some so weak they're dependent on oxygen tanks to breathe. Afghanistan is facing an unprecedented crisis of hunger. More than 4.7 million women and children require urgent treatment for malnutrition, according to the UN. And 90% of children under the age of five are in food poverty. The hospital team in Badakhshan, in the northeast of the country, are doing all they can to keep the children alive. But increasing numbers are dying. In the last three months alone, roughly one baby died every three days here. Fifty-three have passed away so far this year - that's a 50% increase on the same time last year. Faisal is 12 months old. He's severely malnourished and has acute diarrhoea too. But like many on this ward, he has other serious complications. Among these is hydrocephalus, a condition that causes water to gather around his brain. His poor mother is so exhausted, she's lying on the floor by his bed. As she sits down to speak with us, she reveals she has already lost three children to malnutrition. \"I am worried about him and what might come next,\" she tells me. \"I've already lost three of my children. My first daughter died at eight years old. Two more of my children passed away when they were two-and-a-half years old.\" The ward is full of lost-looking eyes, dimmed by hunger. A horrifying thing to watch  Asma is 13 months old. But she weighs little over nine pounds (4kg) - less than half of what she should. Doctors fear she might not survive the night. But she's put on oxygen and by the morning, she thankfully starts to improve. \"I'm really afraid,\" her mother Khadijah says as her eyes fill. \"Of course I'm afraid, I've cried so much. I'm so thankful to the doctors, they've kept my baby alive. I'm so grateful to them,\" she says. But it's touch and go for her daughter, and there are long periods when her chest fails to rise and fall. It's a horrifying thing to watch - imagine as a parent sitting day and night, wondering whether the next breath might be her last. There is a stream of desperate cases coming through the doors here. Today, there are 20 babies to just 12 beds. Sometimes, it is even more crowded. There are suddenly two new arrivals. One of them, little Masouda. Her family travelled 13 hours to get here - spending what little they had left. She, too, has to be quickly placed on oxygen and she's painfully thin. Doctors tell us they fear she won't make it. The team are doing an incredible job during a hugely demanding time. But they need more staff, more medicine, more equipment. Hospitals and health clinics across Afghanistan have suffered major funding cuts. The US, which was Afghanistan's biggest aid donor, this year pulled almost all of its funding to the country. And the Taliban's restrictions on women and girls have proved a major barrier for many international donors. It's having a direct impact on children's chances of survival. Daniel Timme, chief of communication at UNICEF, said: \"The nutrition situation for children in Afghanistan is very serious and the numbers speak for themselves. Over 3.5 million children under five are acutely malnourished, including 1.4 million suffering life-threatening forms of wasting. \"It must be clear to everyone: when funding drops as we are seeing it now in a context with such high levels of malnutrition, preventable child deaths rise.\" A vital lifeline  In rural areas, poverty is as extreme as the landscape, and help for families with malnourished children is getting harder to reach. Layaba Health Clinic is a vital lifeline. The waiting room is full of mothers looking for medical assistance for their babies. Some women here tell us the Taliban's restrictions on them working and earning money have also played a part, making it harder for them to feed their families. \"They are to blame,\" one woman says with surprising candor. \"Every girl had her own dreams. I wanted to be a doctor. I took my responsibility for my children seriously. And I wanted to support my husband too.\" Another woman tells us she earned more than her husband as a teacher, but now finds herself unable to contribute financially. The Taliban's response  In an exclusive interview with Sky News, the Talibanâ€™s spokesman, Zabihullah Mujahid, said the malnutrition crisis was the product of decades of conflict. \"We have had to start from zero to rebuild and restore our national resources. The Islamic Emirate is making every possible effort to address these challenges.\" Mr Mujahid said his government had a five-year plan to \"tackle malnutrition, unemployment, and other pressing social issues\". In response to the complaints of the women we spoke to, he said that men in the \"vast majority\" of Afghan families were the breadwinners and claimed the Islamic Emirate had made \"significant efforts to promote vocational opportunities for women\". But under the Taliban, women can no longer train to be doctors, nurses and midwives. And in remote villages, community workers like Harira are often the only lifeline - a project part-funded by UNICEF. She goes door-to-door carrying baby scales, carrying out check-ups, trying to teach families about what to feed their children and when needed, get them to clinics and hospitals for treatment. It saved Ramzia's son's life. She had measles when she was pregnant and her son Faisal was very underweight. \"His legs and hands were as small as my fingers. Now he's much better,\" Harira says - beaming as she delights in the weight he has now put on. \"I was afraid I'd lose him,\" Ramzia says. \"He was so weak. But Harira came here and taught me how to feed him and give him milk when he needed it.\" Read more:Families fear months ahead after earthquake wiped out entire villagesTaliban internet blackout has created an extreme scenario Reeling from death, fighting for life  Keeping children alive in this climate is a battle. Nasrullah and Jamilah, who live on the outskirts of Fayzabad, are holding their two-month-old twins. But they're also in the throes of grief - on a journey to the grave of the baby they lost only a month ago. Her name was Shukriya. She was 18 months old. \"She was our child, we loved her. I will never forget her, so long as I'm alive. We really tried, we went to the doctors for check-ups, for ultrasounds, for blood work - we tried our very best. But none of it could save her.\" Both parents say they feared their twins could also face the same fate. Shukriya's grave is covered with one of her babygrows. It is haunting to see. And there are other little graves next to hers. Deaths aren't documented in a lot of these communities. But locals tell us more and more children are dying because of malnutrition. A silent, searing loss that is spreading."

        "Headline": "Egypt has agreed to host discussions on Monday, which also aim to iron out Hamas's reservations over Donald Trump's 20-point peace plan.",
        "Content": " Donald Trump has raised the pressure ahead of Monday's peace talks, urging negotiators to \"move fast\" as they attempt to end the fighting in Gaza and secure the release of hostages. The US president posted on Truth Social: \"TIME IS OF THE ESSENCE OR, MASSIVE BLOODSHED WILL FOLLOW - SOMETHING THAT NOBODY WANTS TO SEE!\" Egypt has agreed to host delegations from Israel and Hamas. An Israeli delegation led by strategic affairs minister Ron Dermer will attend the indirect negotiations in the Red Sea resort of Sharm el-Sheikh. US envoy Steve Witkoff is also expected to join. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said he hopes to announce the release of hostages being held in Gaza \"in the coming days\" and Hamas announced on Friday it would return all remaining hostages in Gaza, dead and alive. The group also said in a statement that it wants to engage in negotiations to discuss further points in the US president's peace plan. Speaking to our US partner network NBC, Donald Trump's secretary of state Marco Rubio said Hamas had also agreed \"in principle\" to what happens after the war in Gaza is over, but he warned the second phase of the deal, which concerns Hamas's disarmament and demobilisation, was \"not going to be easy\". \n                  Netanyahu backs Trump's peace plan for Gaza - as role for Blair revealed\n                 \n                  Destruction of Gaza's al-Quds hospital seen by nurse whose colleagues tell her 'they are going to die'\n                 \n                  Netanyahu is famous for wriggling out of impossible predicaments - but this may be his biggest test yet\n                 \"We'll know very quickly whether Hamas is serious or not by how these technical talks go in terms of the logistics,\" Mr Rubio added. On Sunday, Mr Trump posted that there had been \"very positive discussions with Hamas... to release the Hostages, end the War in Gaza but, more importantly, finally have long sought PEACE in the Middle East\". \"I am told that the first phase should be completed this week, and I am asking everyone to MOVE FAST,\" he added. The first phase deals with the release of hostages in exchange for the release of Palestinian prisoners. Progress in the discussions in Cairo will largely depend on whether the militant group agrees to Washington's withdrawal map, a Palestinian official close to the talks told Reuters. Mr Trump released a map showing the areas of Gaza the Israeli Defence Forces would need to withdraw its troops from, which he said had been agreed to already by Israel. Currently, the Israeli military has covered around 80% of the enclave in what it calls a \"dangerous combat zone\". If the peace plan follows the boundaries shown on the map, Israel's initial withdrawal would leave Gaza about 55% occupied, while the second withdrawal would leave it about 40% occupied. After the final withdrawal phase, which would create a \"security buffer zone\", about 15% of Gaza would be occupied by the Israeli military. It is this part - as well as the peace plan proposal for an international group to manage Gaza - \"that is going to be a little tougher to work through,\" Mr Rubio added. Calls for ceasefire Meanwhile, international support for an immediate ceasefire is growing. On Friday, Mr Trump told Israel to \"stop bombing Gaza\", and on Sunday Pope Leo renewed calls for a permanent ceasefire in the nearly two-year conflict. This was followed by the foreign ministers of eight Muslim-majority countries issuing a joint statement urging steps toward a possible end to fighting. In backing Hamas' willingness to hand over the running of Gaza to a transitional committee, the ministers called for an \"immediate launch of negotiations to agree on mechanisms to implement the proposal\". They also underlined their commitment to the return of the Palestinian Authority to Gaza, unifying Gaza and the West Bank, and reaching an agreement on security leading to a \"full Israeli withdrawal\" from Gaza. Read more:Why Trump accepted the Hamas peace plan responseIf Hamas and Israel agree a deal, it will be Trump's success  Israeli government spokeswoman Shosh Bedrosian told journalists: \"While certain bombings have actually stopped inside of the Gaza Strip, there's no ceasefire in place at this point in time.\" She said Mr Netanyahu is in \"regular contact\" with Mr Trump and that the prime minister has stressed talks in Egypt \"will be confined to a few days maximum, with no tolerance for manoeuvres that will delay talks by Hamas\". Residents and local hospitals said strikes continued across the Gaza Strip over the weekend. At least eight people were killed on Sunday in multiple strikes in the city, according to the Shifa hospital, which received the casualties. Half of them were killed in a strike that hit a group of people in Gaza City, the hospital said.  Four people also were killed in a shooting near an aid distribution site in the southern city of Rafah, according to Nasser hospital. The Israeli military said it was not involved in the shooting and did not immediately comment on the strikes. \"We're on the brink, and we don't know whether one will die of a strike or starvation,\" said Mahmoud Hashem, a Palestinian father of five, who is forced to shelter in a tent in the centre of Gaza City. When will hostages be freed? A lawyer representing the families of Israeli hostages held in Gaza has told Sky News now feels \"as good a chance as any\" to finally get the remaining captives out. Adam Wagner said hostage families were facing \"a huge mix of emotions\" as they awaited the latest developments in Mr Trump's 20-point peace plan. ðŸ‘‰Listen to The World with Richard Engel and Yalda Hakim on your podcast appðŸ‘ˆ \"We've seen hopes raised and the talks fail a number of times, but this seems as good a chance as any to get those 48 remaining hostages out,\" he said. Mr Wagner also agreed the \"big question\" for the talks was whether Hamas would agree to full disarmament and complete removal from the administration of Gaza. Israel estimates 48 hostages remain in Gaza, 20 of whom are alive."

        "Content": "A shake-up to the house-buying system which could cut a month off the time it takes - and slash around Â£700 from the moving bill - is on the table. Changes could include requiring property sellers and estate agents to provide more information when a home is listed for sale, reducing the need for buyers to carry out searches and surveys. Binding contracts could also be introduced at an earlier stage, reducing the risk of a chain collapsing. The proposals could also deliver clearer information to consumers about estate agents and conveyancers, including their track record and expertise, along with new mandatory qualifications and a code of practice to drive up standards. Housing Secretary Steve Reed said the proposals, which are the subject of a consultation, would help make \"a simple dream, a simple reality\". The government says it will set out a full roadmap in the new year after consulting on its proposals. Mr Reed said: \"Buying a home should be a dream, not a nightmare. \n                  Crunching the numbers behind Labour's pledge to build 180,000 new social homes\n                 \n                  Labour needs to focus on the working class, says Andy BurnhamÂ \n                 \n                  Children facing housing insecurity less likely to pass GCSEs, research shows\n                 \"Our reforms will fix the broken system so hardworking people can focus on the next chapter of their lives.\" Officials believe the proposed package of reforms could cut around a month off the time it takes to buy a new home and save first-time buyers an average of Â£710. People selling a home could face increased costs of around Â£310 due to the inclusion of upfront assessments and surveys. Those in the middle of a chain would potentially gain a net saving of Â£400 as a result of the increased costs from selling being outweighed by lower buying expenses. Wider use of online processes, including digital ID, could help make transactions smoother, the government argued, pointing to the Finnish digital real estate system which can see the process completed in around two weeks. The consultation also draws on other jurisdictions, including the Scottish system where there is more upfront information and earlier binding contracts. 'Process the same as for our grandparents' The planned shake-up was welcomed by property websites and lenders. Rightmove chief executive Johan Svanstrom said: \"The home-moving process involves many fragmented parts, and there's simply too much uncertainty and costs along the way. \"Speed, connected data and stakeholder simplicity should be key goals. We believe it's important to listen to agents as the experts for what practical changes will be most effective, and we look forward to working with the government on this effort to improve the buying and selling process.\" Santander's head of homes David Morris said: \"At a time when technology has changed many processes in our lives, it is incredible that the process of buying a home - an activity that is a cornerstone of our economy - remains much the same for today's buyers as it did for their grandparents.\" Conservative shadow housing minister Paul Holmes said that while Labour welcomed steps to digitise and speed up the process, the party risked \"reinventing the last Labour government's failed Home Information Packs - which reduced the number of homes put on sale, and duplicated costs across buyers and sellers\"."

Speaking at the Conservative Friends of Israel (CFoI) reception at the party conference in Manchester, Sharren Haskel hit out at Sir Keir Starmer's government for the decision to recognise Palestine, for \"out of control\" immigration that she said is changing the country and the rise of antisemitism in Britain. It was hoped that Tory leader Kemi Badenoch would attend the annual event, as her predecessors Rishi Sunak and Liz Truss did, and there was widespread surprise that she did not appear. Tory Party conference: Badenoch on Manchester synagogue attack One attendee told Sky News they were \"really surprised\" that she did not make remarks, and another said that in the chaotic years in government, they \"had about five leaders and they all showed up\".  But speeches were given by shadow cabinet ministers Sir James Cleverly, Chris Philp, Lord David Wolfson, along with shadow foreign secretary Dame Priti Patel who attacked Labour's \"dreadful decisions\". \"They [Labour] have lost any moral purpose whatsoever.

But in an excoriating attack on the Labour government, Ms Haskell questioned what it is going to do about the \"tsunami of Jew hatred and violence on Britain's streets that has exploded since the worst massacre of Jews since the Holocaust\". She also attacked the government's decision to recognise Palestine - a decision in which he played a leading role - as a \"grotesque betrayal of truth, of justice and of Britain's Jewish community\". She said it was no surprise that Deputy Prime Minister David Lammy was booed when he spoke at a vigil for the victims of the Manchester synagogue terror attack a few days ago.  Read more from Sky News:Badenoch: Streets are 'theatres of intimidation'Analysis: Labour under pressure over protestsAttack 'sadly something we feared was coming' Ms Haskell went further in attacking the government, criticising \"out of control immigration, particularly from Islamist communities hostile to your values\". \"It is fueling antisemitism on your street. It is straining your social cohesion. It is importing the demonisation of Jews and the hatred of the Middle East into British cities,\" added the Israeli deputy foreign minister. She closed with a rallying call to the attendees to not \"surrender\" to a \"woke agenda\" and be proud of their British and English heritage. Sky News has asked CCHQ why Kemi Badenoch did not attend the reception. The Tory leader has been highly vocal in her support for Israel and the Jewish community. She met the deputy foreign minister earlier on Sunday, and visited the scene of Thursday's terror attack at a Manchester synagogue before the conference began."

        "Content": " England rugby star Ellie Kildunne says girls playing rugby needs to stop being an \"anomaly\".Â  The 26-year-old full-back, whose early try kicked off the Red Rose's triumphant Rugby World Cup win over Canada, told Sky News sports presenter Jacquie Beltrao that she hopes the success of this England team does more for the sport. \"It's more than just winning the World Cup. Put the trophy to the side and just look around the stadium. We've done it,\" she said. \"We've done what we wanted to do. We've inspired so many people. We've got people with their bums on seats and that whole moment is something that I will try to relive over and over again for a long time.\"  Having had a passion for rugby since she was young, Kildunne said she hopes the sport becomes available for all girls to play in school, which historically hasn't been the case. She said: \"I just want young girls to know that it's nothing out of the normal to be a rugby player, that there's role models, that you can do whatever you want to do in life. \"For rugby, I hope more investment comes into the game at Premiership Women's Rugby (PWR) level and grassroots level, that more girls pick up a rugby ball, but also that it's taught in schools.  \"Rugby is more than just throwing a ball around the pitch. The values that it shares with you is something that I don't think you get in any other team sport. \"So like when the Lionesses won the Euros and then schools started bringing in football for girls. I want the same for rugby as well. It needs to stop being an anomaly that a girl plays rugby. \"We want to professionalise the PWR more so and keep on pushing for that being the best premiership league in the world.

I think one of the reasons was I was outside playing rugby most of the time. But number two, none of the Barbies really looked like me. \"I saw a Barbie as this really girly girl in a dress, and that's not saying that you can't be that when you're a rugby player. But for those young girls that don't play with Barbies because they don't see the resemblance, or they feel like they could never be a Barbie doll, now there's something that shows that you can.\" Each players' doll is a one-off, meaning it is not on sale to the public. 'The bin men have recognised me' For Kildunne herself, what does life look like after winning the World Cup? \"The bin men have recognised who I am,\" she tells Beltrao, adding that she has also been recognised in random shops, and in the pub. She said: \"If I'm honest, when that whistle went [during the final], I didn't really know what to do myself. I didn't even know that the whistle had gone. \"Then when I realised the whistle had gone, it was almost just pride. I don't want to say relief because it wasn't a relief. I never doubted this. I never had doubt in the team.\" The player said she is now going to focus on having a well-deserved holiday before getting back on the pitch with the Harlequins, the rugby union team she has played for since 2021."

        "Content": "By Ben Bloch, political reporter, at Conservative Party conference in Manchester  The Tories will pledge to make even further cuts to the foreign aid budget, as the party attempts to regain its reputation for fiscal responsibility in the wake of the Truss mini-budget. Shadow chancellor Sir Mel Stride will unveil plans to cut overseas development aid to 0.1% of Gross National Income (GNI), down from the current 0.3%, cementing a sea change in the Conservative Party's position on international aid. In his keynote speech to the party conference in Manchester, Sir Mel will claim that his plans can save Â£47bn over the next parliament, which include cuts to welfare, the civil service, and green subsidies. In the wake of the Truss mini-budget that saw the pound fall and interest rates soar, the senior MP will say that his party will \"never, ever make fiscal commitments without spelling out exactly how they will be paid for\", and commit to fiscal responsibility. A key part of Sir Mel's plans to demonstrate that is to reduce foreign aid to 0.1% of GNI, or around Â£3bn per year - down from spending of an estimated Â£9.4bn in 2028-29. The Boris Johnson government reduced aid spending to 0.5% of GNI in 2021, in order to pay for the vast public spending during the pandemic. Sir Keir Starmer announced a further cut to 0.3% of GNI earlier this year to pay for the increase in defence spending. Bond, the network for organisations working in international development and humanitarian assistance, has hit out at the announcement, describing it as \"reckless, short-sighted, and morally indefensible\". \n                  Israeli minister Sharren Haskel attacks Labour's 'grotesque betrayal' of Jewish community\n                 \n                  Kemi praises Thatcher but faces fight with grandees\n                 \n                  A subdued Tory conference could be a chance for Badenoch to turn her fortunes around - but will she?\n                 Its chief executive, Romilly Greenhill, told Conservatives at a fringe event at the Tory Party conference on Sunday: \"Let's just be really clear, such a policy would negatively impact millions of people around the world. \"It would harm deeply vital programmes being made in reducing, eradicating, killer diseases, and it would also severely undermine our ability to respond to devastating global crises.\"  But the Tories say they \"cannot justify taxing people in this country to pay for billions of spending abroad\", and it marks the death-knell of Tory former prime minister David Cameron's target of spending 0.7% of GNI on aid, announced in 2011. Welfare, green subsidies, and asylum hotels to face the chop Another key area where Sir Mel will pledge to make savings will be the welfare system, where they claim Â£23bn can be cut. He will say that narrowing the eligibility for sickness benefits, stopping claims from people with \"low-level mental health problems\" who could be treated instead, limiting the VAT subsidy for Motability, and reforming job-seeking obligations are key areas where savings can be made. But a major change will be restricting welfare to British citizens - bringing Tory party policy in line with Reform UK. But he will vow to reverse any decision from the current Labour government to lift the two-child benefit cap, which stands in contrast with Nigel Farage's party that wants to lift it. Sir Mel is expected to say the reforms are essential not just for balancing the books, but for tackling the deeper social damage caused by long-term dependency.  Another key target of the shadow chancellor is the civil service, where he will argue that Â£8bn in savings can be made by reducing the headcount from 517,000 down to 2016 levels of 384,000. Scrapping the Climate Change Act and \"costly and ineffective green subsidies being pushed by Ed Miliband\" is also on Sir Mel's agenda. The Tories say there are savings of Â£1.6bn a year to be made in this area. And closing all asylum hotels will save at least Â£3.5bn, the Tories say - at least Â£1.6bn of which they have already allocated to their new ICE-style \"removals force\", to detain and remove 150,000 illegal migrants per year. In his speech, Sir Mel Stride MP is expected to say: \"The Conservative Party will never, ever make fiscal commitments without spelling out exactly how they will be paid for. \"We're the only party that gets it. The only party that will stand up for fiscal responsibility. We must get on top of government spending. \"We cannot deliver stability unless we live within our means. No more pretending we can keep spending money we simply do not have.\"  ðŸ‘‰Listen to Politics at Sam and Anne's on your podcast appðŸ‘ˆ 'Trussonomics is still in full swing' But Labour Party chair Anna Turley said: \"The Tories let welfare bills, civil service numbers and asylum hotel use skyrocket on their watch - and they've never apologised. Now they want to rehash failed promises from their failed manifesto to try to solve the problems they caused. \"This is the same old Tories, with the same old policies. They didn't work then and you can't trust them now.\" And Liberal Democrat Treasury spokeswoman Daisy Cooper said it was \"clear the Conservative Party learnt absolutely nothing from their disastrous handling of the economy, which left families struggling with a cost-of-living crisis and public services on their knees\". She added: \"Cutting vital support to bring household bills down, trying to balance the books on the backs of people with mental health conditions and slashing the UK's soft power abroad through aid budget cuts shows Trussonomics is still in full swing.\""

        "Content": " A man who helped barricade the Manchester synagogue has described how the terror attack unfolded. Alan Levy said he was in the car park in the grounds of Heaton Park Hebrew Congregation Synagogue in Crumpsall when the incident started and he saw the attacker, who he called a \"jihadist monster\". \"I was there when he crashed his car into the synagogue gates and ran down the security guard that was there and attacked a volunteer security guard and tried to gain access,\" Mr Levy said in an interview with Sky News' people and politics correspondent Nick Martin. It was then Mr Levy ran into the synagogue and sought to lock it down. He and other congregants helped barricade the doors to stop the attacker from getting inside, as \"he was shoulder-charging the doors trying to get in\". \"He was throwing plant pots at the glass. He was using a knife to try and get in. These brave men basically saved the community from further harm,\" Mr Levy said. \"All I was thinking was 'we've got to keep these doors closed'. \"He was trying each door in turn. When we realised which door he was going to, we moved doors so there was more pressure on the doors to keep them closed.\" Two people were killed in the attack on Thursday, including one who died from a police bullet fired as officers shot dead the perpetrator, Jihad al Shamie. The victims were named as Adrian Daulby, 53, a member of the congregation, and Melvin Cravitz, 66, a worshipper at the synagogue. Mr Cravitz's funeral was held on Sunday. What we know about the synagogue attack in Manchester  Mr Levy's son, Marc, described the moment he first received news of the attack and said \"it's impossible to articulate the worry and concern\" as he didn't know whether his family was safe or not. \"I first knew that there was an incident when my phone started lighting up repeatedly and I realised that there was an attack on my synagogue,\" he said. \"It's a place where all my childhood memories of worshipping... pretty much going there throughout my whole life. \"I knew at that time that my father would have been on security at that time, as he is every morning, given that him and his friends are some of the first people who arrive.\" He said it was only when he saw his father on Sky News' live feed that he realised he wasn't one of the victims. Six people were arrested over the attack but two have been released without charge. Police revealed the attacker had been on bail over a suspected rape, but wasn't on the radar of counter-terror police. The Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) is investigating the shooting - this is standard practice when a member of the public is killed - and will examine \"whether police may have caused or contributed to the death\" of Mr Daulby. Al Shamie, 35, was named as the attacker on Thursday and is believed to be of Syrian descent. He is understood to have been granted British citizenship when he was around 16, having entered the UK as a young child. Police shot him dead seven minutes after the first emergency call as they feared he was wearing an explosive device - later identified as a fake."

Speaking just days after a terror attack at a synagogue in the city left two people dead, the Tory leader claimed extremism \"has gone unchecked\" in the UK. Politics live: Government grants police new powers in crackdown on repeat protests She said this had manifested in Pro-Palestine protests which are \"in fact carnivals of hatred directed at the Jewish homeland\". She cited the use of \"asinine slogans\" such as 'Globalise the Intifada', saying this \"means nothing at all, if it doesn't mean targeting Jewish people for violence\".  Ms Badenoch added: \"So the message from this conference, from this party, from every decent and right-thinking person in this country must be that we will not stand for it any more. We cannot import and tolerate values hostile to our own. \"We must now draw a line and say that in Britain you can think what you like, and within the bounds of the law you can say what you like, but you have no right to turn our streets into the theatres of intimidation and we will not let you do so any more.\" \n                  Shadow chancellor to pledge further cuts to foreign aid - as Tories vow to 'stand up for fiscal responsibility'\n                 \n                  Kemi praises Thatcher but faces fight with grandees\n                 \n                  Israeli minister Sharren Haskel attacks Labour's 'grotesque betrayal' of Jewish community\n                 Ms Badenoch has said she supports the government's efforts to impose restrictions on repeat protests in light of the Manchester terror attack. Nearly 500 people were arrested over protests supporting the proscribed group Palestine Action in central London on Saturday. Demonstrators defied calls from political leaders, including Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer, to reconsider the event out of respect for the grief of the British Jewish community. The chief of the Metropolitan Police, Sir Mark Rowley, also called for the event to be postponed, saying he was worried resources would be stretched and the ability of the force to protect communities would be compromised. ECHR plan 'not vague mush' Elsewhere in her speech, Ms Badenoch spoke about her policy to leave the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) and carry out \"ICE-style\" deportations if she wins the next election.  She said that shadow Northern Ireland Secretary Alex Burghart will lead a review into a union-wide implementation of leaving the ECHR, so voters have \"a clear, thorough and robust plan, not the vague mush that we see day in, day out from Labour, nor the vacuous posturing that we see day in, day out from Reform\". The plan has been condemned by Former Conservative justice secretary and Lord Chancellor Robert Buckland, who lost his seat at the 2024 election.

It would be a profound mistake to go down this path,\" he wrote in an article for Conservative Home. The comments reflect how the issue has long divided the party, with \"one nation\" moderates like Mr Buckland opposed to the idea of leaving the ECHR, and others seeing it as necessary to get a grip on illegal migration and tackle Reform UK. In a sign she won't shy away from that fight, Ms Badenoch told GB News earlier that every Conservative candidate must sign up to her plan to leave the ECHR, or they would be barred from standing at the next election. 'Mountain to climb' The Tories are languishing in the polls behind Reform and Labour after suffering their worst-ever defeat at the election last year. Ms Badenoch, who was elected to lead the party last November, ended her speech acknowledging there was a \"mountain to climb\" but insisting she was up for the fight. \"Britain needs deep change. But I reject the politics that everything must go, that everything must be torn down, that everything is broken,\" she said. \"If we leave it to Labour or Reform, Britain will be divided. Only the Conservatives can bring this country back together. \"So, I say to you all as we start our conference, yes, we have a mountain to climb, but we have a song in our hearts, and we are up for the fight.\""

Green Party leader Zack Polanski told Sky News: \"Giving police sweeping powers to shut down protests because of their 'cumulative impact' is a cynical assault on the right to dissent. The whole point of protest is persistence; that's how change happens. Do you think the suffragettes protested once and then gave up?\" Lib Dem home affairs spokesman Max Wilkinson said this will \"do nothing\" to tackle antisemitism \"while undermining the fundamental right to peaceful protest\". Earlier, Ms Mahmood said the right to protest was a \"fundamental freedom\" but this must be balanced \"with the freedom of their neighbours to live their lives without fear\". In a statement she said: \"Large, repeated protests can leave sections of our country, particularly religious communities, feeling unsafe, intimidated and scared to leave their homes.â€¯ \"This has been particularly evident in relation to the considerable fear within the Jewish community, which has been expressed to me on many occasions in these recent difficult days. \"These changes mark an important step in ensuring we protect the right to protest while ensuring all feel safe in this country.\" Tories 'will support' measures Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch said her party will \"of course support\" the new measures but asked why it took \"so long\" for them to be introduced. Speaking to the BBC's Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg, she claimed that what happened in Manchester was foreseeable and not enough has been done to address fears over safety in the Jewish community. Ms Mahmood addressed the Jewish communities' concerns after being shown a clip of deputy prime minister David Lammy being heckled at a vigil on Friday.   She told Sky News' Trevor Phillips the government \"of course\" hears their strength of feeling and is \"committed to dealing with antisemitism in all of its forms\", pointing to the \"strengthening\" of police powers announced today. Asked if the reaction to Mr Lammy reflected anger at the government's decision to recognise a Palestine state, she said it was important not to \"elide\" Thursday's attack with the situation in the Middle East. \"People are entitled to their views and of course we were there to hear those views. What I would say is that the attack that took place, the person that's responsible for that attack is the attacker himself,\" she said. \"And, of course, four other people are in custody and the police investigation does need to take its course. It's important that we don't elide that into the wider questions of what's going on in the Middle East.\""

        "Content": "A shake-up to the house-buying system which could cut a month off the time it takes - and slash around Â£700 from the moving bill - is on the table. Changes could include requiring property sellers and estate agents to provide more information when a home is listed for sale, reducing the need for buyers to carry out searches and surveys. Binding contracts could also be introduced at an earlier stage, reducing the risk of a chain collapsing. The proposals could also deliver clearer information to consumers about estate agents and conveyancers, including their track record and expertise, along with new mandatory qualifications and a code of practice to drive up standards. Housing Secretary Steve Reed said the proposals, which are the subject of a consultation, would help make \"a simple dream, a simple reality\". The government says it will set out a full roadmap in the new year after consulting on its proposals. Mr Reed said: \"Buying a home should be a dream, not a nightmare. \n                  Crunching the numbers behind Labour's pledge to build 180,000 new social homes\n                 \n                  Labour needs to focus on the working class, says Andy BurnhamÂ \n                 \n                  Children facing housing insecurity less likely to pass GCSEs, research shows\n                 \"Our reforms will fix the broken system so hardworking people can focus on the next chapter of their lives.\" Officials believe the proposed package of reforms could cut around a month off the time it takes to buy a new home and save first-time buyers an average of Â£710. People selling a home could face increased costs of around Â£310 due to the inclusion of upfront assessments and surveys. Those in the middle of a chain would potentially gain a net saving of Â£400 as a result of the increased costs from selling being outweighed by lower buying expenses. Wider use of online processes, including digital ID, could help make transactions smoother, the government argued, pointing to the Finnish digital real estate system which can see the process completed in around two weeks. The consultation also draws on other jurisdictions, including the Scottish system where there is more upfront information and earlier binding contracts. 'Process the same as for our grandparents' The planned shake-up was welcomed by property websites and lenders. Rightmove chief executive Johan Svanstrom said: \"The home-moving process involves many fragmented parts, and there's simply too much uncertainty and costs along the way. \"Speed, connected data and stakeholder simplicity should be key goals. We believe it's important to listen to agents as the experts for what practical changes will be most effective, and we look forward to working with the government on this effort to improve the buying and selling process.\" Santander's head of homes David Morris said: \"At a time when technology has changed many processes in our lives, it is incredible that the process of buying a home - an activity that is a cornerstone of our economy - remains much the same for today's buyers as it did for their grandparents.\" Conservative shadow housing minister Paul Holmes said that while Labour welcomed steps to digitise and speed up the process, the party risked \"reinventing the last Labour government's failed Home Information Packs - which reduced the number of homes put on sale, and duplicated costs across buyers and sellers\"."

In a statement she said: \"Large, repeated protests can leave sections of our country, particularly religious communities, feeling unsafe, intimidated and scared to leave their homes.â€¯ \"This has been particularly evident in relation to the considerable fear within the Jewish community, which has been expressed to me on many occasions in these recent difficult days. \"These changes mark an important step in ensuring we protect the right to protest while ensuring all feel safe in this country.\" Tories 'will support' measures Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch said her party will \"of course support\" the new measures but asked why it took \"so long\" for them to be introduced. Speaking to the BBC's Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg, she claimed that what happened in Manchester was foreseeable and not enough has been done to address fears over safety in the Jewish community. Ms Mahmood addressed the Jewish communities' concerns after being shown a clip of deputy prime minister David Lammy being heckled at a vigil on Friday.   She told Sky News' Trevor Phillips the government \"of course\" hears their strength of feeling and is \"committed to dealing with antisemitism in all of its forms\", pointing to the \"strengthening\" of police powers announced today. Asked if the reaction to Mr Lammy reflected anger at the government's decision to recognise a Palestine state, she said it was important not to \"elide\" Thursday's attack with the situation in the Middle East. \"People are entitled to their views and of course we were there to hear those views. What I would say is that the attack that took place, the person that's responsible for that attack is the attacker himself,\" she said. \"And, of course, four other people are in custody and the police investigation does need to take its course. It's important that we don't elide that into the wider questions of what's going on in the Middle East.\""

        "Content": " A man who helped barricade the Manchester synagogue has described how the terror attack unfolded. Alan Levy said he was in the car park in the grounds of Heaton Park Hebrew Congregation Synagogue in Crumpsall when the incident started and he saw the attacker, who he called a \"jihadist monster\". \"I was there when he crashed his car into the synagogue gates and ran down the security guard that was there and attacked a volunteer security guard and tried to gain access,\" Mr Levy said in an interview with Sky News' people and politics correspondent Nick Martin. It was then Mr Levy ran into the synagogue and sought to lock it down. He and other congregants helped barricade the doors to stop the attacker from getting inside, as \"he was shoulder-charging the doors trying to get in\". \"He was throwing plant pots at the glass. He was using a knife to try and get in. These brave men basically saved the community from further harm,\" Mr Levy said. \"All I was thinking was 'we've got to keep these doors closed'. \"He was trying each door in turn. When we realised which door he was going to, we moved doors so there was more pressure on the doors to keep them closed.\" Two people were killed in the attack on Thursday, including one who died from a police bullet fired as officers shot dead the perpetrator, Jihad al Shamie. The victims were named as Adrian Daulby, 53, a member of the congregation, and Melvin Cravitz, 66, a worshipper at the synagogue. Mr Cravitz's funeral was held on Sunday. What we know about the synagogue attack in Manchester  Mr Levy's son, Marc, described the moment he first received news of the attack and said \"it's impossible to articulate the worry and concern\" as he didn't know whether his family was safe or not. \"I first knew that there was an incident when my phone started lighting up repeatedly and I realised that there was an attack on my synagogue,\" he said. \"It's a place where all my childhood memories of worshipping... pretty much going there throughout my whole life. \"I knew at that time that my father would have been on security at that time, as he is every morning, given that him and his friends are some of the first people who arrive.\" He said it was only when he saw his father on Sky News' live feed that he realised he wasn't one of the victims. Six people were arrested over the attack but two have been released without charge. Police revealed the attacker had been on bail over a suspected rape, but wasn't on the radar of counter-terror police. The Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) is investigating the shooting - this is standard practice when a member of the public is killed - and will examine \"whether police may have caused or contributed to the death\" of Mr Daulby. Al Shamie, 35, was named as the attacker on Thursday and is believed to be of Syrian descent. He is understood to have been granted British citizenship when he was around 16, having entered the UK as a young child. Police shot him dead seven minutes after the first emergency call as they feared he was wearing an explosive device - later identified as a fake."

        "Content": "\n          Political reporter\n              @fayebrownSky\n  The streets of Britain have turned into \"theatres of intimidation\", Kemi Badenoch has warned in a speech to mark the opening of the Conservative Party Conference in Manchester. Speaking just days after a terror attack at a synagogue in the city left two people dead, the Tory leader claimed extremism \"has gone unchecked\" in the UK. Politics live: Government grants police new powers in crackdown on repeat protests She said this had manifested in Pro-Palestine protests which are \"in fact carnivals of hatred directed at the Jewish homeland\". She cited the use of \"asinine slogans\" such as 'Globalise the Intifada', saying this \"means nothing at all, if it doesn't mean targeting Jewish people for violence\".  Ms Badenoch added: \"So the message from this conference, from this party, from every decent and right-thinking person in this country must be that we will not stand for it any more. We cannot import and tolerate values hostile to our own. \"We must now draw a line and say that in Britain you can think what you like, and within the bounds of the law you can say what you like, but you have no right to turn our streets into the theatres of intimidation and we will not let you do so any more.\" \n                  Shadow chancellor to pledge further cuts to foreign aid - as Tories vow to 'stand up for fiscal responsibility'\n                 \n                  Kemi praises Thatcher but faces fight with grandees\n                 \n                  Israeli minister Sharren Haskel attacks Labour's 'grotesque betrayal' of Jewish community\n                 Ms Badenoch has said she supports the government's efforts to impose restrictions on repeat protests in light of the Manchester terror attack. Nearly 500 people were arrested over protests supporting the proscribed group Palestine Action in central London on Saturday. Demonstrators defied calls from political leaders, including Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer, to reconsider the event out of respect for the grief of the British Jewish community. The chief of the Metropolitan Police, Sir Mark Rowley, also called for the event to be postponed, saying he was worried resources would be stretched and the ability of the force to protect communities would be compromised. ECHR plan 'not vague mush' Elsewhere in her speech, Ms Badenoch spoke about her policy to leave the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) and carry out \"ICE-style\" deportations if she wins the next election.  She said that shadow Northern Ireland Secretary Alex Burghart will lead a review into a union-wide implementation of leaving the ECHR, so voters have \"a clear, thorough and robust plan, not the vague mush that we see day in, day out from Labour, nor the vacuous posturing that we see day in, day out from Reform\". The plan has been condemned by Former Conservative justice secretary and Lord Chancellor Robert Buckland, who lost his seat at the 2024 election. Read More:Active plot against Kemi Badenoch at this party conference in Manchester \"I have seen first-hand how deeply this issue touches our constitution, our Union, and our international standing. It would be a profound mistake to go down this path,\" he wrote in an article for Conservative Home. The comments reflect how the issue has long divided the party, with \"one nation\" moderates like Mr Buckland opposed to the idea of leaving the ECHR, and others seeing it as necessary to get a grip on illegal migration and tackle Reform UK. In a sign she won't shy away from that fight, Ms Badenoch told GB News earlier that every Conservative candidate must sign up to her plan to leave the ECHR, or they would be barred from standing at the next election. 'Mountain to climb' The Tories are languishing in the polls behind Reform and Labour after suffering their worst-ever defeat at the election last year. Ms Badenoch, who was elected to lead the party last November, ended her speech acknowledging there was a \"mountain to climb\" but insisting she was up for the fight. \"Britain needs deep change. But I reject the politics that everything must go, that everything must be torn down, that everything is broken,\" she said. \"If we leave it to Labour or Reform, Britain will be divided. Only the Conservatives can bring this country back together. \"So, I say to you all as we start our conference, yes, we have a mountain to climb, but we have a song in our hearts, and we are up for the fight.\""

        "Content": " England rugby star Ellie Kildunne says girls playing rugby needs to stop being an \"anomaly\".Â  The 26-year-old full-back, whose early try kicked off the Red Rose's triumphant Rugby World Cup win over Canada, told Sky News sports presenter Jacquie Beltrao that she hopes the success of this England team does more for the sport. \"It's more than just winning the World Cup. Put the trophy to the side and just look around the stadium. We've done it,\" she said. \"We've done what we wanted to do. We've inspired so many people. We've got people with their bums on seats and that whole moment is something that I will try to relive over and over again for a long time.\"  Having had a passion for rugby since she was young, Kildunne said she hopes the sport becomes available for all girls to play in school, which historically hasn't been the case. She said: \"I just want young girls to know that it's nothing out of the normal to be a rugby player, that there's role models, that you can do whatever you want to do in life. \"For rugby, I hope more investment comes into the game at Premiership Women's Rugby (PWR) level and grassroots level, that more girls pick up a rugby ball, but also that it's taught in schools.  \"Rugby is more than just throwing a ball around the pitch. The values that it shares with you is something that I don't think you get in any other team sport. \"So like when the Lionesses won the Euros and then schools started bringing in football for girls. I want the same for rugby as well. It needs to stop being an anomaly that a girl plays rugby. \"We want to professionalise the PWR more so and keep on pushing for that being the best premiership league in the world. And players will get better. Players can actually invest themselves into the game of rugby rather than having to work two jobs.\" Read more from Sky News:Home buying shake-up aims to make process cheaper, quicker and easierPolice to get new powers to impose restrictions on repeat protestsStreets of UK have turned into 'theatres of intimidation' - Badenoch 'I will never see myself as an icon' A Rugby Football Union (RFU) survey of female rugby players and coaches found last year that the biggest challenges of the sport include the negative perception of female players, unequal opportunities, inappropriate kit and players' menstrual cycle. Helping to break down perceptions of female rugby players, Kildunne is one of four international players being made into a Barbie doll. When asked what her reaction was to the doll, Kildunne said: \"I just couldn't believe it. Icons get Barbies and I would never see myself as an icon. I will never see myself as an icon. I am just a girl that plays rugby. \"I just thought, really me? You want to make one of me? But, you know, I felt very proud, giddy, very excited. \"I didn't play with Barbies when I was growing up. I think one of the reasons was I was outside playing rugby most of the time. But number two, none of the Barbies really looked like me. \"I saw a Barbie as this really girly girl in a dress, and that's not saying that you can't be that when you're a rugby player. But for those young girls that don't play with Barbies because they don't see the resemblance, or they feel like they could never be a Barbie doll, now there's something that shows that you can.\" Each players' doll is a one-off, meaning it is not on sale to the public. 'The bin men have recognised me' For Kildunne herself, what does life look like after winning the World Cup? \"The bin men have recognised who I am,\" she tells Beltrao, adding that she has also been recognised in random shops, and in the pub. She said: \"If I'm honest, when that whistle went [during the final], I didn't really know what to do myself. I didn't even know that the whistle had gone. \"Then when I realised the whistle had gone, it was almost just pride. I don't want to say relief because it wasn't a relief. I never doubted this. I never had doubt in the team.\" The player said she is now going to focus on having a well-deserved holiday before getting back on the pitch with the Harlequins, the rugby union team she has played for since 2021."

        "Content": "By Ben Bloch, political reporter, at Conservative Party conference in Manchester  The Tories will pledge to make even further cuts to the foreign aid budget, as the party attempts to regain its reputation for fiscal responsibility in the wake of the Truss mini-budget. Shadow chancellor Sir Mel Stride will unveil plans to cut overseas development aid to 0.1% of Gross National Income (GNI), down from the current 0.3%, cementing a sea change in the Conservative Party's position on international aid. In his keynote speech to the party conference in Manchester, Sir Mel will claim that his plans can save Â£47bn over the next parliament, which include cuts to welfare, the civil service, and green subsidies. In the wake of the Truss mini-budget that saw the pound fall and interest rates soar, the senior MP will say that his party will \"never, ever make fiscal commitments without spelling out exactly how they will be paid for\", and commit to fiscal responsibility. A key part of Sir Mel's plans to demonstrate that is to reduce foreign aid to 0.1% of GNI, or around Â£3bn per year - down from spending of an estimated Â£9.4bn in 2028-29. The Boris Johnson government reduced aid spending to 0.5% of GNI in 2021, in order to pay for the vast public spending during the pandemic. Sir Keir Starmer announced a further cut to 0.3% of GNI earlier this year to pay for the increase in defence spending. Bond, the network for organisations working in international development and humanitarian assistance, has hit out at the announcement, describing it as \"reckless, short-sighted, and morally indefensible\". \n                  Israeli minister Sharren Haskel attacks Labour's 'grotesque betrayal' of Jewish community\n                 \n                  Kemi praises Thatcher but faces fight with grandees\n                 \n                  A subdued Tory conference could be a chance for Badenoch to turn her fortunes around - but will she?\n                 Its chief executive, Romilly Greenhill, told Conservatives at a fringe event at the Tory Party conference on Sunday: \"Let's just be really clear, such a policy would negatively impact millions of people around the world. \"It would harm deeply vital programmes being made in reducing, eradicating, killer diseases, and it would also severely undermine our ability to respond to devastating global crises.\"  But the Tories say they \"cannot justify taxing people in this country to pay for billions of spending abroad\", and it marks the death-knell of Tory former prime minister David Cameron's target of spending 0.7% of GNI on aid, announced in 2011. Welfare, green subsidies, and asylum hotels to face the chop Another key area where Sir Mel will pledge to make savings will be the welfare system, where they claim Â£23bn can be cut. He will say that narrowing the eligibility for sickness benefits, stopping claims from people with \"low-level mental health problems\" who could be treated instead, limiting the VAT subsidy for Motability, and reforming job-seeking obligations are key areas where savings can be made. But a major change will be restricting welfare to British citizens - bringing Tory party policy in line with Reform UK. But he will vow to reverse any decision from the current Labour government to lift the two-child benefit cap, which stands in contrast with Nigel Farage's party that wants to lift it. Sir Mel is expected to say the reforms are essential not just for balancing the books, but for tackling the deeper social damage caused by long-term dependency.  Another key target of the shadow chancellor is the civil service, where he will argue that Â£8bn in savings can be made by reducing the headcount from 517,000 down to 2016 levels of 384,000. Scrapping the Climate Change Act and \"costly and ineffective green subsidies being pushed by Ed Miliband\" is also on Sir Mel's agenda. The Tories say there are savings of Â£1.6bn a year to be made in this area. And closing all asylum hotels will save at least Â£3.5bn, the Tories say - at least Â£1.6bn of which they have already allocated to their new ICE-style \"removals force\", to detain and remove 150,000 illegal migrants per year. In his speech, Sir Mel Stride MP is expected to say: \"The Conservative Party will never, ever make fiscal commitments without spelling out exactly how they will be paid for. \"We're the only party that gets it. The only party that will stand up for fiscal responsibility. We must get on top of government spending. \"We cannot deliver stability unless we live within our means. No more pretending we can keep spending money we simply do not have.\"  ðŸ‘‰Listen to Politics at Sam and Anne's on your podcast appðŸ‘ˆ 'Trussonomics is still in full swing' But Labour Party chair Anna Turley said: \"The Tories let welfare bills, civil service numbers and asylum hotel use skyrocket on their watch - and they've never apologised. Now they want to rehash failed promises from their failed manifesto to try to solve the problems they caused. \"This is the same old Tories, with the same old policies. They didn't work then and you can't trust them now.\" And Liberal Democrat Treasury spokeswoman Daisy Cooper said it was \"clear the Conservative Party learnt absolutely nothing from their disastrous handling of the economy, which left families struggling with a cost-of-living crisis and public services on their knees\". She added: \"Cutting vital support to bring household bills down, trying to balance the books on the backs of people with mental health conditions and slashing the UK's soft power abroad through aid budget cuts shows Trussonomics is still in full swing.\""

        "Content": "\n          Chief political correspondent\n              @joncraig\n Just days before the 100th anniversary of the birth of Margaret Thatcher, on 13 October, Kemi Badenoch opened the Conservative conference by twice praising the party's heroine and three-time election winner. \"The facts of life are Conservative,\" the Tory leader declared, quoting the former PM, before praising her for breaking the cycle of high inflation, low growth and the stranglehold of the trade unions in the 1980s. But as her rather flat delivery in her 28-minute opening speech confirmed, Ms Badenoch is no Margaret Thatcher. (Perhaps she needs a voice coach, like Mrs T, who was transformed by tutoring from Gordon Reece in her early days as Tory leader.) For lovers of political trivia, however, Kemi and Maggie do have one thing in common. Both met their husbands when they were fighting a Labour seat before becoming an MP. The dashing Denis Thatcher famously gave Margaret a lift back to London from Dartford, where she was candidate in 1950 and 1951, in his Jaguar sports car. \n                  Israeli minister Sharren Haskel attacks Labour's 'grotesque betrayal' of Jewish community\n                 \n                  Shadow chancellor to pledge further cuts to foreign aid - as Tories vow to 'stand up for fiscal responsibility'\n                 \n                  A subdued Tory conference could be a chance for Badenoch to turn her fortunes around - but will she?\n                 Some 60 years later, banker Hamish Badenoch, a former head boy at Ampleforth school - the Roman Catholic boarding school run by monks - gave Kemi lifts in his car when she was candidate against Labour's Tessa Jowell in Dulwich and West Norwood in the 2010 general election. Sadly, Margaret Thatcher saw several acts of terrorism at close hand - the 1984 Brighton bomb being the most devastating example - and here Kemi Badenoch's speech began with solemn references to the Manchester synagogue attack. She entered the hall to almost funereal music and her tone was solemn, before she launched into a fierce attack on the weekend's pro-Palestine protests, which the prime minister and home secretary had urged organisers to call off. These marches were \"carnivals of hate\" and \"theatres of intimidation\", she declared, in an attack that rather overshadowed her much-trailed announcement of quitting the European Convention of Human Rights and plans to deport 150,000 illegal migrants a year.  The ECHR announcement did bring the rather subdued 1,000-strong audience to life, however, and they also applauded when she attacked Nigel Farage's controversial plan to axe indefinite leave to remain status for migrants legally living in the UK. \"I am British, as we all are,\" she said. \"My children are British, and I will not allow anyone on the left to tell them that they belong in a different category, or anyone on the right to tell them that they do not belong in their own country.\" To be fair, the sombre mood just days after the Manchester synagogue deaths meant this was not the time for a knockabout speech from the Tory leader. That will come on Wednesday when she makes the final speech of this conference. But before then, her leadership and her policies won't go unchallenged.  Shortly before she was praising Margaret Thatcher in her speech, there was a rumour that one of Mrs T's most devoted Tory MP fans, the Romford MP Andrew Rosindell, was being courted by Reform UK as a potential defector and was poised to jump. \"What would Mrs T say?\" Sky News asked Rosindell, who's such a devotee that his Romford Tory HQ was officially opened by his heroine and is called Margaret Thatcher House. He replied: \"Mrs T would not believe all she read on Twitter. Fortunately, there was no social media in those days.\" So was that a yes or a no? \"No,\" he replied, adding: \"If I decide to defect to the Lib Dems you'll be the first to know.\" What a tease! ðŸ‘‰Tap here to follow Politics At Sam And Anne's on your podcast appðŸ‘ˆ And as the Conservative party prepares to celebrate the Thatcher anniversary, who should turn up in Manchester but the big beast who did more to bring her down in 1990 than any other Tory politician. Michael Heseltine, now 92 and once the darling of Tory activists and the party's favourite blond apart from Margaret Thatcher, is due to address a European Movement fringe meeting, where he will no doubt denounce Kemi's plan to bin the ECHR. The woman dubbed KemiKaze by her critics ended her speech by claiming the Conservatives are \"up for the fight\". Unfortunately, her ECHR plan may provoke a fight with big beasts and grandees like Michael Heseltine in her own party. But on the evidence so far, and given her claim in her speech that the party has changed, she's up for the fight with the grandees too."

        "Content": " Police have launched an investigation after a suspected arson attack at a mosque in East Sussex - as footage shows the moment the fire erupted. Emergency services were called to the fire in Peacehaven around 9.50pm on Saturday, Sussex Police said. Doorbell video emerged on Sunday, showing a person on the steps at the entrance of the mosque - and a second person standing at the bottom. Both were wearing balaclavas. Moments later the blaze erupts and someone runs to safety from inside the building. Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood said the attack on the mosque was \"deeply concerning\" and she urged people to \"stand united\". Photos from the scene showed a burnt-out car in front of the door to the mosque. The police force said no one was harmed and it was treating the incident as a hate crime.

        "Content": "\n          Deputy political editor\n              @SamCoatesSky\n  Make no mistake. There is an active plot against Kemi Badenoch at this party conference in Manchester. The leadership will never be entirely sure which mishaps, bad stories and unfortunate events are the consequence of a deliberate strategy - and which are just another thing going wrong with a party straining to stay afloat. This plot does not have rigid KPIs. There is no timeframe attached to its efforts. The goal is only to undermine her rather than oust her immediately. But the Tory wars have not gone away. We may have seen Labour tensions on display at their conference in Liverpool last week, but nobody does internecine party-on-party hostility quite like the oldest political party in the world. Like Britain, are the Tories becoming ungovernable? Take the defection of a one-time donor to Kemi Badenoch's leadership campaign a year ago, which I revealed this lunchtime. Is that part of the plot or not? CCHQ will never know. Either way, it's serious because of the lessons it teaches us. The background - which can be heard on the Politics At Sam And Anne's podcast which has just been released - is that veteran public affairs professional Mark Gallagher has abandoned Kemi Badenoch in favour of Nigel Farage's Reform UK. \n                  Israeli minister Sharren Haskel attacks Labour's 'grotesque betrayal' of Jewish community\n                 \n                  Kemi praises Thatcher but faces fight with grandees\n                 \n                  A subdued Tory conference could be a chance for Badenoch to turn her fortunes around - but will she?\n                 While he still is understood to like Badenoch personally, he thinks the Tories are not a strong enough medicine for the country. Gallagher is a long-term supporter of several political parties including the Brexit party and, having given Â£2,000 only, he is not Badenoch's largest donor by a long way. There is a suggestion that Badenoch did not respond quickly enough to his messages and attempts to help her. Look at - and internalise - the response from the Tories. An aide to Badenoch said: \"She gets 20 texts every minute from MPs, friends, ex-MPs, supporters, peers, people offering advice and so on. She endeavours to go back to everyone, but realistically she's running the world's oldest political party, doing media interviews, having meetings, doing visits, and being a wife and mother of three young children. So it would be churlish to get quite so upset about timely responses.\" You can sense the intensity of the frustration - the anger at criticism. The willingness to thrash back. Are these wise feelings to succumb to at this point? The Tories claim this does not amount to a \"defection\" because Gallagher hadn't been a member of the Conservative Party since 2020. However, they do not contest that he gave to Badenoch's leadership and now Gallagher is helping her rival. Top Tories talk of three key moments in the coming months. Post May elections, which could be perilous without signs of electoral improvement. Then the November 26 budget if she doesn't perform well - another danger point. Finally the first anniversary of her becoming leader, on November 2 this year. That's the first moment that MPs can submit letters to the newish 1922 chairman Bob Blackman. It takes more than it used to - they changed the rules last year so you now need a third rather than 15% - that's now a third of 119, so 40. So another moment of peril. This week will determine what matters. There is a plot. It's not going away. We just don't know when it will materialise."

        "Content": "\n          Asia correspondent\n              @CordeliaSkyNews\n  You can see, feel, hear the distress in Badakhshan's Provincial Hospital in Afghanistan. Warning: This article contains content some readers may find distressing. The halls are heavy with the sound of crying babies. The rooms, full of malnourished children, many two to a bed. Their frail, fragile bodies expose their wasting bones, with some so weak they're dependent on oxygen tanks to breathe. Afghanistan is facing an unprecedented crisis of hunger. More than 4.7 million women and children require urgent treatment for malnutrition, according to the UN. And 90% of children under the age of five are in food poverty. The hospital team in Badakhshan, in the northeast of the country, are doing all they can to keep the children alive. But increasing numbers are dying. In the last three months alone, roughly one baby died every three days here. Fifty-three have passed away so far this year - that's a 50% increase on the same time last year. Faisal is 12 months old. He's severely malnourished and has acute diarrhoea too. But like many on this ward, he has other serious complications. Among these is hydrocephalus, a condition that causes water to gather around his brain. His poor mother is so exhausted, she's lying on the floor by his bed. As she sits down to speak with us, she reveals she has already lost three children to malnutrition. \"I am worried about him and what might come next,\" she tells me. \"I've already lost three of my children. My first daughter died at eight years old. Two more of my children passed away when they were two-and-a-half years old.\" The ward is full of lost-looking eyes, dimmed by hunger. A horrifying thing to watch  Asma is 13 months old. But she weighs little over nine pounds (4kg) - less than half of what she should. Doctors fear she might not survive the night. But she's put on oxygen and by the morning, she thankfully starts to improve. \"I'm really afraid,\" her mother Khadijah says as her eyes fill. \"Of course I'm afraid, I've cried so much. I'm so thankful to the doctors, they've kept my baby alive. I'm so grateful to them,\" she says. But it's touch and go for her daughter, and there are long periods when her chest fails to rise and fall. It's a horrifying thing to watch - imagine as a parent sitting day and night, wondering whether the next breath might be her last. There is a stream of desperate cases coming through the doors here. Today, there are 20 babies to just 12 beds. Sometimes, it is even more crowded. There are suddenly two new arrivals. One of them, little Masouda. Her family travelled 13 hours to get here - spending what little they had left. She, too, has to be quickly placed on oxygen and she's painfully thin. Doctors tell us they fear she won't make it. The team are doing an incredible job during a hugely demanding time. But they need more staff, more medicine, more equipment. Hospitals and health clinics across Afghanistan have suffered major funding cuts. The US, which was Afghanistan's biggest aid donor, this year pulled almost all of its funding to the country. And the Taliban's restrictions on women and girls have proved a major barrier for many international donors. It's having a direct impact on children's chances of survival. Daniel Timme, chief of communication at UNICEF, said: \"The nutrition situation for children in Afghanistan is very serious and the numbers speak for themselves. Over 3.5 million children under five are acutely malnourished, including 1.4 million suffering life-threatening forms of wasting. \"It must be clear to everyone: when funding drops as we are seeing it now in a context with such high levels of malnutrition, preventable child deaths rise.\" A vital lifeline  In rural areas, poverty is as extreme as the landscape, and help for families with malnourished children is getting harder to reach. Layaba Health Clinic is a vital lifeline. The waiting room is full of mothers looking for medical assistance for their babies. Some women here tell us the Taliban's restrictions on them working and earning money have also played a part, making it harder for them to feed their families. \"They are to blame,\" one woman says with surprising candor. \"Every girl had her own dreams. I wanted to be a doctor. I took my responsibility for my children seriously. And I wanted to support my husband too.\" Another woman tells us she earned more than her husband as a teacher, but now finds herself unable to contribute financially. The Taliban's response  In an exclusive interview with Sky News, the Talibanâ€™s spokesman, Zabihullah Mujahid, said the malnutrition crisis was the product of decades of conflict. \"We have had to start from zero to rebuild and restore our national resources. The Islamic Emirate is making every possible effort to address these challenges.\" Mr Mujahid said his government had a five-year plan to \"tackle malnutrition, unemployment, and other pressing social issues\". In response to the complaints of the women we spoke to, he said that men in the \"vast majority\" of Afghan families were the breadwinners and claimed the Islamic Emirate had made \"significant efforts to promote vocational opportunities for women\". But under the Taliban, women can no longer train to be doctors, nurses and midwives. And in remote villages, community workers like Harira are often the only lifeline - a project part-funded by UNICEF. She goes door-to-door carrying baby scales, carrying out check-ups, trying to teach families about what to feed their children and when needed, get them to clinics and hospitals for treatment. It saved Ramzia's son's life. She had measles when she was pregnant and her son Faisal was very underweight. \"His legs and hands were as small as my fingers. Now he's much better,\" Harira says - beaming as she delights in the weight he has now put on. \"I was afraid I'd lose him,\" Ramzia says. \"He was so weak. But Harira came here and taught me how to feed him and give him milk when he needed it.\" Read more:Families fear months ahead after earthquake wiped out entire villagesTaliban internet blackout has created an extreme scenario Reeling from death, fighting for life  Keeping children alive in this climate is a battle. Nasrullah and Jamilah, who live on the outskirts of Fayzabad, are holding their two-month-old twins. But they're also in the throes of grief - on a journey to the grave of the baby they lost only a month ago. Her name was Shukriya. She was 18 months old. \"She was our child, we loved her. I will never forget her, so long as I'm alive. We really tried, we went to the doctors for check-ups, for ultrasounds, for blood work - we tried our very best. But none of it could save her.\" Both parents say they feared their twins could also face the same fate. Shukriya's grave is covered with one of her babygrows. It is haunting to see. And there are other little graves next to hers. Deaths aren't documented in a lot of these communities. But locals tell us more and more children are dying because of malnutrition. A silent, searing loss that is spreading."

        "Content": " Donald Trump has raised the pressure ahead of Monday's peace talks, urging negotiators to \"move fast\" as they attempt to end the fighting in Gaza and secure the release of hostages. The US president posted on Truth Social: \"TIME IS OF THE ESSENCE OR, MASSIVE BLOODSHED WILL FOLLOW - SOMETHING THAT NOBODY WANTS TO SEE!\" Egypt has agreed to host delegations from Israel and Hamas. An Israeli delegation led by strategic affairs minister Ron Dermer will attend the indirect negotiations in the Red Sea resort of Sharm el-Sheikh. US envoy Steve Witkoff is also expected to join. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said he hopes to announce the release of hostages being held in Gaza \"in the coming days\" and Hamas announced on Friday it would return all remaining hostages in Gaza, dead and alive. The group also said in a statement that it wants to engage in negotiations to discuss further points in the US president's peace plan. Speaking to our US partner network NBC, Donald Trump's secretary of state Marco Rubio said Hamas had also agreed \"in principle\" to what happens after the war in Gaza is over, but he warned the second phase of the deal, which concerns Hamas's disarmament and demobilisation, was \"not going to be easy\". \n                  Netanyahu backs Trump's peace plan for Gaza - as role for Blair revealed\n                 \n                  Destruction of Gaza's al-Quds hospital seen by nurse whose colleagues tell her 'they are going to die'\n                 \n                  Netanyahu is famous for wriggling out of impossible predicaments - but this may be his biggest test yet\n                 \"We'll know very quickly whether Hamas is serious or not by how these technical talks go in terms of the logistics,\" Mr Rubio added. On Sunday, Mr Trump posted that there had been \"very positive discussions with Hamas... to release the Hostages, end the War in Gaza but, more importantly, finally have long sought PEACE in the Middle East\". \"I am told that the first phase should be completed this week, and I am asking everyone to MOVE FAST,\" he added. The first phase deals with the release of hostages in exchange for the release of Palestinian prisoners. Progress in the discussions in Cairo will largely depend on whether the militant group agrees to Washington's withdrawal map, a Palestinian official close to the talks told Reuters. Mr Trump released a map showing the areas of Gaza the Israeli Defence Forces would need to withdraw its troops from, which he said had been agreed to already by Israel. Currently, the Israeli military has covered around 80% of the enclave in what it calls a \"dangerous combat zone\". If the peace plan follows the boundaries shown on the map, Israel's initial withdrawal would leave Gaza about 55% occupied, while the second withdrawal would leave it about 40% occupied. After the final withdrawal phase, which would create a \"security buffer zone\", about 15% of Gaza would be occupied by the Israeli military. It is this part - as well as the peace plan proposal for an international group to manage Gaza - \"that is going to be a little tougher to work through,\" Mr Rubio added. Calls for ceasefire Meanwhile, international support for an immediate ceasefire is growing. On Friday, Mr Trump told Israel to \"stop bombing Gaza\", and on Sunday Pope Leo renewed calls for a permanent ceasefire in the nearly two-year conflict. This was followed by the foreign ministers of eight Muslim-majority countries issuing a joint statement urging steps toward a possible end to fighting. In backing Hamas' willingness to hand over the running of Gaza to a transitional committee, the ministers called for an \"immediate launch of negotiations to agree on mechanisms to implement the proposal\". They also underlined their commitment to the return of the Palestinian Authority to Gaza, unifying Gaza and the West Bank, and reaching an agreement on security leading to a \"full Israeli withdrawal\" from Gaza. Read more:Why Trump accepted the Hamas peace plan responseIf Hamas and Israel agree a deal, it will be Trump's success  Israeli government spokeswoman Shosh Bedrosian told journalists: \"While certain bombings have actually stopped inside of the Gaza Strip, there's no ceasefire in place at this point in time.\" She said Mr Netanyahu is in \"regular contact\" with Mr Trump and that the prime minister has stressed talks in Egypt \"will be confined to a few days maximum, with no tolerance for manoeuvres that will delay talks by Hamas\". Residents and local hospitals said strikes continued across the Gaza Strip over the weekend. At least eight people were killed on Sunday in multiple strikes in the city, according to the Shifa hospital, which received the casualties. Half of them were killed in a strike that hit a group of people in Gaza City, the hospital said.  Four people also were killed in a shooting near an aid distribution site in the southern city of Rafah, according to Nasser hospital. The Israeli military said it was not involved in the shooting and did not immediately comment on the strikes. \"We're on the brink, and we don't know whether one will die of a strike or starvation,\" said Mahmoud Hashem, a Palestinian father of five, who is forced to shelter in a tent in the centre of Gaza City. When will hostages be freed? A lawyer representing the families of Israeli hostages held in Gaza has told Sky News now feels \"as good a chance as any\" to finally get the remaining captives out. Adam Wagner said hostage families were facing \"a huge mix of emotions\" as they awaited the latest developments in Mr Trump's 20-point peace plan. ðŸ‘‰Listen to The World with Richard Engel and Yalda Hakim on your podcast appðŸ‘ˆ \"We've seen hopes raised and the talks fail a number of times, but this seems as good a chance as any to get those 48 remaining hostages out,\" he said. Mr Wagner also agreed the \"big question\" for the talks was whether Hamas would agree to full disarmament and complete removal from the administration of Gaza. Israel estimates 48 hostages remain in Gaza, 20 of whom are alive."

Speaking at the Conservative Friends of Israel (CFoI) reception at the party conference in Manchester, Sharren Haskel hit out at Sir Keir Starmer's government for the decision to recognise Palestine, for \"out of control\" immigration that she said is changing the country and the rise of antisemitism in Britain.

Labour is complicit in the appalling abuse we see across our streets and across Britain's Jewish community,\" she said. \n                  Shadow chancellor to pledge further cuts to foreign aid - as Tories vow to 'stand up for fiscal responsibility'\n                 \n                  Kemi praises Thatcher but faces fight with grandees\n                 \n                  A subdued Tory conference could be a chance for Badenoch to turn her fortunes around - but will she?\n                  Sharren Haskel was full of praise for the Conservative Party, and Ms Badenoch's consistent support for her country. But in an excoriating attack on the Labour government, Ms Haskell questioned what it is going to do about the \"tsunami of Jew hatred and violence on Britain's streets that has exploded since the worst massacre of Jews since the Holocaust\". She also attacked the government's decision to recognise Palestine - a decision in which he played a leading role - as a \"grotesque betrayal of truth, of justice and of Britain's Jewish community\". She said it was no surprise that Deputy Prime Minister David Lammy was booed when he spoke at a vigil for the victims of the Manchester synagogue terror attack a few days ago.  Read more from Sky News:Badenoch: Streets are 'theatres of intimidation'Analysis: Labour under pressure over protestsAttack 'sadly something we feared was coming' Ms Haskell went further in attacking the government, criticising \"out of control immigration, particularly from Islamist communities hostile to your values\". \"It is fueling antisemitism on your street. It is straining your social cohesion. It is importing the demonisation of Jews and the hatred of the Middle East into British cities,\" added the Israeli deputy foreign minister. She closed with a rallying call to the attendees to not \"surrender\" to a \"woke agenda\" and be proud of their British and English heritage. Sky News has asked CCHQ why Kemi Badenoch did not attend the reception. The Tory leader has been highly vocal in her support for Israel and the Jewish community. She met the deputy foreign minister earlier on Sunday, and visited the scene of Thursday's terror attack at a Manchester synagogue before the conference began."

        "Content": "At least five people have been killed in a massive Russian missile and drone attack on Ukraine, Volodymyr Zelenskyy has said. The Ukrainian president said Russia launched more than 50 missiles and around 500 attack drones - with the regions of Lviv, Ivano-Frankivsk, Zaporizhzhia, Chernihiv, Sumy, Kharkiv, Kherson, Odesa, and Kirovohrad all targeted. Four people were reportedly killed in the western region of Lviv, which borders Poland, where an industrial park was set ablaze. One person in the southeastern region of Zaporizhzhia was killed, the region's governor said. Mr Zelenskyy said around 10 people were also injured in the strikes. Many civilians have also been left without power, including more than 73,000 in Zaporizhzhia. Russia, which has not commented on the attack, has stepped up strikes on Ukraine's energy grid in recent weeks as winter approaches. Kyiv's energy ministry said the Russian strike damaged equipment at an energy company that serves people in Zaporizhzhia and the Chernihiv region is suffering from hourly power outages. Mr Zelenskyy said: \"The Russians once again targeted our infrastructure - everything that ensures normal life for our people. \"We need more protection and faster implementation of all defence agreements, especially on air defence, to deprive this aerial terror of any meaning. \"A unilateral ceasefire in the skies is possible - and it is precisely that which could open the way to real diplomacy. \"America and Europe must act to make Putin stop.\" Russia launched a massive bombardment on Ukraine's gas production facilities earlier this week. On Friday, Ukraine's natural gas facilities run by the state-owned Naftogaz Group also suffered the biggest attack since the war started in February 2022. Poland scrambles aircraft Poland's armed forces were forced to scramble jets to protect its airspace during the attack by Russia on Ukraine. \"Polish and allied aircraft are operating in our airspace, while ground-based air defence and radar reconnaissance systems have been brought to the highest state of readiness,\" Poland's operational command said in a post on X.  Lithuania's airport in Vilnius was closed for several hours overnight after reports of a possible series of balloons heading towards the airport late on Saturday. The country's public broadcaster LRT cited the head of the country's National Crisis Management as saying that 13 balloons were heading towards the country's busiest airport. It was not immediately clear who launched the balloons or what type they were. Around 30 flights and nearly 6,000 passengers were impacted by the temporary restrictions.

        "Content": "A shake-up to the house-buying system which could cut a month off the time it takes - and slash around Â£700 from the moving bill - is on the table. Changes could include requiring property sellers and estate agents to provide more information when a home is listed for sale, reducing the need for buyers to carry out searches and surveys. Binding contracts could also be introduced at an earlier stage, reducing the risk of a chain collapsing. The proposals could also deliver clearer information to consumers about estate agents and conveyancers, including their track record and expertise, along with new mandatory qualifications and a code of practice to drive up standards. Housing Secretary Steve Reed said the proposals, which are the subject of a consultation, would help make \"a simple dream, a simple reality\". The government says it will set out a full roadmap in the new year after consulting on its proposals. Mr Reed said: \"Buying a home should be a dream, not a nightmare. \n                  Crunching the numbers behind Labour's pledge to build 180,000 new social homes\n                 \n                  Labour needs to focus on the working class, says Andy BurnhamÂ \n                 \n                  Children facing housing insecurity less likely to pass GCSEs, research shows\n                 \"Our reforms will fix the broken system so hardworking people can focus on the next chapter of their lives.\" Officials believe the proposed package of reforms could cut around a month off the time it takes to buy a new home and save first-time buyers an average of Â£710. People selling a home could face increased costs of around Â£310 due to the inclusion of upfront assessments and surveys. Those in the middle of a chain would potentially gain a net saving of Â£400 as a result of the increased costs from selling being outweighed by lower buying expenses. Wider use of online processes, including digital ID, could help make transactions smoother, the government argued, pointing to the Finnish digital real estate system which can see the process completed in around two weeks. The consultation also draws on other jurisdictions, including the Scottish system where there is more upfront information and earlier binding contracts. 'Process the same as for our grandparents' The planned shake-up was welcomed by property websites and lenders. Rightmove chief executive Johan Svanstrom said: \"The home-moving process involves many fragmented parts, and there's simply too much uncertainty and costs along the way. \"Speed, connected data and stakeholder simplicity should be key goals. We believe it's important to listen to agents as the experts for what practical changes will be most effective, and we look forward to working with the government on this effort to improve the buying and selling process.\" Santander's head of homes David Morris said: \"At a time when technology has changed many processes in our lives, it is incredible that the process of buying a home - an activity that is a cornerstone of our economy - remains much the same for today's buyers as it did for their grandparents.\" Conservative shadow housing minister Paul Holmes said that while Labour welcomed steps to digitise and speed up the process, the party risked \"reinventing the last Labour government's failed Home Information Packs - which reduced the number of homes put on sale, and duplicated costs across buyers and sellers\"."

Sky News has learnt that the chancellor and Lucy Rigby, the newly appointed City minister, will host a group of company bosses on Monday to discuss \"the UK IPO environment\", according to a copy of the invitation.

Money blog: How to spot a nightmare neighbour before you buy a house Mr Gutman is one of the City's leading investment bankers, and now holds a senior global role in that division of the Wall Street bank. He has worked on many of the UK's largest takeover deals and initial public offerings since he joined Goldman about 20 years ago.

Shawbrook Group, whose intention to float was revealed by this channel earlier in the year, is expected to publicly confirm its plans as soon as this week. One source said the chancellor could use Monday's meeting as an opportunity to address questions about a possible stamp duty exemption for newly listed shares, which the Financial Times reported last week was under consideration by Treasury officials. London has slipped behind numerous rival financial centres in terms of the proceeds raised from IPOs, while the decision of major companies including AstraZeneca to upgrade their US listings has cast further doubt on the City's relative appeal.

        "Content": "By Ben Bloch, political reporter, at Conservative Party conference in Manchester  The Tories will pledge to make even further cuts to the foreign aid budget, as the party attempts to regain its reputation for fiscal responsibility in the wake of the Truss mini-budget. Shadow chancellor Sir Mel Stride will unveil plans to cut overseas development aid to 0.1% of Gross National Income (GNI), down from the current 0.3%, cementing a sea change in the Conservative Party's position on international aid. In his keynote speech to the party conference in Manchester, Sir Mel will claim that his plans can save Â£47bn over the next parliament, which include cuts to welfare, the civil service, and green subsidies. In the wake of the Truss mini-budget that saw the pound fall and interest rates soar, the senior MP will say that his party will \"never, ever make fiscal commitments without spelling out exactly how they will be paid for\", and commit to fiscal responsibility. A key part of Sir Mel's plans to demonstrate that is to reduce foreign aid to 0.1% of GNI, or around Â£3bn per year - down from spending of an estimated Â£9.4bn in 2028-29. The Boris Johnson government reduced aid spending to 0.5% of GNI in 2021, in order to pay for the vast public spending during the pandemic. Sir Keir Starmer announced a further cut to 0.3% of GNI earlier this year to pay for the increase in defence spending. Bond, the network for organisations working in international development and humanitarian assistance, has hit out at the announcement, describing it as \"reckless, short-sighted, and morally indefensible\". \n                  Israeli minister Sharren Haskel attacks Labour's 'grotesque betrayal' of Jewish community\n                 \n                  Kemi praises Thatcher but faces fight with grandees\n                 \n                  A subdued Tory conference could be a chance for Badenoch to turn her fortunes around - but will she?\n                 Its chief executive, Romilly Greenhill, told Conservatives at a fringe event at the Tory Party conference on Sunday: \"Let's just be really clear, such a policy would negatively impact millions of people around the world. \"It would harm deeply vital programmes being made in reducing, eradicating, killer diseases, and it would also severely undermine our ability to respond to devastating global crises.\"  But the Tories say they \"cannot justify taxing people in this country to pay for billions of spending abroad\", and it marks the death-knell of Tory former prime minister David Cameron's target of spending 0.7% of GNI on aid, announced in 2011. Welfare, green subsidies, and asylum hotels to face the chop Another key area where Sir Mel will pledge to make savings will be the welfare system, where they claim Â£23bn can be cut. He will say that narrowing the eligibility for sickness benefits, stopping claims from people with \"low-level mental health problems\" who could be treated instead, limiting the VAT subsidy for Motability, and reforming job-seeking obligations are key areas where savings can be made. But a major change will be restricting welfare to British citizens - bringing Tory party policy in line with Reform UK. But he will vow to reverse any decision from the current Labour government to lift the two-child benefit cap, which stands in contrast with Nigel Farage's party that wants to lift it. Sir Mel is expected to say the reforms are essential not just for balancing the books, but for tackling the deeper social damage caused by long-term dependency.  Another key target of the shadow chancellor is the civil service, where he will argue that Â£8bn in savings can be made by reducing the headcount from 517,000 down to 2016 levels of 384,000. Scrapping the Climate Change Act and \"costly and ineffective green subsidies being pushed by Ed Miliband\" is also on Sir Mel's agenda. The Tories say there are savings of Â£1.6bn a year to be made in this area. And closing all asylum hotels will save at least Â£3.5bn, the Tories say - at least Â£1.6bn of which they have already allocated to their new ICE-style \"removals force\", to detain and remove 150,000 illegal migrants per year. In his speech, Sir Mel Stride MP is expected to say: \"The Conservative Party will never, ever make fiscal commitments without spelling out exactly how they will be paid for. \"We're the only party that gets it. The only party that will stand up for fiscal responsibility. We must get on top of government spending. \"We cannot deliver stability unless we live within our means. No more pretending we can keep spending money we simply do not have.\"  ðŸ‘‰Listen to Politics at Sam and Anne's on your podcast appðŸ‘ˆ 'Trussonomics is still in full swing' But Labour Party chair Anna Turley said: \"The Tories let welfare bills, civil service numbers and asylum hotel use skyrocket on their watch - and they've never apologised. Now they want to rehash failed promises from their failed manifesto to try to solve the problems they caused. \"This is the same old Tories, with the same old policies. They didn't work then and you can't trust them now.\" And Liberal Democrat Treasury spokeswoman Daisy Cooper said it was \"clear the Conservative Party learnt absolutely nothing from their disastrous handling of the economy, which left families struggling with a cost-of-living crisis and public services on their knees\". She added: \"Cutting vital support to bring household bills down, trying to balance the books on the backs of people with mental health conditions and slashing the UK's soft power abroad through aid budget cuts shows Trussonomics is still in full swing.\""

More widely, Heidi claims to have supported more than 70 million patient consultations globally over the last 18 months, returning more than 18 million hours to frontline clinicians by streamlining administrative functions. \"It is untenable that healthcare demand continues to rise while clinical time continues to shrink,\" Dr Thomas Kelly, the CEO and co-founder of Heidi, said. \"Building a sustainable healthcare system requires expanding clinical capacity without compromising clinician wellbeing or patient safety.\" The new funding will be used to accelerate Heidi's expansion in the US, UK and Canada, including doubling its workforce in Britain to meet growing NHS demand.

Speaking just days after a terror attack at a synagogue in the city left two people dead, the Tory leader claimed extremism \"has gone unchecked\" in the UK. Politics live: Government grants police new powers in crackdown on repeat protests She said this had manifested in Pro-Palestine protests which are \"in fact carnivals of hatred directed at the Jewish homeland\". She cited the use of \"asinine slogans\" such as 'Globalise the Intifada', saying this \"means nothing at all, if it doesn't mean targeting Jewish people for violence\".  Ms Badenoch added: \"So the message from this conference, from this party, from every decent and right-thinking person in this country must be that we will not stand for it any more. We cannot import and tolerate values hostile to our own. \"We must now draw a line and say that in Britain you can think what you like, and within the bounds of the law you can say what you like, but you have no right to turn our streets into the theatres of intimidation and we will not let you do so any more.\" \n                  Shadow chancellor to pledge further cuts to foreign aid - as Tories vow to 'stand up for fiscal responsibility'\n                 \n                  Kemi praises Thatcher but faces fight with grandees\n                 \n                  Israeli minister Sharren Haskel attacks Labour's 'grotesque betrayal' of Jewish community\n                 Ms Badenoch has said she supports the government's efforts to impose restrictions on repeat protests in light of the Manchester terror attack. Nearly 500 people were arrested over protests supporting the proscribed group Palestine Action in central London on Saturday. Demonstrators defied calls from political leaders, including Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer, to reconsider the event out of respect for the grief of the British Jewish community. The chief of the Metropolitan Police, Sir Mark Rowley, also called for the event to be postponed, saying he was worried resources would be stretched and the ability of the force to protect communities would be compromised. ECHR plan 'not vague mush' Elsewhere in her speech, Ms Badenoch spoke about her policy to leave the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) and carry out \"ICE-style\" deportations if she wins the next election.  She said that shadow Northern Ireland Secretary Alex Burghart will lead a review into a union-wide implementation of leaving the ECHR, so voters have \"a clear, thorough and robust plan, not the vague mush that we see day in, day out from Labour, nor the vacuous posturing that we see day in, day out from Reform\". The plan has been condemned by Former Conservative justice secretary and Lord Chancellor Robert Buckland, who lost his seat at the 2024 election. Read More:Active plot against Kemi Badenoch at this party conference in Manchester \"I have seen first-hand how deeply this issue touches our constitution, our Union, and our international standing. It would be a profound mistake to go down this path,\" he wrote in an article for Conservative Home. The comments reflect how the issue has long divided the party, with \"one nation\" moderates like Mr Buckland opposed to the idea of leaving the ECHR, and others seeing it as necessary to get a grip on illegal migration and tackle Reform UK. In a sign she won't shy away from that fight, Ms Badenoch told GB News earlier that every Conservative candidate must sign up to her plan to leave the ECHR, or they would be barred from standing at the next election. 'Mountain to climb' The Tories are languishing in the polls behind Reform and Labour after suffering their worst-ever defeat at the election last year. Ms Badenoch, who was elected to lead the party last November, ended her speech acknowledging there was a \"mountain to climb\" but insisting she was up for the fight. \"Britain needs deep change. But I reject the politics that everything must go, that everything must be torn down, that everything is broken,\" she said. \"If we leave it to Labour or Reform, Britain will be divided. Only the Conservatives can bring this country back together. \"So, I say to you all as we start our conference, yes, we have a mountain to climb, but we have a song in our hearts, and we are up for the fight.\""

        "Content": "By Ben Bloch, political reporter, at Conservative Party conference in Manchester  The Tories will pledge to make even further cuts to the foreign aid budget, as the party attempts to regain its reputation for fiscal responsibility in the wake of the Truss mini-budget. Shadow chancellor Sir Mel Stride will unveil plans to cut overseas development aid to 0.1% of Gross National Income (GNI), down from the current 0.3%, cementing a sea change in the Conservative Party's position on international aid. In his keynote speech to the party conference in Manchester, Sir Mel will claim that his plans can save Â£47bn over the next parliament, which include cuts to welfare, the civil service, and green subsidies. In the wake of the Truss mini-budget that saw the pound fall and interest rates soar, the senior MP will say that his party will \"never, ever make fiscal commitments without spelling out exactly how they will be paid for\", and commit to fiscal responsibility. A key part of Sir Mel's plans to demonstrate that is to reduce foreign aid to 0.1% of GNI, or around Â£3bn per year - down from spending of an estimated Â£9.4bn in 2028-29. The Boris Johnson government reduced aid spending to 0.5% of GNI in 2021, in order to pay for the vast public spending during the pandemic. Sir Keir Starmer announced a further cut to 0.3% of GNI earlier this year to pay for the increase in defence spending. Bond, the network for organisations working in international development and humanitarian assistance, has hit out at the announcement, describing it as \"reckless, short-sighted, and morally indefensible\". \n                  Israeli minister Sharren Haskel attacks Labour's 'grotesque betrayal' of Jewish community\n                 \n                  Kemi praises Thatcher but faces fight with grandees\n                 \n                  A subdued Tory conference could be a chance for Badenoch to turn her fortunes around - but will she?\n                 Its chief executive, Romilly Greenhill, told Conservatives at a fringe event at the Tory Party conference on Sunday: \"Let's just be really clear, such a policy would negatively impact millions of people around the world. \"It would harm deeply vital programmes being made in reducing, eradicating, killer diseases, and it would also severely undermine our ability to respond to devastating global crises.\"  But the Tories say they \"cannot justify taxing people in this country to pay for billions of spending abroad\", and it marks the death-knell of Tory former prime minister David Cameron's target of spending 0.7% of GNI on aid, announced in 2011. Welfare, green subsidies, and asylum hotels to face the chop Another key area where Sir Mel will pledge to make savings will be the welfare system, where they claim Â£23bn can be cut. He will say that narrowing the eligibility for sickness benefits, stopping claims from people with \"low-level mental health problems\" who could be treated instead, limiting the VAT subsidy for Motability, and reforming job-seeking obligations are key areas where savings can be made. But a major change will be restricting welfare to British citizens - bringing Tory party policy in line with Reform UK. But he will vow to reverse any decision from the current Labour government to lift the two-child benefit cap, which stands in contrast with Nigel Farage's party that wants to lift it. Sir Mel is expected to say the reforms are essential not just for balancing the books, but for tackling the deeper social damage caused by long-term dependency.  Another key target of the shadow chancellor is the civil service, where he will argue that Â£8bn in savings can be made by reducing the headcount from 517,000 down to 2016 levels of 384,000. Scrapping the Climate Change Act and \"costly and ineffective green subsidies being pushed by Ed Miliband\" is also on Sir Mel's agenda. The Tories say there are savings of Â£1.6bn a year to be made in this area. And closing all asylum hotels will save at least Â£3.5bn, the Tories say - at least Â£1.6bn of which they have already allocated to their new ICE-style \"removals force\", to detain and remove 150,000 illegal migrants per year. In his speech, Sir Mel Stride MP is expected to say: \"The Conservative Party will never, ever make fiscal commitments without spelling out exactly how they will be paid for. \"We're the only party that gets it. The only party that will stand up for fiscal responsibility. We must get on top of government spending. \"We cannot deliver stability unless we live within our means. No more pretending we can keep spending money we simply do not have.\"  ðŸ‘‰Listen to Politics at Sam and Anne's on your podcast appðŸ‘ˆ 'Trussonomics is still in full swing' But Labour Party chair Anna Turley said: \"The Tories let welfare bills, civil service numbers and asylum hotel use skyrocket on their watch - and they've never apologised. Now they want to rehash failed promises from their failed manifesto to try to solve the problems they caused. \"This is the same old Tories, with the same old policies. They didn't work then and you can't trust them now.\" And Liberal Democrat Treasury spokeswoman Daisy Cooper said it was \"clear the Conservative Party learnt absolutely nothing from their disastrous handling of the economy, which left families struggling with a cost-of-living crisis and public services on their knees\". She added: \"Cutting vital support to bring household bills down, trying to balance the books on the backs of people with mental health conditions and slashing the UK's soft power abroad through aid budget cuts shows Trussonomics is still in full swing.\""

        "Content": "\n          Chief political correspondent\n              @joncraig\n Just days before the 100th anniversary of the birth of Margaret Thatcher, on 13 October, Kemi Badenoch opened the Conservative conference by twice praising the party's heroine and three-time election winner. \"The facts of life are Conservative,\" the Tory leader declared, quoting the former PM, before praising her for breaking the cycle of high inflation, low growth and the stranglehold of the trade unions in the 1980s. But as her rather flat delivery in her 28-minute opening speech confirmed, Ms Badenoch is no Margaret Thatcher. (Perhaps she needs a voice coach, like Mrs T, who was transformed by tutoring from Gordon Reece in her early days as Tory leader.) For lovers of political trivia, however, Kemi and Maggie do have one thing in common. Both met their husbands when they were fighting a Labour seat before becoming an MP. The dashing Denis Thatcher famously gave Margaret a lift back to London from Dartford, where she was candidate in 1950 and 1951, in his Jaguar sports car. \n                  Israeli minister Sharren Haskel attacks Labour's 'grotesque betrayal' of Jewish community\n                 \n                  Shadow chancellor to pledge further cuts to foreign aid - as Tories vow to 'stand up for fiscal responsibility'\n                 \n                  A subdued Tory conference could be a chance for Badenoch to turn her fortunes around - but will she?\n                 Some 60 years later, banker Hamish Badenoch, a former head boy at Ampleforth school - the Roman Catholic boarding school run by monks - gave Kemi lifts in his car when she was candidate against Labour's Tessa Jowell in Dulwich and West Norwood in the 2010 general election. Sadly, Margaret Thatcher saw several acts of terrorism at close hand - the 1984 Brighton bomb being the most devastating example - and here Kemi Badenoch's speech began with solemn references to the Manchester synagogue attack. She entered the hall to almost funereal music and her tone was solemn, before she launched into a fierce attack on the weekend's pro-Palestine protests, which the prime minister and home secretary had urged organisers to call off. These marches were \"carnivals of hate\" and \"theatres of intimidation\", she declared, in an attack that rather overshadowed her much-trailed announcement of quitting the European Convention of Human Rights and plans to deport 150,000 illegal migrants a year.  The ECHR announcement did bring the rather subdued 1,000-strong audience to life, however, and they also applauded when she attacked Nigel Farage's controversial plan to axe indefinite leave to remain status for migrants legally living in the UK. \"I am British, as we all are,\" she said. \"My children are British, and I will not allow anyone on the left to tell them that they belong in a different category, or anyone on the right to tell them that they do not belong in their own country.\" To be fair, the sombre mood just days after the Manchester synagogue deaths meant this was not the time for a knockabout speech from the Tory leader. That will come on Wednesday when she makes the final speech of this conference. But before then, her leadership and her policies won't go unchallenged.  Shortly before she was praising Margaret Thatcher in her speech, there was a rumour that one of Mrs T's most devoted Tory MP fans, the Romford MP Andrew Rosindell, was being courted by Reform UK as a potential defector and was poised to jump. \"What would Mrs T say?\" Sky News asked Rosindell, who's such a devotee that his Romford Tory HQ was officially opened by his heroine and is called Margaret Thatcher House. He replied: \"Mrs T would not believe all she read on Twitter. Fortunately, there was no social media in those days.\" So was that a yes or a no? \"No,\" he replied, adding: \"If I decide to defect to the Lib Dems you'll be the first to know.\" What a tease! ðŸ‘‰Tap here to follow Politics At Sam And Anne's on your podcast appðŸ‘ˆ And as the Conservative party prepares to celebrate the Thatcher anniversary, who should turn up in Manchester but the big beast who did more to bring her down in 1990 than any other Tory politician. Michael Heseltine, now 92 and once the darling of Tory activists and the party's favourite blond apart from Margaret Thatcher, is due to address a European Movement fringe meeting, where he will no doubt denounce Kemi's plan to bin the ECHR. The woman dubbed KemiKaze by her critics ended her speech by claiming the Conservatives are \"up for the fight\". Unfortunately, her ECHR plan may provoke a fight with big beasts and grandees like Michael Heseltine in her own party. But on the evidence so far, and given her claim in her speech that the party has changed, she's up for the fight with the grandees too."

Speaking at the Conservative Friends of Israel (CFoI) reception at the party conference in Manchester, Sharren Haskel hit out at Sir Keir Starmer's government for the decision to recognise Palestine, for \"out of control\" immigration that she said is changing the country and the rise of antisemitism in Britain. It was hoped that Tory leader Kemi Badenoch would attend the annual event, as her predecessors Rishi Sunak and Liz Truss did, and there was widespread surprise that she did not appear. Tory Party conference: Badenoch on Manchester synagogue attack One attendee told Sky News they were \"really surprised\" that she did not make remarks, and another said that in the chaotic years in government, they \"had about five leaders and they all showed up\".  But speeches were given by shadow cabinet ministers Sir James Cleverly, Chris Philp, Lord David Wolfson, along with shadow foreign secretary Dame Priti Patel who attacked Labour's \"dreadful decisions\". \"They [Labour] have lost any moral purpose whatsoever. Labour is complicit in the appalling abuse we see across our streets and across Britain's Jewish community,\" she said. \n                  Shadow chancellor to pledge further cuts to foreign aid - as Tories vow to 'stand up for fiscal responsibility'\n                 \n                  Kemi praises Thatcher but faces fight with grandees\n                 \n                  A subdued Tory conference could be a chance for Badenoch to turn her fortunes around - but will she?\n                  Sharren Haskel was full of praise for the Conservative Party, and Ms Badenoch's consistent support for her country. But in an excoriating attack on the Labour government, Ms Haskell questioned what it is going to do about the \"tsunami of Jew hatred and violence on Britain's streets that has exploded since the worst massacre of Jews since the Holocaust\". She also attacked the government's decision to recognise Palestine - a decision in which he played a leading role - as a \"grotesque betrayal of truth, of justice and of Britain's Jewish community\". She said it was no surprise that Deputy Prime Minister David Lammy was booed when he spoke at a vigil for the victims of the Manchester synagogue terror attack a few days ago.  Read more from Sky News:Badenoch: Streets are 'theatres of intimidation'Analysis: Labour under pressure over protestsAttack 'sadly something we feared was coming' Ms Haskell went further in attacking the government, criticising \"out of control immigration, particularly from Islamist communities hostile to your values\". \"It is fueling antisemitism on your street. It is straining your social cohesion. It is importing the demonisation of Jews and the hatred of the Middle East into British cities,\" added the Israeli deputy foreign minister. She closed with a rallying call to the attendees to not \"surrender\" to a \"woke agenda\" and be proud of their British and English heritage. Sky News has asked CCHQ why Kemi Badenoch did not attend the reception. The Tory leader has been highly vocal in her support for Israel and the Jewish community. She met the deputy foreign minister earlier on Sunday, and visited the scene of Thursday's terror attack at a Manchester synagogue before the conference began."

Shabana Mahmood told Sky News' Sunday Morning with Trevor Phillips that the changes, announced earlier in the day, would allow communities to \"go about their daily business without feeling intimidated\". Politics Live: Conservative party conference gets under way It follows the arrests of nearly 500 people during demonstrations in support of the proscribed group Palestine Action in central London on Saturday. Protesters defied calls to rethink the event in the wake of the Manchester synagogue terror attack on Thursday, in which two Jewish worshippers were killed. The new powers will allow police forces to consider the \"cumulative impact\" of protests, assessing previous activity, when deciding to impose limits on protesters. The limits that could be imposed include moving demonstrators to a different place or \"restricting the time that those protests can occur\", Ms Mahmood said. She added: \"It's been clear to me in conversations in the last couple of days that there is a gap in the law and there is an inconsistency of practice. \"So I'll be taking measures immediately to put that right and I will be reviewing our wider protest legislation as well, to make sure the arrangements we have can meet the scale of the challenge that we face.\" The changes will be made through amendments to the Public Order Act, and anyone who breaches the new conditions will risk arrest and prosecution. 'More flexibility to prevent disruptive protests' The home secretary has written to chief constables in England and Wales to explain the new powers. She wrote: \"The government will bring forward legislation to increase the powers available to you to tackle the repeated disruptive protests we have seen and continue to provide the reassurance to communities that they need. \"Through upcoming legislation, we will amend sections 12 and 14 of the Public Order Act 1986 to allow senior officers to consider the cumulative impact of protests on local communities when they are imposing conditions on public processions and assemblies. \"This will allow you more flexibility to prevent disruptive protests from attending the same location and instruct organisers to move to a different site.\" The Greens and the Lib Dems said it was an attack on the right to protest. Green Party leader Zack Polanski told Sky News: \"Giving police sweeping powers to shut down protests because of their 'cumulative impact' is a cynical assault on the right to dissent. The whole point of protest is persistence; that's how change happens. Do you think the suffragettes protested once and then gave up?\" Lib Dem home affairs spokesman Max Wilkinson said this will \"do nothing\" to tackle antisemitism \"while undermining the fundamental right to peaceful protest\". Earlier, Ms Mahmood said the right to protest was a \"fundamental freedom\" but this must be balanced \"with the freedom of their neighbours to live their lives without fear\". In a statement she said: \"Large, repeated protests can leave sections of our country, particularly religious communities, feeling unsafe, intimidated and scared to leave their homes.â€¯ \"This has been particularly evident in relation to the considerable fear within the Jewish community, which has been expressed to me on many occasions in these recent difficult days. \"These changes mark an important step in ensuring we protect the right to protest while ensuring all feel safe in this country.\" Tories 'will support' measures Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch said her party will \"of course support\" the new measures but asked why it took \"so long\" for them to be introduced. Speaking to the BBC's Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg, she claimed that what happened in Manchester was foreseeable and not enough has been done to address fears over safety in the Jewish community. Ms Mahmood addressed the Jewish communities' concerns after being shown a clip of deputy prime minister David Lammy being heckled at a vigil on Friday.   She told Sky News' Trevor Phillips the government \"of course\" hears their strength of feeling and is \"committed to dealing with antisemitism in all of its forms\", pointing to the \"strengthening\" of police powers announced today. Asked if the reaction to Mr Lammy reflected anger at the government's decision to recognise a Palestine state, she said it was important not to \"elide\" Thursday's attack with the situation in the Middle East. \"People are entitled to their views and of course we were there to hear those views. What I would say is that the attack that took place, the person that's responsible for that attack is the attacker himself,\" she said. \"And, of course, four other people are in custody and the police investigation does need to take its course. It's important that we don't elide that into the wider questions of what's going on in the Middle East.\""

        "Content": "\n          Deputy political editor\n              @SamCoatesSky\n  Make no mistake. There is an active plot against Kemi Badenoch at this party conference in Manchester. The leadership will never be entirely sure which mishaps, bad stories and unfortunate events are the consequence of a deliberate strategy - and which are just another thing going wrong with a party straining to stay afloat. This plot does not have rigid KPIs. There is no timeframe attached to its efforts. The goal is only to undermine her rather than oust her immediately. But the Tory wars have not gone away. We may have seen Labour tensions on display at their conference in Liverpool last week, but nobody does internecine party-on-party hostility quite like the oldest political party in the world. Like Britain, are the Tories becoming ungovernable? Take the defection of a one-time donor to Kemi Badenoch's leadership campaign a year ago, which I revealed this lunchtime. Is that part of the plot or not? CCHQ will never know. Either way, it's serious because of the lessons it teaches us. The background - which can be heard on the Politics At Sam And Anne's podcast which has just been released - is that veteran public affairs professional Mark Gallagher has abandoned Kemi Badenoch in favour of Nigel Farage's Reform UK. \n                  Israeli minister Sharren Haskel attacks Labour's 'grotesque betrayal' of Jewish community\n                 \n                  Kemi praises Thatcher but faces fight with grandees\n                 \n                  A subdued Tory conference could be a chance for Badenoch to turn her fortunes around - but will she?\n                 While he still is understood to like Badenoch personally, he thinks the Tories are not a strong enough medicine for the country. Gallagher is a long-term supporter of several political parties including the Brexit party and, having given Â£2,000 only, he is not Badenoch's largest donor by a long way. There is a suggestion that Badenoch did not respond quickly enough to his messages and attempts to help her. Look at - and internalise - the response from the Tories. An aide to Badenoch said: \"She gets 20 texts every minute from MPs, friends, ex-MPs, supporters, peers, people offering advice and so on. She endeavours to go back to everyone, but realistically she's running the world's oldest political party, doing media interviews, having meetings, doing visits, and being a wife and mother of three young children. So it would be churlish to get quite so upset about timely responses.\" You can sense the intensity of the frustration - the anger at criticism. The willingness to thrash back. Are these wise feelings to succumb to at this point? The Tories claim this does not amount to a \"defection\" because Gallagher hadn't been a member of the Conservative Party since 2020. However, they do not contest that he gave to Badenoch's leadership and now Gallagher is helping her rival. Top Tories talk of three key moments in the coming months. Post May elections, which could be perilous without signs of electoral improvement. Then the November 26 budget if she doesn't perform well - another danger point. Finally the first anniversary of her becoming leader, on November 2 this year. That's the first moment that MPs can submit letters to the newish 1922 chairman Bob Blackman. It takes more than it used to - they changed the rules last year so you now need a third rather than 15% - that's now a third of 119, so 40. So another moment of peril. This week will determine what matters. There is a plot. It's not going away. We just don't know when it will materialise."

        "Content": "\n          Political correspondent\n              @amandaakass\n  The Home Office isn't always known for its fleet-footed response to events. But the new home secretary is clearly determined to show she is listening - and isn't afraid to get tough. Politics live: Opening day of Tory conference Shabana Mahmood has been under massive pressure to take action in response to pro-Palestine protests continuing on the streets of Manchester and London in the aftermath of Thursday's attack, inflaming the raw pain of the Jewish community. On Friday, alongside the prime minister and the chief constables of the Metropolitan and Greater Manchester police forces, she appealed directly to the protest organisers to show some \"humanity\" and pause the protests as a mark of respect for the community's initial shock and grief. Her criticisms were punchy, straight-talking and designed to cut through: pushing ahead with the demonstrations was \"un-British\" and \"dishonourable\". But words alone were clearly not enough - a message plain to see from the boos which greeted David Lammy's arrival at the synagogue vigil and public calls from Israel's foreign affairs minister Gideon Sa'ar for the UK government to \"fight the pro-Palestinian marches and protests which bear antisemitic traits\".  The home secretary has always been careful to defend the right of citizens to carry out lawful protests, and to make it clear that she understands demonstrators' concerns about the situation in Gaza. But her warnings ignored, she has now announced plans to change the law to give the police additional powers to restrict repeated protests which cause communities to feel \"unsafe, intimidated and scared to leave their homes\". Officers will not have the power to cancel protests but to move their location or change the timing - with organisers facing fines of Â£2,500 for ignoring these prescriptions, or potential prison sentences. She told Sunday Morning with Trevor Phillips events of the past few days have highlighted a \"gap\" in the law which she is determined to address, with a further review of all the legislation in this area to be carried out to see if further additional powers are needed. The Tories were this morning forced to accept such plans are \"quite a good idea\" - arguing only that such action should have been taken sooner. But others fear the creeping impact of continuing to tighten the laws around protest - particularly following the public order legislation passed by the last Conservative government. Read more from Sky News:Tory conference may be smaller, leaked data suggestsGreen Party membership overtakes Liberal DemocratsCan Green Party make a dent in Reform UK's rise?  The Liberal Democrats argue that this approach will \"do nothing\" to tackle those spreading antisemitic hate, while \"undermining the fundamental right to protest\". It's a difficult balance to strike in a climate of anger, fear and rising community tensions - and there's an open question about how much impact these rather nuanced additional powers would really have had on the weekend's protests. But Ms Mahmood has clearly decided an urgent response is needed - while leaving the door open to the possibility of tougher, and therefore even more controversial measures in future."
