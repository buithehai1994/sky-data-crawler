        "Content": "The number of people killed in anti-government protests across Iran has risen dramatically to more than 500, according to the US-based Human Rights Activists News Agency, as Donald ​Trump says he ​is ​weighing ‍a range of responses ‌to ‌the escalating unrest. Details on the protests are scarce as a communications blackout is still in effect across Iran's 31 provinces, with demonstrations, which began at the end of December over a sharp decline in the value of the rial currency, continuing into their third week. They have since transformed into the most significant challenge to the regime for several years.

It added that it has also received 579 other reports of deaths that remain under investigation, which would bring the total to 1,123. More than 10,681 individuals have also been transferred to prisons following arrest, the non-government organisation said. \n                  Woman shot dead in head as body bags show emerging picture of Iranian crackdown\n                 \n                  Transport secretary ducks questions over whether UK would support US action in Iran\n                 \n                  Iran's regime is more vulnerable than it has ever been, but Khamenei shows no sign of relenting\n                 It added in an update earlier on Sunday that most of the victims were killed by live ammunition or pellet gunfire, predominantly from close range. State TV showed dozens of body bags on the ground at the coroner's office in Tehran, saying the dead were victims of events caused by \"armed terrorists\", as well as footage of people gathered outside ‌the Kahrizak Forensic Medical Centre in the capital waiting to identify bodies. It comes as Mr Trump and his national security team have been weighing a range of potential responses against Iran. \"The military is looking at it, and we're looking at some very strong options,\" the US president told reporters on Sunday night. Asked about Iran's threats of retaliation, he replied: \"If they do that, we will hit them at levels that they've never been hit before.\" It followed Mr Trump's similar remarks on Friday that the US would hit Tehran \"very hard\" if the government \"start[s] killing people\". Read more:Regime is more vulnerable than ever, but shows no sign of relentingEverything you need to know about the Iran protests Earlier on Sunday, US foreign secretary Marco Rubio discussed the situation in Iran with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Citing an Israeli source, Reuters news agency reported that Mr Rubio and Mr Netanyahu did discuss the possibility of ‍a US intervention in Iran in a phone call on Saturday. Israel is now on high alert ‌for a possible US intervention in Iran amid ongoing anti-government protests, three Israeli sources also told the news agency. A US official confirmed only that the conversation took place, not its content. Separately, the Israeli prime minister praised the \"demonstrations for freedom,\" adding: \"The people of Israel, and ​indeed the entire world, marvel at ‍the immense bravery of the citizens of Iran. \"We all ‍hope that the Persian nation will soon be freed from ​the yoke of tyranny.\" Speaker: US strikes would make bases 'legitimate targets' Meanwhile, Tehran has warned that the US military and Israel would be \"legitimate targets\" if America uses force to protect demonstrators. Mohammad Baagher Qalibaf, the speaker of the Iranian parliament, said: \"In the event of an attack on Iran, both the occupied territory and all American military centres, bases and ships in the region will be our legitimate targets. \"We do not consider ourselves limited to reacting after the action and will act based on any objective signs of a threat.\" While Mr Qalibaf was speaking, MPs in parliament shouted \"Death to America!\" Iranian president ready to listen to people On Sunday, Iran's president, Masoud Pezeshkian, addressed the protests for the first time in an interview with regime-linked national media. During the interview, he said \"terrorists\" linked to foreign powers were killing people, burning mosques and attacking public property, and that Iran's enemies were looking to \"sow chaos and disorder\" by \"ordering riots\". However, Mr Pezeshkian said the Iranian establishment was ready to listen to its people, and that the government was determined to resolve people's economic problems. He then urged citizens to distance themselves from \"rioters and terrorists,\" who he said were trying to \"destroy the entire society\"."

        "Content": "\n          International correspondent\n              @DiMagnaySky\n The extent of the state's crackdown on Iranian protesters is beginning to emerge, despite the internet shutdown. Several videos centre around a forensics institute in the neighbourhood of Kahrizak, south of the capital, Tehran. Some have been filtered out via Starlink, but Iranian state TV has footage from the same location. Latest updates on Iran protests All show a multitude of body bags, some lined up on the floor or on mortuary trolleys, others in long rows outside as relatives search for loved ones. One video contains telling information. It films a screen inside the forensics centre which identifies the dead through a long list of photos, as a loudspeaker calls out their names and asks relatives to collect the body. \n                  More than 500 killed in Iran, rights group says, as Trump and US military weighing 'strong options'\n                 \n                  Transport secretary ducks questions over whether UK would support US action in Iran\n                 \n                  Iran's regime is more vulnerable than it has ever been, but Khamenei shows no sign of relenting\n                 On the left of the screen is a long list of jpeg numbers, correlating with the photos of the deceased. There are 250 of them. The date on the screen is 9 January, Friday. This suggests that in this morgue alone there are the bodies of 250 people, killed during Thursday night's protests. Secret burial Twenty-three-year-old Robina Aminian was shot in the head that night. She was studying fashion at university in Tehran and had gone to join the protests after class. Two family members told Sky News how authorities tried to prevent them from retrieving her body. They finally managed to take her to Kermanshah in western Iran, where they gave her a secret burial. From their reports, it would appear the regime wants to avoid the spectacle and momentum which large-scale mourning might give to the protests, as it did during the revolution which brought the ayatollahs to power in Iran in 1979. \"The Iranian tradition of funeral is that when somebody dies, on the 40th day of the passing of the deceased, people gather to commemorate the death,\" says Sina Azodi of the Atlantic Council. \"In 1978, the revolution and the 40-day ceremony mobilised people to chant against the shah's regime, and then there were more people killed during those demonstrations so there was a cycle, creating martyrs for the revolution. \"The Islamic Republic has learned that lesson.\" Read more:Analysis - Regime more vulnerable than it has ever beenEverything you need to know about the protests The scant information filtering out of Iran makes an already murky situation even more difficult to understand. The US president promised retaliation if the Iranians started firing on protestors, and now he will be weighing his options. One further point of comparison with these protests and the revolution which unseated the shah is that then, as the system started to crumble, the security forces knew the West would welcome them with open arms. That is very far from being the case now. Which means the probability the Revolutionary Guard hunkers down, staying loyal to the hand which feeds them, that bit more likely - a dangerous proposition for the protesters on Iran's streets."

Over 20 flights bound for the airport were cancelled, diverted or delayed overnight - with several flights suffering delays of over four hours. The radar which serves Birmingham Airport was restored shortly before 1.30am on Monday. NATS apologised for the disruption and said they were working closely with the airport as they resume their air traffic service . Engineers from NATS worked with National Grid to resolve the issue, with National Grid saying it responded \"to a power cut in Shropshire\".

Last March, a power outage shut Heathrow Airport, causing travel chaos for more than 270,000 passengers. A report found that the incident, which led to the cancellation of around 1,300 flights, was caused by a \"catastrophic failure\" of equipment in a nearby substation. NATS also came under fire last year, particularly from airlines, when air traffic problems resulted in more than 1,000 flights departing UK airports being cancelled. Martin Rolfe, the chief executive of NATS, told Sky News an initial investigation found the air traffic control failure was caused by flight data which its system \"didn't understand\" and \"couldn't interpret\"."

        "Content": "By Holly Beaumont, news reporter  \"I remember when I was in school I would tell people I believed in God and they would be like 'you're a loser'. Now I couldn't be prouder, it's becoming more normal.\" Love Island and TOWIE star Matilda Draper isn't your average Christian evangelist - but the 25-year-old is one of a growing number of young influencers spreading the word of God online. \"There's so much bad in the world, there's so much negativity that you see online,\" she says. \"The stuff we fill our brain with - it doesn't have any substance and I do think that people are yearning for purpose and fulfilment\". A recent YouGov study found that Gen Z believe in a higher power more than any other generation, with data showing there has been a rise in the religiosity and church attendance among young people. Their levels of faith now even surpass the 65+ age group. Dr Edward David, a lecturer at King's College London, researched the religious behaviours of young people and attributes the increase - in part - to social media. \"Priests and clerics are telling researchers that they are seeing an influx of young people knocking on their doors because they have encountered a religious idea on Instagram,\" says Dr David. \"A lot of young people are learning about religion for the very first time via social media. They might see a 30-second video and then they are hungry for more,\" he adds. He also says Generation Z have got the \"short end of the economic and social stick\", citing the pandemic and cost of living crisis as examples. As a result, he says young people are \"looking for answers\". 'I've definitely noticed a change' Draper grew up attending church, though says she thinks it's \"becoming more normal\" to have faith as a young person - as \"more people talk about it online\". \"I've definitely noticed a change in people speaking about God. I see it a lot on TikTok now, young preachers on the street. \"It's so important for anyone with a following - if you can do that [post about faith] that's such an amazing thing to do.\"  A video she posted of herself being baptised received more than 1.3 million views on TikTok. Draper is one of many influencers who use their platform to talk about religion.  There are more than 25 million videos on TikTok posted under the hashtag #ChristianTikTok. Zack Ubi and Chrissy George - both 25 - have amassed millions of views from posting religious content on social media. They both say they have noticed \"such a rise\" in young people coming to church in the last year. \"It's not just the usual demographic you think would come to church,\" Zack says. \"I am seeing people that look like me, dress like and are similar ages to me. \"There's loads of examples of people messaging me and saying my videos are the reason they have turned to faith,\" he adds, illustrating the influence social media can have. Chrissy also helps to run a TikTok account for her church, creating content to appeal to younger audiences. \"I get so many DMs [direct messages] from young people asking about our church services and how they can get involved,\" Chrissy says. She says she thinks community is another factor driving young people to religion, arguing that this is lacking in society. YouGov also conducted two studies in 2018 and 2024, tracking how religiosity changed among 18 to 25-year-olds. It identified a stark rise in young people attending church and those who say they believe in a higher power. Over the six-year span, the number of young people who said they attended church monthly increased from 7% to 23%. Similarly, just 28% of young people said they believed in a higher power in 2018, and this increased to 49% six years later. 'I don't see anyone posting about religion' This trend is not representative of all young people, however. Hetty Owen is an atheist and says this is not something she has observed despite being active on social media, adding she is \"surprised\" to hear about the data. \"I don't see anyone really posting about [religion] and if I do, it's more like religious persecution,\" the 23-year-old says. Hetty says she believes the increase in interest about religion could be a result of the COVID pandemic, with fewer young people going to university and being exposed to other perspectives. However, the data shows young people have more of an interest in faith than some of the older generations. Whether this change is just temporary remains to be seen, but Gen Z seems to be reshaping ideas about faith in the modern day."

Over 20 flights bound for the airport were cancelled, diverted or delayed overnight - with several flights suffering delays of over four hours. The radar which serves Birmingham Airport was restored shortly before 1.30am on Monday. NATS apologised for the disruption and said they were working closely with the airport as they resume their air traffic service . Engineers from NATS worked with National Grid to resolve the issue, with National Grid saying it responded \"to a power cut in Shropshire\". The technical issue with the NATS radar that serves Birmingham Airport, had meant that only departing flights were being allowed to operate.

Previous incidents This isn't the first time a power issue has caused problems for a major UK airport. Last March, a power outage shut Heathrow Airport, causing travel chaos for more than 270,000 passengers. A report found that the incident, which led to the cancellation of around 1,300 flights, was caused by a \"catastrophic failure\" of equipment in a nearby substation. NATS also came under fire last year, particularly from airlines, when air traffic problems resulted in more than 1,000 flights departing UK airports being cancelled. Martin Rolfe, the chief executive of NATS, told Sky News an initial investigation found the air traffic control failure was caused by flight data which its system \"didn't understand\" and \"couldn't interpret\"."

        "Content": "By Holly Beaumont, news reporter  \"I remember when I was in school I would tell people I believed in God and they would be like 'you're a loser'. Now I couldn't be prouder, it's becoming more normal.\" Love Island and TOWIE star Matilda Draper isn't your average Christian evangelist - but the 25-year-old is one of a growing number of young influencers spreading the word of God online. \"There's so much bad in the world, there's so much negativity that you see online,\" she says. \"The stuff we fill our brain with - it doesn't have any substance and I do think that people are yearning for purpose and fulfilment\". A recent YouGov study found that Gen Z believe in a higher power more than any other generation, with data showing there has been a rise in the religiosity and church attendance among young people. Their levels of faith now even surpass the 65+ age group. Dr Edward David, a lecturer at King's College London, researched the religious behaviours of young people and attributes the increase - in part - to social media. \"Priests and clerics are telling researchers that they are seeing an influx of young people knocking on their doors because they have encountered a religious idea on Instagram,\" says Dr David. \"A lot of young people are learning about religion for the very first time via social media. They might see a 30-second video and then they are hungry for more,\" he adds. He also says Generation Z have got the \"short end of the economic and social stick\", citing the pandemic and cost of living crisis as examples. As a result, he says young people are \"looking for answers\". 'I've definitely noticed a change' Draper grew up attending church, though says she thinks it's \"becoming more normal\" to have faith as a young person - as \"more people talk about it online\". \"I've definitely noticed a change in people speaking about God. I see it a lot on TikTok now, young preachers on the street. \"It's so important for anyone with a following - if you can do that [post about faith] that's such an amazing thing to do.\"  A video she posted of herself being baptised received more than 1.3 million views on TikTok. Draper is one of many influencers who use their platform to talk about religion.  There are more than 25 million videos on TikTok posted under the hashtag #ChristianTikTok. Zack Ubi and Chrissy George - both 25 - have amassed millions of views from posting religious content on social media. They both say they have noticed \"such a rise\" in young people coming to church in the last year. \"It's not just the usual demographic you think would come to church,\" Zack says. \"I am seeing people that look like me, dress like and are similar ages to me. \"There's loads of examples of people messaging me and saying my videos are the reason they have turned to faith,\" he adds, illustrating the influence social media can have. Chrissy also helps to run a TikTok account for her church, creating content to appeal to younger audiences. \"I get so many DMs [direct messages] from young people asking about our church services and how they can get involved,\" Chrissy says. She says she thinks community is another factor driving young people to religion, arguing that this is lacking in society. YouGov also conducted two studies in 2018 and 2024, tracking how religiosity changed among 18 to 25-year-olds. It identified a stark rise in young people attending church and those who say they believe in a higher power. Over the six-year span, the number of young people who said they attended church monthly increased from 7% to 23%. Similarly, just 28% of young people said they believed in a higher power in 2018, and this increased to 49% six years later. 'I don't see anyone posting about religion' This trend is not representative of all young people, however. Hetty Owen is an atheist and says this is not something she has observed despite being active on social media, adding she is \"surprised\" to hear about the data. \"I don't see anyone really posting about [religion] and if I do, it's more like religious persecution,\" the 23-year-old says. Hetty says she believes the increase in interest about religion could be a result of the COVID pandemic, with fewer young people going to university and being exposed to other perspectives. However, the data shows young people have more of an interest in faith than some of the older generations. Whether this change is just temporary remains to be seen, but Gen Z seems to be reshaping ideas about faith in the modern day."

        "Content": "Drivers in England can find out how their local councils are tackling potholes following the introduction of a new traffic rating system from the Department for Transport (DfT). The system shows 154 local highway authorities rated as red, amber or green based on road conditions and how effectively they are spending the government's road maintenance funding. It has bad news for drivers in Cumberland in Cumbria, Bolton in Greater Manchester, Leicestershire, Suffolk, and Kensington and Chelsea in west London - with all areas classed as red under the system. In a statement, the DfT said authorities listed in red will receive \"dedicated support to bring them into line with best practices\" through a £300,000 programme. A majority of local highway authorities are also listed as amber, while green-classified areas include Essex, Wiltshire, Coventry, Leeds, and Darlington in County Durham. The DfT added that the green areas show they are following \"best practice\" such as investing in long-term preventative measures rather than just patching up potholes, while also maintaining good road conditions. The map comes after the government's commitment to provide a total of £7.3bn for local road maintenance funding for the four years up to and including 2029/30 - as part of last year's budget. \n                  Parents of teenager killed in car crash say new road safety measures 'not enough'\n                 \n                  Drivers fined after speed camera issue across major A-roads and motorways\n                 \n                  Driving test changes announced - with more focus on faster and rural roads to cut deaths\n                 Total local road maintenance funding for England provided by the government in the current financial year was also nearly £1.6bn, representing a £500m rise compared with the previous year period. However, a quarter of the extra money was withheld until the end of last year, after authorities had outlined their plans to spend it. Transport Secretary Heidi Alexander told Sunday Morning with Trevor Phillips that she had inherited a \"pretty ridiculous situation\" when Labour came into office. She said there \"isn't data that has been collected on potholes and there isn't actually even a definition of a pothole\". However, asked why the government had not simply published a map telling drivers where to avoid, Ms Alexander said: \"The way in which we worked out how to categorise different local authority areas was based upon a number of factors: the condition of the road, the amount of investment that is being put in, and the extent to which the local authority in question is using best practice, providing good value for money, for the taxpayer.\" Read more from Sky News:Non-league side knock out FA Cup holdersIs it time to give up the green belt?Wildfires sweep across parts of Patagonia Common problems caused by potholes include damaged shock absorbers, broken suspension springs and distorted wheels, according to the RAC. The motoring group also estimates that a typical repair bill for a family car suffering pothole damage beyond a puncture is £590. RAC head of policy Simon Williams said: \"While there are examples of good road maintenance practice taking place, this isn't consistent across the country and means drivers have for too long been left with substandard roads. \"We hope this initiative, plus the promise of longer-term funding for councils to allow them to plan and carry out much-needed preventative maintenance, means we're finally on the way to having smoother, better roads.\" But shadow transport secretary Richard Holden said \"a map won't stop tyres blowing or suspensions snapping\". \"Motorists, already being squeezed tight by Labour, deserve real action to back them,\" he added. \"Only the Conservatives will deliver that.\""

        "Content": "\n          News correspondent\n              @SkyNewsAdele\n Eighteen‑year‑old Frazer McKenna has spent most of his adolescence living with the consequences of something he never chose to see. Warning: This story contains descriptions some readers may find distressing, including references to self-harm and suicide. He was just 12, going on 13 and in Year 8, when a classmate pushed a phone into his face during breaktime. On the screen was a recording of a live video of a man taking his own life with a gun. It happened in seconds, but the effects have lasted years. \"There are no words to express how much of an impact that video truly had on me,\" Frazer said, \"my life would have been completely different if I hadn't seen it.\" Frazer had already been struggling in the aftermath of the COVID pandemic. But the shock of that moment, and the isolation he felt afterwards, sent him into a spiral. \"I felt lost, hopeless,\" he said. \"I didn't want to speak up because my friends would have just been... 'man up'.\" Over the last few years, his mental health deteriorated. He experienced severe depression and moments of crisis. He even tried to take his own life. His father, Damian, recalls one night when he had to physically intervene to stop his son harming himself. 'He wanted to hurt himself' \"He wanted to hurt himself with a knife, a big knife,\" he said, \"I wasn't going to see my son hurt himself or worse.\" He said he will be \"haunted\" for the rest of his life by seeing his son \"break down in tears\". \"He hadn't done it in a malicious, nasty way. This was pure desperation.\" Frazer: 'I'd lash out' It wasn't until last year, four years after he unwillingly saw the disturbing video, that Frazer was diagnosed with complex Post‑Traumatic Stress Disorder, directly linked to what he saw at school. He describes \"triggers\" he still experiences, including the sound of a Nokia mobile phone ringtone from the video. \"It would set me off,\" he said. \"It would make me anxious, melt down, I went into a state of uncontrollably not being able to maintain normal behaviour and I'd lash out on people because of it.\" He also described being affected by \"the sounds from the video of the blood running. It resonates with me a lot whenever I hear fountains, water… and those have been key points to show that this video is a big, big, big part of why I was suffering so much.\" Not an isolated case Frazer's experience is not an isolated case, according to clinicians. Dr Emily Sehmer, a consultant child psychiatrist, said she sees similar stories far too often. \"It's very, very common, unfortunately,\" she said. \"Frazer's case did not surprise me… there are a lot of children who have struggled in similar ways and have not come forward. \"Our services are not equipped to manage this level of mental health problems, and I don't see that number will reduce if children continue to be exposed to this kind of online content.\" Last year, she notes, around 500 children a day in England were referred to mental health services for anxiety alone. Frazer and his family are now supporting a campaign to ban smartphones in all schools - not just in classrooms, but on the journey to and from school as well. \"There's so much technology in schools today, you don't need phones in school,\" Frazer said. \"It's unnecessary. …in the hands of people who can be naive and irresponsible.\" \"...a few seconds that could completely change someone's life.\" Read more from Sky News:Legal change to cyber flashing offenceHalf of porn users escaping age checks The current guidance allows headteachers to decide how smartphones are used, but campaigners argue the safest approach would be a complete ban on them in all schools. The Department for Education said that 99.8% of primary schools and 90% of secondary schools already have mobile phone restrictions in place and said they \"support headteachers to take the necessary steps to prevent disruption backed by our clear guidance\". It added: \"Through the Online Safety Act, we have taken some of the boldest steps anywhere in the world to ensure children have age-appropriate experiences online, protecting them from harmful content. \"We are striking the right balance: protecting children while ensuring they can safely benefit from the digital world, without risking isolation or cutting off access to vital services, especially to the most vulnerable.\" Officials point to new legal duties requiring social media companies to protect under‑18s from harmful material, including content linked to self‑harm and suicide, with Ofcom able to issue significant penalties for breaches. :: Anyone feeling emotionally distressed or suicidal can call Samaritans for help on 116 123 or email jo@samaritans.org in the UK.

Details on the protests are scarce as a communications blackout is still in effect across Iran's 31 provinces, with demonstrations, which began at the end of December over a sharp decline in the value of the rial currency, continuing into their third week.

State TV showed dozens of body bags on the ground at the coroner's office in Tehran, saying the dead were victims of events caused by \"armed terrorists\", as well as footage of people gathered outside ‌the Kahrizak Forensic Medical Centre in the capital waiting to identify bodies. It comes as Mr Trump and his national security team have been weighing a range of potential responses against Iran. \"The military is looking at it, and we're looking at some very strong options,\" the US president told reporters on Sunday night. Asked about Iran's threats of retaliation, he replied: \"If they do that, we will hit them at levels that they've never been hit before.\" It followed Mr Trump's similar remarks on Friday that the US would hit Tehran \"very hard\" if the government \"start[s] killing people\". Read more:Regime is more vulnerable than ever, but shows no sign of relentingEverything you need to know about the Iran protests Earlier on Sunday, US foreign secretary Marco Rubio discussed the situation in Iran with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.

Israel is now on high alert ‌for a possible US intervention in Iran amid ongoing anti-government protests, three Israeli sources also told the news agency. A US official confirmed only that the conversation took place, not its content.

Mohammad Baagher Qalibaf, the speaker of the Iranian parliament, said: \"In the event of an attack on Iran, both the occupied territory and all American military centres, bases and ships in the region will be our legitimate targets. \"We do not consider ourselves limited to reacting after the action and will act based on any objective signs of a threat.\" While Mr Qalibaf was speaking, MPs in parliament shouted \"Death to America!\" Iranian president ready to listen to people On Sunday, Iran's president, Masoud Pezeshkian, addressed the protests for the first time in an interview with regime-linked national media. During the interview, he said \"terrorists\" linked to foreign powers were killing people, burning mosques and attacking public property, and that Iran's enemies were looking to \"sow chaos and disorder\" by \"ordering riots\". However, Mr Pezeshkian said the Iranian establishment was ready to listen to its people, and that the government was determined to resolve people's economic problems. He then urged citizens to distance themselves from \"rioters and terrorists,\" who he said were trying to \"destroy the entire society\"."

It said in a statement that at 1.57pm on Sunday, rescue teams got an avalanche alert and went to the site in southeastern France. A team of around 52 people, including medics and ski school instructors, as well as a helicopter-deployed piste dog, were called in. The Englishman was discovered after 50 minutes of searching under 2.5m of snow, the resort said. He was with a group when the avalanche struck, but was not equipped with an avalanche transceiver and was not with a professional instructor, it added. La Plagne said its thoughts were with the man's family."

        "Content": "\n          International correspondent\n              @DiMagnaySky\n The extent of the state's crackdown on Iranian protesters is beginning to emerge, despite the internet shutdown. Several videos centre around a forensics institute in the neighbourhood of Kahrizak, south of the capital, Tehran. Some have been filtered out via Starlink, but Iranian state TV has footage from the same location. Latest updates on Iran protests All show a multitude of body bags, some lined up on the floor or on mortuary trolleys, others in long rows outside as relatives search for loved ones. One video contains telling information. It films a screen inside the forensics centre which identifies the dead through a long list of photos, as a loudspeaker calls out their names and asks relatives to collect the body. \n                  More than 500 killed in Iran, rights group says, as Trump and US military weighing 'strong options'\n                 \n                  Transport secretary ducks questions over whether UK would support US action in Iran\n                 \n                  Iran's regime is more vulnerable than it has ever been, but Khamenei shows no sign of relenting\n                 On the left of the screen is a long list of jpeg numbers, correlating with the photos of the deceased. There are 250 of them. The date on the screen is 9 January, Friday. This suggests that in this morgue alone there are the bodies of 250 people, killed during Thursday night's protests. Secret burial Twenty-three-year-old Robina Aminian was shot in the head that night. She was studying fashion at university in Tehran and had gone to join the protests after class. Two family members told Sky News how authorities tried to prevent them from retrieving her body. They finally managed to take her to Kermanshah in western Iran, where they gave her a secret burial. From their reports, it would appear the regime wants to avoid the spectacle and momentum which large-scale mourning might give to the protests, as it did during the revolution which brought the ayatollahs to power in Iran in 1979. \"The Iranian tradition of funeral is that when somebody dies, on the 40th day of the passing of the deceased, people gather to commemorate the death,\" says Sina Azodi of the Atlantic Council. \"In 1978, the revolution and the 40-day ceremony mobilised people to chant against the shah's regime, and then there were more people killed during those demonstrations so there was a cycle, creating martyrs for the revolution. \"The Islamic Republic has learned that lesson.\" Read more:Analysis - Regime more vulnerable than it has ever beenEverything you need to know about the protests The scant information filtering out of Iran makes an already murky situation even more difficult to understand. The US president promised retaliation if the Iranians started firing on protestors, and now he will be weighing his options. One further point of comparison with these protests and the revolution which unseated the shah is that then, as the system started to crumble, the security forces knew the West would welcome them with open arms. That is very far from being the case now. Which means the probability the Revolutionary Guard hunkers down, staying loyal to the hand which feeds them, that bit more likely - a dangerous proposition for the protesters on Iran's streets."

        "Content": "\n          Europe correspondent\n              @SiobhanRobbins\n In Germany's fight against people smugglers, Chief Inspector Igor Weber's Pasewalk force is on the frontline. Their patch includes part of the border area with Poland, a popular spot for people trying to cross illegally into Germany. At the police headquarters, the chief inspector shows us a line of smugglers' vehicles, which were seized while trafficking illegal migrants. One of them is a refrigerated van which has been stripped back to carry human cargo. Inside, sodden sleeping bags and a few abandoned clothes are the only traces of the migrants who were moved like cattle for hundreds of miles. Chief Inspector Weber says there were 18 people inside when they found the van. There are no seats or seatbelts, just the hard, cold floor to sit on during the long journey. A hole in the roof left them exposed to the elements, so the rain could pour in, making conditions even more grim. This isn't a one-off. Officers show us pictures of other illegal migrants they have stopped. One shows nine East Africans found crammed in a car, again without seats or seatbelts. In another, 16 exhausted Somalis rest on the grass. Many of the migrants have been travelling for months. Route to Germany After leaving Africa, the Middle East or Asia, Chief Inspector Weber says lots of people now come via Russia, travelling through Belarus, into Latvia, Lithuania and on to Poland. They keep driving until they cross into northeastern Germany and straight into the patch patrolled by the Pasewalk force. As a result, the fight against illegal migration has become a daily game of cat and mouse. Germany's border with Poland is more than 400km (249 miles) long, surrounded by huge stretches of isolated farmland, dense forest and small villages. The perfect place to hide. Throughout the day, the chief inspector takes us to different areas which have become crossing hotspots. We drive to a quiet checkpoint surrounded by fields, which we are told is one of the places people traffickers try their luck. It's manned by two Polish guards when we arrive. The chief inspector explains the smugglers send a spotter car out to the top of a small hill above the checkpoint. From there, the countryside opens up, allowing them to see if there are any controls in place. If there aren't, the smugglers then drive in with the illegal migrants. The smugglers take a photo of them in front of a sign proving they have brought them to Germany and then leave the migrants to walk the rest of their journey alone. It's a complex and well-funded criminal racket. 'Insidious' smuggling business But the German government has had enough. Border checks have been tightened up and asylum rules made stricter. We watch as police search the cross-border train, looking for anyone trying to sneak in that way. But as we drive around rural routes filled with hiding places, the challenge facing authorities is clear. \"Is it possible for you to stop all illegal migrants?\" I ask the chief inspector. \"No,\" he replies. \"No border is 100% closed - that doesn't exist. In my professional experience, people always manage to overcome even the biggest walls or fences, but you can make that more difficult.\" It seems Germany has done just that: in 2025, illegal entries were down 25% compared with the year before, according to figures from the interior ministry. \"Who do you think's winning? The police and border control, or the smugglers?\" I ask. \"There are no winners in this business. The biggest losers are the migrants. That's just the way it is. Smuggling is a very insidious business - it's all about money,\" Chief Inspector Weber replies. Hardening views Germany's attitude to asylum seekers has radically changed. In 2015, people cheered as refugees arrived at German train stations under Chancellor Angela Merkel's open-door policy. The move saw more than a million, mainly Afghan and Syrian asylum seekers, enter in a year. In the past decade, views have hardened. The far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party has soared in the polls, fuelled by its anti-immigration policy. In response, the ruling coalition has also got tough; by November 2025, deportations were already up 15% on 2024. But some recent deportation flights have been controversial. In the summer, a plane carried 81 criminals back to Afghanistan, while in December, Germany deported a convicted criminal to Syria for the first time since the start of a 14-year-long civil war. Now the government is hoping to strike a deal to deport more Afghans as well as return Syrians. Read more:Inside smuggling trade bringing migrants from AfricaMan who supplied boats to people smugglers jailed Despite criticism from human rights groups, it is standing by its policy. \"It is necessary we show the people that we are able to control who is coming to Germany and who [is] not,\" Germany's foreign minister Johann Wadephul told me at a recent news conference. \"So that is the deeper reason why we are controlling the borders now, and we are doing this in accordance with international law.\" Traditionally the EU country which took the most asylum seekers, Germany has slashed first-time applications by more than half so far this year. The government says it's proof its stricter policies are working. But as Germany toughens up its asylum system, nearly a million people are living with rejections, and the largest number are from Afghanistan. They say they're living in limbo. 'I'm not a criminal' At a church in Berlin, I meet Sayed who has just found out his application has been rejected. He says returning to Afghanistan is a death sentence. Terrified, he asks us not to show his face as he tells me his story. \"They [the German authorities] rejected me and said it's safe to go back to Afghanistan,\" he explains. \"Everyone knows the consequences if a believer goes to Afghanistan. They won't survive there.\" I ask him if there's any reason he can think of for the rejection? \"I have never done anything wrong in my whole life and I'm not a criminal,\" he replies. For his pastor, Dr Gottfried Martens, it's a sadly familiar story. His congregation includes 1,400 asylum seekers from Afghanistan and Iran. He believes asylum applications have fallen not because of the government crackdown, but because of changes inside countries like Syria, where many refugees come from. He says the tough new rules mean some of his congregation have already fled rather than risk being deported to Afghanistan. \"There has been a framing in the speeches of German politicians and for them, all Afghans are criminals,\" he says. It's a claim ministers would refute. Germany's problem may soon become UK's I ask what those who have had their applications rejected will do now? \"Our people see no other way than to look for a country outside of the European Union, which is in fact the UK, because they know when they stay here then they will be dead pretty soon,\" he replies. If the pastor is right, Germany's problem may soon become Britain's. Those fleeing know since Brexit it's much harder for the UK to return people to Germany. Whether Sayed joins a small boat crossing is undecided. I ask if he understands the view of many Germans that they've taken some of the highest levels of asylum seekers in the world and enough is enough? \"Enough is enough? They are talking about human rights,\" he says. \"As a human, it's my right to be free to live.\" Looking at the statistics available for 2025, on paper Germany's crackdown seems to be working. Initial figures show illegal migration is down, deportations are up and asylum applications have more than halved. A new government in Syria and EU deals with other countries to curb the flow of migrants have undoubtedly also played a role. But the question is, has Germany solved its migration problem or simply moved it on? Are those fleeing war and persecution now just paying smugglers to take them to other countries they hope are safe havens?"

The human remains were found next to a vehicle in Longwood, around 70miles north of Melbourne. Police said the victim has not yet been identified. The fires come during a summer heatwave, which has torn through more than 860,000 acres of bushland in Victoria state since the middle of the week. The blazes have destroyed more than 300 structures, including homes, leaving thousands without power. Authorities have described the fires as the worst to hit the southeast since the Black Summer blazes in 2019 and 2020, which destroyed an area the size of Turkey and killed 33 people. Victoria's premier, Jacinta Allan, said more than 30 fires were burning across the state. In the neighbouring New South Wales, which includes Sydney, several fires close to the Victorian border were burning at the highest danger rating, according to the Rural Fire Service.

        "Content": "A cabinet minister has said anyone associated with Jeffrey Epstein should \"apologise\" to his victims after Lord Mandelson declined to do so. The former US ambassador refused to apologise for his personal relationship with Jeffrey Epstein when interviewed by the BBC this morning. Politics latest: Minister 'very concerned' by violence in Iran amid 'repressive regime' Asked by Sky News' political reporter Ben Bloch whether Lord Mandelson should have apologised, Business Secretary Peter Kyle said: \"I saw some of the interview this morning. \"I think everyone associated with Epstein should be apologising for the lapse of judgement that led to any kind of relationship with that man.\" Lord Mandelson, who was sacked last September over emails which showed the extent of his support for the convicted paedophile following his conviction, told BBC One's Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg he had paid a \"calamitous\" price for their association. But he told BBC One's Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg that he \"never saw anything in his life when I was with him, when I was in his homes, that would give me any reason to suspect what this evil monster was doing in preying on these young women. \"I think the issue is that because I was a gay man in his circle, I was kept separate from what he was doing in the sexual side of his life.\" Asked whether he wanted to apologise to Epstein's victims, Lord Mandelson said he wanted to apologise for a \"system that refused to hear their voices and did not give them the protection they were entitled to expect\". But pressed on whether he would apologise for his personal actions, Lord Mandelson said: \"If I had known, if I was in any way complicit or culpable, of course I would apologise… but I was not culpable, I was not knowledgeable for what he was doing, and I regret, and will regret to my dying day, the fact that powerless women were not given the protection they were entitled to expect.\" \"I saw some of the interview this morning. I think everyone associated with Epstein (should be) apologising for the lapse of judgement that led to any kind of relationship with that man.\" In 2008, Epstein pleaded guilty to soliciting prostitution and soliciting a minor but Lord Mandelson said he believed his excuses and continued to support him. Emails showed the former Labour MP told Epstein to \"fight for early release\" shortly before he was sentenced to 18 months in prison. He is also reported to have told Epstein, \"I think the world of you\", the day before the disgraced financier began his jail sentence. Asked if he believed he deserved to be sacked by Sir Keir Starmer, he replied: \"I understand why I was sacked. \"I understand why he took the decision he did. But one thing I'm very clear about is I'm not going to seek to reopen or relitigate this issue. I'm moving on.\" Lord Mandelson also sought to distance himself from Epstein, arguing he was \"at the edge of this man's life\" - despite a handwritten note coming to light from Epstein's 50th birthday in 2003 book where he described him as his \"best pal\". Asked why he had stuck with Epstein, Lord Mandelson said: \"It was a most terrible mistake on my part. I believed the story he told in 2008 in his first indictment in Florida, I accepted his story, and I wish I hadn't. \"I gave my support to somebody because I believed what he was telling me, and it was misplaced loyalty, but I just have to say this to you: while it's had the most calamitous consequences for me, the crux of this is not me. The crux of this is not the friendship I had 25 years ago with Jeffrey Epstein. \"The crux of this is that so many hundreds of young women were completely trapped, powerless in a system that did not listen to what they had to say.\" Read more:What do we know about Mandelson's relationship with Epstein?Asylum hotel migrant evictions set to begin in the spring Transport Secretary Heidi Alexander told the programme: \"I think what we saw there in that interview was, at best, deep naivety from Peter Mandelson. \"And I think it would have gone a long way for the women who were subjected to the most appalling treatment at the hands of Jeffrey Epstein for Peter to have apologised and taken that opportunity.\" Epstein was found dead in his cell at a federal jail in Manhattan, New York, in August 2019 while he awaited trial on sex trafficking charges.

Mr Trump said Thursday that Ms Machado plans to visit next week and described the idea of a Peace Prize offering as a \"great honour\".

        "Content": "\n          City editor\n              @MarkKleinmanSky\n WH Smith, the London-listed travel retail group, is drawing up plans to identify a new chairman amid a battle to restore investors' faith in the company. Sky News has learnt that a search for two new non-executive directors is expected to lead to the recruitment of a candidate capable of replacing Annette Court within about 18 months. WH Smith, which was plunged into crisis by the emergence of accounting errors which sent its shares spiralling in the second half of last year, has said it wants to appoint a new board member with experience of the North American travel retail market - a key region for the company. Ms Court, who has only chaired WH Smith for three years, is also on the board of the accounting software group Sage. Last week, she was appointed senior independent director of Next, the FTSE-100 clothing retailer. One person with knowledge of the WH Smith appointment process said that Russell Reynolds Associates was advising the company. They added that while Ms Court was not expected to step down during this calendar year, she may do so in 2027. \n                  Next puts best foot forward in pursuit of Russell & Bromley \n                 \n                  High street giant Next has bumper Christmas but remains cautious amid worsening UK jobs market\n                 \n                  Facewatch: The controversial tech that retailers have deployed to tackle shoplifting and violence\n                 A source close to the company said that Ms Court had been deeply involved in addressing its troubles in recent months and that its board was focused on effective succession planning rather than an active search for a new chair. WH Smith is expected to face a string of questions from shareholders at its annual meeting early next month about the accounting crisis. The company is already without a permanent chief executive after Carl Cowling stepped down when the scale of the issues became clear. It has appointed Andrew Harrison, who previously ran its UK travel division, as its interim boss. WH Smith is now under investigation by the Financial Conduct Authority over the accounting issues, with former senior executives now expected to have parts of their bonus awards clawed back.

WH Smith has also drawn attention from activist investors including Palliser Capital, which acquired a stake in the business last summer. Shares in the company closed on Friday at 643.5p, giving it a market capitalisation of about £810m. The stock has fallen by about 45% over the last year. A spokesman for WH Smith declined to comment on Sunday."

        "Content": "\n          Business and economics reporter\n              @taaffems\n The company behind London's Pride parade recorded a £120,726 loss in 2024, latest accounts show.  The entity that runs the capital's annual LGBT+ event had made £204,368 in profit the previous year. It comes as Pride organisations have been struggling with running costs. Major cities across the UK had either paused the running of full events or became insolvent in 2025. The organisations behind Liverpool and Plymouth Pride parades did not hold their annual events last year because of financial and organisational challenges, while Manchester Pride was put into voluntary liquidation, leaving artists, suppliers and freelancers unpaid. Pride organisers are facing \"the most serious financial challenge in the movement's history\", Dee Llewellyn, chair of the UK Pride Organisers Network (UKPON), said. \"The cost of delivering safe, inclusive Pride events - including production, staging, security and infrastructure - is increasing by around 15 to 20% year on year. \"At the same time, we are seeing a marked decline in corporate engagement, particularly from companies headquartered in the United States, influenced by the current political climate.\" The UK's biggest LGBT+ charity, Stonewall, reported that corporate donations had halved to £143,149 in the 2025 financial year, down from £348,636 in 2024. What's happening with Pride in London? Pride in London's accounts do not detail 2025 finances, a year in which it obtained a High Court injunction against its chief executive, Christopher Joell-Deshields, to return control of bank accounts to the organisation. The company said Mr Joell-Deshields has been on a leave of absence since 29 August and due to a \"long and protracted exercise\" to regain control of \"key organisational systems\" from him, the company's accounts were filed more than three months late. Mr Joell-Deshields declined to comment. A spokesperson for the company behind Pride in London, London LGBT Community Pride CIC (LLCPC), said a compulsory strike-off action filed by Companies House, which has since been discontinued, was due to \"a number of operational challenges\" which delayed the accounts filing and updated information being processed at Companies House. They said the organisation's finances were \"stable\", and it looks forward to a successful Pride in London 2026, despite it being a challenging time for Pride organisations. In November, a LLCPC spokesperson told Sky News the accounts would be visible on Companies House within 10 working days. The latest accounts for 2024 said the company benefits from a \"secure long-term funding framework, through its significant funding commitment from the Greater London Authority, which extends through 2027\". The organisation attracted 33,000 participants to the London Pride parade and doubled the number of employees from two in 2023 to four in 2024, the accounts read."

        "Content": "A cabinet minister has said anyone associated with Jeffrey Epstein should \"apologise\" to his victims after Lord Mandelson declined to do so. The former US ambassador refused to apologise for his personal relationship with Jeffrey Epstein when interviewed by the BBC this morning. Politics latest: Minister 'very concerned' by violence in Iran amid 'repressive regime' Asked by Sky News' political reporter Ben Bloch whether Lord Mandelson should have apologised, Business Secretary Peter Kyle said: \"I saw some of the interview this morning. \"I think everyone associated with Epstein should be apologising for the lapse of judgement that led to any kind of relationship with that man.\" Lord Mandelson, who was sacked last September over emails which showed the extent of his support for the convicted paedophile following his conviction, told BBC One's Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg he had paid a \"calamitous\" price for their association. But he told BBC One's Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg that he \"never saw anything in his life when I was with him, when I was in his homes, that would give me any reason to suspect what this evil monster was doing in preying on these young women. \"I think the issue is that because I was a gay man in his circle, I was kept separate from what he was doing in the sexual side of his life.\" Asked whether he wanted to apologise to Epstein's victims, Lord Mandelson said he wanted to apologise for a \"system that refused to hear their voices and did not give them the protection they were entitled to expect\". But pressed on whether he would apologise for his personal actions, Lord Mandelson said: \"If I had known, if I was in any way complicit or culpable, of course I would apologise… but I was not culpable, I was not knowledgeable for what he was doing, and I regret, and will regret to my dying day, the fact that powerless women were not given the protection they were entitled to expect.\" \"I saw some of the interview this morning. I think everyone associated with Epstein (should be) apologising for the lapse of judgement that led to any kind of relationship with that man.\" In 2008, Epstein pleaded guilty to soliciting prostitution and soliciting a minor but Lord Mandelson said he believed his excuses and continued to support him. Emails showed the former Labour MP told Epstein to \"fight for early release\" shortly before he was sentenced to 18 months in prison. He is also reported to have told Epstein, \"I think the world of you\", the day before the disgraced financier began his jail sentence. Asked if he believed he deserved to be sacked by Sir Keir Starmer, he replied: \"I understand why I was sacked. \"I understand why he took the decision he did. But one thing I'm very clear about is I'm not going to seek to reopen or relitigate this issue. I'm moving on.\" Lord Mandelson also sought to distance himself from Epstein, arguing he was \"at the edge of this man's life\" - despite a handwritten note coming to light from Epstein's 50th birthday in 2003 book where he described him as his \"best pal\". Asked why he had stuck with Epstein, Lord Mandelson said: \"It was a most terrible mistake on my part. I believed the story he told in 2008 in his first indictment in Florida, I accepted his story, and I wish I hadn't. \"I gave my support to somebody because I believed what he was telling me, and it was misplaced loyalty, but I just have to say this to you: while it's had the most calamitous consequences for me, the crux of this is not me. The crux of this is not the friendship I had 25 years ago with Jeffrey Epstein. \"The crux of this is that so many hundreds of young women were completely trapped, powerless in a system that did not listen to what they had to say.\" Read more:What do we know about Mandelson's relationship with Epstein?Asylum hotel migrant evictions set to begin in the spring Transport Secretary Heidi Alexander told the programme: \"I think what we saw there in that interview was, at best, deep naivety from Peter Mandelson. \"And I think it would have gone a long way for the women who were subjected to the most appalling treatment at the hands of Jeffrey Epstein for Peter to have apologised and taken that opportunity.\" Epstein was found dead in his cell at a federal jail in Manhattan, New York, in August 2019 while he awaited trial on sex trafficking charges. His death was ruled a suicide."

Transport secretary Heidi Alexander said she was \"not going to get into commentary on the comments from another country about their foreign policy or military plans\". Politics latest: Mandelson refuses to apologise to Epstein victims following sacking So far, the UK government has issued statements of support to the protesters in Iran but has steered away from commenting on whether the US should intervene. Speaking to Sunday Morning with Trevor Phillips, Ms Alexander said the UK's priority was to \"stem the violence\". Pressed on whether the UK would support threats of \"aggressive action\" in Iran by the United States, Ms Alexander said: \"I'm not going to get into commentary on the comments from another country about their foreign policy or military plans. I'm simply not going to do it.\" It comes amid ongoing and widespread protests against the Iranian regime that began over the failing economy but grew into opposition with the government itself. US President Donald Trump has fuelled suggestions he could be prepared to take action against Tehran, saying Iran is \"looking for freedom\" and he stands \"ready to help\". His words are being interpreted with added weight after the Trump administration captured Nicolas Maduro from Venezuela. Maduro is facing drug trafficking charges in New York. The US also launched airstrikes against Iran last summer. In contrast to the government's position, Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch has indicated she would back the UK taking military action in Iran if it took place \"with a broad coalition of countries\". In an interview with the BBC's Sunday With Laura Kuenssberg programme, Ms Badenoch said Iran would \"very happily wipe out the UK if it felt it could get away with it\". She added that Iran, which the UK regards as a hostile state, had tried to \"kill people on our soil\" and she did not \"have an issue with removing a regime that is trying to harm us\". Asked if it would be right for the US and its allies to be involved in regime change, Mrs Badenoch added: \"Given the threat that we're seeing to the people, I think that would be right.\" Pressed on what part the UK could play in helping to remove the regime, she suggested airstrikes similar to those carried out by the RAF against ISIS in Syria, with co-operation from France. \"Well, you've seen the recent RAF strikes, for instance in Syria,\" she said. \"We are talking about hypothetical situations. We have worked in alliance with other countries. I think this has to be something that we do with a broad coalition of countries. \"That is the right way to do it, and to make sure that we create a stable Iran.

It's their revolution.\" More than a hundred people have been killed and thousands detained in the uprising against Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei's rule. The protests in Iran began on 28 December and have transformed into the most significant uprising against the regime for several years. The internet and telephone lines have been cut off, but footage of events in Tehran and other cities has made it to social media. The US-based Human Rights Activists News Agency said the number of confirmed fatalities had risen to 116, with 2,638 people detained."

        "Content": "Bob Weir, guitarist, singer and founding member of the Grateful Dead, has died at the age of 78. A family statement, posted on his website, confirmed Weir - who was diagnosed with cancer in July - died \"peacefully, surrounded by loved ones\" after developing \"underlying lung issues\". In a lengthy tribute, the statement added: 'Bobby will forever be a guiding force whose unique artistry reshaped American music.\" Weir was one of the ⁠group's two frontmen and main vocalists for most of the band's history. Born in 1947 in San Francisco, and originally named Robert Hall Parber, Weir struggled at school, partly due to dyslexia. In 1964, he met folk musician Jerry Garcia, with whom he formed the Warlocks, which morphed into the ‍Grateful Dead. Weir was the youngest member of the original band and was sometimes referred to as \"the kid\". \n                  Golden Globes latest: Stars hit the red carpet ahead of tonight's ceremony\n                 \n                  How did Gen Z become the most religious generation alive?\n                 \n                  Most anticipated video games coming out in 2026\n                 It was Weir who sang the verses on the band's trademark boogie anthem Truckin' and who wrote such key songs as Sugar Magnolia, Playing In The Band and Jack Straw. After the death of fellow co-founder and lead guitarist Garcia at the age of 53 in 1995, Weir carved out a solo career - much of it with his band, RatDog. He also participated in reunions of surviving Dead members in different configurations. Weir was linked to numerous other rock bands during his career, including Kingfish, Bobby And The Midnites, Furthur and in 2015 formed Dead & Company with a lineup of former Grateful Dead members.

Weir's own musical tastes ranged from Chuck Berry to cowboy songs to R&B and reggae. As the band's rhythm guitarist, Weir often played little fills, riffs and figures instead of straight chords. \"I derived a lot of what I do on guitar from listening to piano players,\" he told GQ magazine in 2019. Thanks to relentless touring, constant musical evolution and a passionate fan base, the Grateful Dead - who existed from 1965 to 1995 - ‌did not have to rely on producing hit records. Weir's death leaves drummer Bill Kreutzmann as the only surviving original member. Founding bassist Phil Lesh died in 2024. Weir is survived by his wife, Natascha, and two daughters, Chloe and Monet."

        "Content": "By Holly Beaumont, news reporter  \"I remember when I was in school I would tell people I believed in God and they would be like 'you're a loser'. Now I couldn't be prouder, it's becoming more normal.\" Love Island and TOWIE star Matilda Draper isn't your average Christian evangelist - but the 25-year-old is one of a growing number of young influencers spreading the word of God online. \"There's so much bad in the world, there's so much negativity that you see online,\" she says. \"The stuff we fill our brain with - it doesn't have any substance and I do think that people are yearning for purpose and fulfilment\". A recent YouGov study found that Gen Z believe in a higher power more than any other generation, with data showing there has been a rise in the religiosity and church attendance among young people. Their levels of faith now even surpass the 65+ age group. Dr Edward David, a lecturer at King's College London, researched the religious behaviours of young people and attributes the increase - in part - to social media. \"Priests and clerics are telling researchers that they are seeing an influx of young people knocking on their doors because they have encountered a religious idea on Instagram,\" says Dr David. \"A lot of young people are learning about religion for the very first time via social media. They might see a 30-second video and then they are hungry for more,\" he adds. He also says Generation Z have got the \"short end of the economic and social stick\", citing the pandemic and cost of living crisis as examples. As a result, he says young people are \"looking for answers\". 'I've definitely noticed a change' Draper grew up attending church, though says she thinks it's \"becoming more normal\" to have faith as a young person - as \"more people talk about it online\". \"I've definitely noticed a change in people speaking about God. I see it a lot on TikTok now, young preachers on the street. \"It's so important for anyone with a following - if you can do that [post about faith] that's such an amazing thing to do.\"  A video she posted of herself being baptised received more than 1.3 million views on TikTok. Draper is one of many influencers who use their platform to talk about religion.  There are more than 25 million videos on TikTok posted under the hashtag #ChristianTikTok. Zack Ubi and Chrissy George - both 25 - have amassed millions of views from posting religious content on social media. They both say they have noticed \"such a rise\" in young people coming to church in the last year. \"It's not just the usual demographic you think would come to church,\" Zack says. \"I am seeing people that look like me, dress like and are similar ages to me. \"There's loads of examples of people messaging me and saying my videos are the reason they have turned to faith,\" he adds, illustrating the influence social media can have. Chrissy also helps to run a TikTok account for her church, creating content to appeal to younger audiences. \"I get so many DMs [direct messages] from young people asking about our church services and how they can get involved,\" Chrissy says. She says she thinks community is another factor driving young people to religion, arguing that this is lacking in society. YouGov also conducted two studies in 2018 and 2024, tracking how religiosity changed among 18 to 25-year-olds. It identified a stark rise in young people attending church and those who say they believe in a higher power. Over the six-year span, the number of young people who said they attended church monthly increased from 7% to 23%. Similarly, just 28% of young people said they believed in a higher power in 2018, and this increased to 49% six years later. 'I don't see anyone posting about religion' This trend is not representative of all young people, however. Hetty Owen is an atheist and says this is not something she has observed despite being active on social media, adding she is \"surprised\" to hear about the data. \"I don't see anyone really posting about [religion] and if I do, it's more like religious persecution,\" the 23-year-old says. Hetty says she believes the increase in interest about religion could be a result of the COVID pandemic, with fewer young people going to university and being exposed to other perspectives. However, the data shows young people have more of an interest in faith than some of the older generations. Whether this change is just temporary remains to be seen, but Gen Z seems to be reshaping ideas about faith in the modern day."
