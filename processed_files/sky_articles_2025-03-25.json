        "Content": "\n          Political reporter\n              @fayebrownSky\n  Rachel Reeves will unveil further welfare cuts in her spring statement after being told the reforms announced last week will save less than planned, Sky News understands. The Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) has rejected the government's assessment that the package of measures, including narrowing the eligibility criteria for personal independence payments (PIP), will save £5bn. Politics latest: Ex-Labour leader says Starmer 'an enormous disappointment' The fiscal watchdog put the value of the cuts at £3.4bn, leaving ministers scrambling to find further savings. Ms Reeves is now expected to announce that universal credit (UC) incapacity benefits for new claimants, which were halved under the original plan, will also be frozen until 2030 rather than rising in line with inflation As originally reported by The Times, there will also be a small reduction in the basic rate of UC in 2029, with the new measures expected to raise £500m. A Whitehall source told Sky's political editor Beth Rigby that it is \"hard to tell how MPs will react\", as while the OBR's assessment means fewer people will be affected by the PIP changes than thought, they \"might be unhappy about the chaotic nature of it all\". The government did not publish an impact assessment of the crackdown on benefits it announced last week, saying that would come alongside the spring statement on Wednesday. Several Labour MPs criticised the measures as pushing more sick and disabled people into poverty, while former Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn called the package a \"disgrace\" on Tuesday and accused the government of imposing austerity on the country. Watch and follow the spring statement live across Sky News from 11am  Spending cuts expected Ms Reeves is expected to announce a large package of departmental spending cuts when she gives an update on the economy on Wednesday, potentially putting her on a further collision course with her own MPs. Having only committed to doing one proper budget each year in the autumn, the spring statement was meant to be a low-key affair. However, a turbulent economic climate since October means the OBR is widely expected to downgrade its growth forecasts for the UK while the government has borrowed more than previously expected. This has wiped out the £9.9bn gap in her fiscal headroom Ms Reeves left herself at her budget last year - money she needs to make up if she wants to stick to her self-imposed fiscal rule that day-to-day spending must be funded through tax receipts, not debt, by 2029-30. The chancellor has sought to blame global factors but the Conservatives blame measures like the national insurance tax hike on employers, saying this is choking business. Shadow chancellor Mel Stride urged Ms Reeves to \"use the emergency budget\" to \"fix her own mistakes and end Labour's war on enterprise\". Ms Reeves will defend her record in the spring statement, saying she is \"proud\" of what Labour has achieved in its first nine months in office. However, on the eve of the statement, polling showed the public is pessimistic about what is to come. According to More in Common, half think the cost of living crisis will never end, while YouGov found three-quarters of people want to see a tax on the richest over spending cuts. Ms Reeves is not expected to announce any tax hikes, having said her tax-raising budget in October was a once-in-a-parliament event. Read more:Chancellor can make decisions now without too much falloutExpect different focus from Reeves at spring statement Defence increase to 'deliver security' In a bid to fend off criticism, she will also announce an extra £2.2bn will be spent on defence over the next year to \"deliver security for working people\". The money is part of the government's aim to hike defence spending to 2.5% of the UK's economic output by 2027 - up from the 2.3% where it stands now. Ms Reeves will insist this plan, set out by the prime minister in February, was the \"right decision\" against the backdrop of global instability, saying it will put \"an extra 6.4bn into the defence budget by 2027\". \"This increase in investment is not just about increasing our national security but increasing our economic security, too,\" she will say. The money is coming from reductions to the international aid budget and Treasury reserves, and will be used to invest in new technology, refurbish homes for military families and upgrade HM Naval Base Portsmouth."

        "Content": "\n          Political editor\n              @BethRigby\n Rachel Reeves will keep her remarks short when she delivers the spring statement today. But the enormity of what she is saying will be lost on no one as the chancellor sets out the grim reality of the country's finances. Her economic update to the House of Commons will reveal a deteriorating economic outlook and rising borrowing costs, which has forced her to find spending cuts, which she's left others to carry the can for (more on that in a bit). Politics latest: Polling suggests almost everyone is pessimistic The independent Office of Budget Responsibility (OBR) is expected to forecast that growth for 2025 has halved from 2% to 1%. That, combined with rising debt repayment costs on government borrowing, has left the chancellor with a black hole in the public finances against the forecasts published at the budget in October. Back then, Reeves had a £9.9bn cushion against her \"iron-clad\" fiscal rule that day-to-day spending must be funded through tax receipts not debt by 2029-30. \n                  UK's fiscal position as tight as ever but expect a different focus from Rachel Reeves at the spring statement\n                 \n                  Voluntary exit schemes under way across government departments ahead of Rachel Reeves' spending cuts\n                 \n                  When is the spring statement - and what do you need to know about it?\n                 But that surplus has been wiped out in the ensuing six months - now she finds herself about £4bn in the red, according to those familiar with the forecasts. That's really uncomfortable for a chancellor who just months ago executed the biggest tax and spend budget in a generation with the promise that she would get the economy growing again. At the first progress check, she looks to be failing and has been forced into finding spending cuts to make up the shortfall after ruling out her other two options - further tax rises or more borrowing via a loosening of her self-imposed fiscal rules. Watch and follow the spring statement live across Sky News from 11am  'World has changed' When Reeves gets up on Wednesday, she will put it differently, saying the \"world has changed\" and all that means is the government must move \"further and faster\" to deliver the reforms that will drive growth. But her opponents will be quick to lay economic woes at her door, arguing that the unexpected £25bn tax hike on employers' national insurance contributions last October have choked off growth. But it's not just opposition from the Conservative benches that the chancellor is facing - it is opposition from within as she sets about cutting government spending to the tune of £15bn to fill that black hole. Politically, her allies know how awkward it would have been for the chancellor to announce £5bn in welfare cuts to avoid breaking her own fiscal rules, with one acknowledging that those cuts had to be kept separate from the spring statement. There's also expected to be more than £5bn of extra cuts from public spending in the forecast period, which could see departments that don't have protected budgets - education, justice, home - face real-term spending cuts by the end of the decade. Not an emergency budget We won't see the detail of that until the Spending Review in June. This is not an emergency budget because the chancellor isn't embarking on a round of tax raising to fix the public finances. But these are, however they are framed, emergency spending cuts designed to plug her black hole and that is politically difficult for a government that has promised no return to austerity if some parts of the public sector face deep cuts to stick with fiscal rules. If that's the macro picture, what about the \"everyday economics\" of peoples' lives? I'd point out two things here. On Wednesday, we will get to see where those £5bn of welfare cuts will fall as the government publishes the impact assessment that it held back last week. Read more:Corbyn brands benefit cuts a 'disgrace'Expect different focus from Reeves at spring statement Up to a million people could be affected by cuts, and the reality of who will be hit will pile on the pressure for Labour MPs already uncomfortable with cuts to health and disability benefits.  The second point is whether the government remains on course to deliver its key pledge to \"put more money in the pockets of working people\" during this parliament after the Joseph Rowntree Foundation think-tank produced analysis over the weekend saying living standards for all UK families are set to fall by 2030. The chancellor told my colleague Trevor Phillips on Sunday that she \"rejects\" the analysis that the average family could be £1,400 worse off by 2030. But that doesn't mean that the forecasts published on Wednesday calculating real household disposable income per head won't make for grim reading as the economic outlook deteriorates. Nervousness in Labour Ask around the party, and there is obvious nervousness about how this might land, with a degree of anxiety about the economic outlook and what that has in store for departmental budgets. But there is recognition too from many MPs that the government has political space afforded by that whopping majority, to make these decisions on spending cuts without too much fallout - for now. Because while Wednesday will be bad, worse could be yet to come. Staring down the barrel The chancellor is staring down the barrel of a possible global trade war that will only serve to create more economic uncertainty, even if the UK is spared from the worst tariffs by President Donald Trump. The national insurance hike is also set to kick in next month, with employers across the piece sounding the warnings around investment, jobs and growth. Six months ago, Reeves said she wouldn't be coming back for more after she announced £40bn in tax rises in that massive first budget. Six months on she is coming back for more, this time in the form of spending cuts. And in six months' time, she may well have to come back for more in the form of tax rises or deeper cuts. The spring statement was meant to be a run-of-the-mill economic update, but it has morphed into much more. The chancellor now has to make the hard sell from a very hard place, that could soon become even tougher still."

        "Content": " Donald Trump has been urged to fire US Secretary of Defence Pete Hegseth following the leak of highly sensitive war plans - as national security adviser Mike Waltz said he took \"full responsibility\" for organising the group chat. The conversation on the messaging app Signal between US officials, including vice president JD Vance and Mr Hegseth, was leaked to American journalist Jeffrey Goldberg, who was added to the chat in error. They discussed plans to conduct airstrikes on Yemen's Iran-backed Houthis, which took place on 15 March. Latest: White House deflecting from scandal Mr Waltz - who had mistakenly added Mr Goldberg to the Signal discussion - said: \"I take full responsibility...I built the group.\" Democratic congressman Hakeem Jeffries, minority leader of the US House of Representatives, described Mr Hegseth as \"the most unqualified Secretary of Defence in American history\" and called for him to be sacked. \"His continued presence in the top position of leadership at the Pentagon threatens the nation's security and puts our brave men and women in uniform throughout the world in danger,\" he wrote. \n                  Why artists are boycotting Kennedy Center over changes made by Trump\n                 \n                  Ukraine war: Russia accused of 'hollow' peace talks as strike injures dozens including children\n                 \n                  Trump officials discussing war plans on messaging app lambasted as 'amateur hour'\n                 \"His behaviour shocks the conscience, risked American lives and likely violated the law. \"Secretary of Defence Pete Hegseth should be fired immediately.\" Speaking from the White House, Mr Trump downplayed the incident and said he believed the chat contained \"no classified information\". \"They were using an app, as I understand it, that a lot of people in government use, a lot of people in the media use,\" he told reporters. Trump expressed support for Mr Waltz, telling NBC News his national security adviser \"has learned a lesson, and he's a good man\".  The US president said officials would \"probably\" not use Signal any longer but did not agree to a full investigation of what Democrats have called a major security breach which required high-level resignations. Included in the conversation on Signal were Mr Vance, Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Mr Hegseth. Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard and CIA director John Ratcliffe - who were both also in the chat - testified before the Senate Intelligence Committee on Tuesday that no classified material was shared. But Democratic senators have voiced scepticism, noting that the journalist, The Atlantic editor-in-chief Jeffrey Goldberg, reported Mr Hegseth posted operational details \"including information about targets, weapons the US would be deploying, and attack sequencing\". Republican majority leader, John Thune, said on Tuesday he expected the Senate Armed Services Committee to look into Trump administration officials' use of Signal. Read more from Sky News:UK still confident over US intelligence sharingWhat was said in Trump officials' group chatWhat is Signal? And is it really secure? Meanwhile, the White House has mostly attacked the journalist responsible for the original story instead of admitting culpability. The integrity of Mr Goldberg has been repeatedly called into question. Posting on X, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt accused Mr Goldberg of sensationalising the story, and White House communications director Steven Cheung called the media coverage of the security breach a \"witch hunt\". Security and Defence Editor If a British defence minister was found to have shared details about a live military operation in an unofficial messaging group with colleagues, they would be sacked. That President Donald Trump has tried to dismiss the revelation that his top defence and security team not only did just that but accidentally included a journalist in the chat will be watched with deepening horror by US allies and growing glee by American enemies. In public, the UK government is still insisting security ties with the US are as strong as ever. But in private there will doubtless be horror - though perhaps not surprise - within Whitehall at this extraordinary lapse in the most basic operational security by the president's national security adviser, defence secretary, national intelligence chief and even the boss of the CIA. Any information about plans to - for example - launch bombing raids against Iranian-backed Houthi militants in Yemen would ordinarily only be shared on specially designated government systems that ensure classified information is secure. The fact that Mike Waltz, the national security adviser, felt it was acceptable to set up a group on the commercial messaging app Signal - which does provide encryption but is only as secure as the device that it is being used on (so not secure at all if a mobile phone or laptop is compromised) - to discuss plans to attack the Houthis is bad enough. Read more from Deborah here The Atlantic has hit back, dismissing those claims. \"Attempts to disparage and discredit The Atlantic, our editor, and our reporting follow an obvious playbook by elected officials and others in power who are hostile to journalists and the First Amendment rights of all Americans,\" it said in a statement. Mr Hegseth told reporters on Monday no one had texted war plans - prompting Mr Goldberg to call those comments a lie during an interview on CNN. 👉 Follow Trump 100 on your podcast app 👈 It remains unclear why the officials chose to chat via Signal instead of secure government channels typically used for sensitive discussions. The Pentagon reportedly warned of a known vulnerability on the Signal chat app, in an email sent out prior to the publication of The Atlantic article, according to reports by Sky News' US partner network NBC News. The email reported: \"Russia-aligned threat groups are actively targeting the Signal Messenger application of individuals likely to exchange sensitive military and government communications related to the war in Ukraine\". Employees were told the vulnerability could be mitigated by updating to the latest version of the app and applying proper settings."

Sentebale was established in 2006 to help children and young people in southern Africa, particularly those with HIV and Aids. But the Duke of Sussex said he had been forced to step down amid a battle in the organisation between the chairwoman Dr Sophie Chandauka and the board of trustees. He released a statement with his co-founder, Prince Seeiso of Lesotho, saying they had established the charity \"in honour of our mothers\". \"With heavy hearts, we have resigned from our roles as patrons of the organisation until further notice, in support of and solidarity with the board of trustees who have had to do the same,\" they said. \"It is devastating that the relationship between the charity's trustees and the chair of the board broke down beyond repair, creating an untenable situation.\" Details of the row in the charity are unclear but it is reportedly over a decision to focus fundraising in Africa. \"What's transpired is unthinkable,\" the princes' statement added. \"We are in shock that we have to do this, but we have a continued responsibility to Sentebale's beneficiaries, so we will be sharing all of our concerns with the Charity Commission as to how this came about.\" In her own statement, Dr Chandauka said she would not be intimidated, adding: \"For me, this is not a vanity project from which I can resign when I am called to account.\" She said she had reported the trustees to the Charity Commission and that a UK court had issued an injunction to stop them removing her. \"There are people in this world who behave as though they are above the law and mistreat people, and then play the victim card and use the very press they disdain to harm people who have the courage to challenge their conduct,\" Dr Chandauka said. She added that this was a \"story of a woman who dared to blow the whistle about issues of poor governance, weak executive management, abuse of power, bullying, harassment, misogyny, misogynoir - and the cover-up that ensued\".

He was in the small African country - which has one of the world's highest rates of HIV and Aids - as recently as last October. The prince talked to young people around a campfire about the \"massive difference\" Sentebale was making. Last April, he was also pictured with Dr Chandauka at a charity polo match in Florida. Five former trustees also released a statement that said resigning was \"devastating\" but the \"result of our loss in trust and confidence in the chair of the board\". They said they were forced to quit as they could not allow Sentebale to take on the \"legal and financial burden\" of a lawsuit brought by the chairwoman \"to block us from voting her out after our request for her resignation was rejected\". They added that the decision to resign was \"not a choice willingly made, but rather something we felt forced into in order to look after the charity\"."

In a statement, they said it was \"important that sentences should truly reflect the seriousness of the crime and give victims, their families and society a sense of justice having been served\". The couple are part of Justice for Victims, a new campaign group set up by the families and loved ones of victims of serious crimes, which is being launched in parliament on Wednesday. The group was formed amid ongoing public concern about serious criminals escaping proper punishment, Justice for Victims said. \"Although nothing can alleviate the sense of loss, it is a relief to us that our daughter's murderer received a whole-life order,\" Mr and Mrs Everard said. \"It made us feel that the enormity of his crime was recognised and that our daughter's life was valued. \"We know of other families in similar circumstances who have not had this small comfort.\" Paula Hudgell, the adoptive mother of double amputee Tony Hudgell, 10, is also part of the group. Tony was just 41 days old when he was assaulted by his birth parents, an attack which caused multiple fractures and dislocations, and blunt trauma to the face, leading to organ failure, toxic shock, and sepsis. He was left untreated and in agony for 10 days. Due to the extent of his injuries, both his legs had to be amputated. Jody Simpson and her partner Anthony Smith were jailed for 10 years in 2018. Ms Hudgell said: \"When criminals abuse children they are creating a devastating impact for the rest of that child's life. \"Many decades can be spent wrestling with the aftermath. Yet perpetrators can be out of prison living a free life whilst the suffering for the victim goes on for decades. \"We need a justice system that reflects that properly.

President Trump said his administration was \"looking into\" Russia's request to lift sanctions. A senior official in the Ukrainian government, speaking anonymously to the AP news agency, said Kyiv did not agree to lifting sanctions as a condition for a maritime ceasefire. They said Russia had done nothing to have sanctions reversed.  While uncertainty remains over the terms of the Black Sea truce, the Kremlin confirmed it would honour a ceasefire on attacking energy facilities until 17 April. It said oil refineries, pipelines, power plants and substations, nuclear power plants and hydroelectric dams were all covered by the deal. It added: \"In the event of a violation of the moratorium by one of the parties, the other party has the right to consider itself free from obligations to comply with it.\" Sky News security analyst Michael Clarke said the Black Sea deal was something the US \"can boast about\" but won't massively change anything on the ground in Ukraine. \"The Russians will be quite happy about that because they'll just keep going down more and more rabbit holes,\" he said. \"Unless the Americans are prepared to pressure Russia as opposed to just keeping offering them more advantages, the war will just go on,\" added Professor Clarke.

Speaking to Mr Trump on the phone last week, he said any long-term deal would require a complete halt to intelligence sharing and military aid to Ukraine."

Daniel Heath and William Lawrence, both 22-year-old engineers at RAF Odiham in Hampshire, had been drinking when they damaged the statue at 2am after a night out in Newbury, Berkshire, on 2 March. CCTV footage played at Reading Magistrates' Court showed them approaching the statue before attempting to rip the bear off the bench, then walking away with part of the damaged bear. They carried the statue through the town and into a taxi to their base at RAF Odiham, the court heard. Heath of Oakhall Park, Thornton, West Yorkshire, and Lawrence, of John Street, Enderby, Leicestershire, were sentenced to a 12-month community order after admitting criminal damage. District judge Sam Goozee said it was \"an act of wanton vandalism\". \"Paddington Bear is a beloved cultural icon with children and adults alike,\" he said. \"He represents kindness, tolerance and promotes integration and acceptance in our society. \"His famous label attached to his duffle coat says 'please look after this bear'. \"On the night of March 2 2025, your actions were the antithesis of everything Paddington stands for. \"Your actions lacked respect and integrity, two values you should uphold as members of the armed forces.\" Read more from Sky News:Inside the online gangs where boys compete to be cruel'Staggering' number of domestic abuse victims taking own livesWorld Athletics to introduce mandatory sex testing for female competitions The Paddington Bear statue is among 23 placed across the UK and Ireland as part of the Paddington Visits Trail, the judge said. \"In what can only be described as an act of wanton vandalism, the CCTV shows the two of you forcibly remove the front facade of the Paddington statue and carry him through the town to a taxi which took you and the statute back to your base at RAF Odiham,\" Judge Goozee added. Heath and Lawrence were arrested at RAF Odiham the next day and admitted their offences in an interview with Thames Valley Police. The broken half of the Paddington Bear statue was later found hidden in the boot of Lawrence's car. It cost £5,451 to repair the statue, prosecutor Jaimie Renuka told the court. The defendants' defence lawyer Tom Brymer told the court: \"They have been stupid and they are extremely ashamed about their actions.\" The pair were ordered to pay £2,725 each towards the costs of repairing the statue and sentenced to a 12-month community order, as well as 150 hours of unpaid work \"as payback to the community for your actions\", the judge said. He added: \"Your Squadron Leader speaks of your both being committed and diligent members of the RAF despite your junior rank. \"The RAF recognise your strong promise for your future. I do not know what your futures may hold in the armed forces as a result of this conviction, that will be a matter for a different tribunal.\" The RAF are understood to be considering the court findings."

        "Content": "Former footballer Joey Barton has avoided jail for pushing his wife over and kicking her in the head. The incident happened at their home in southwest London in June 2021. Barton, 42, was convicted of assault and given a 12-week sentence, suspended for two years - meaning he will not go to prison unless he commits another offence. Georgia Barton was left with a lump on her forehead and a bleeding nose after the attack in Kew. The court heard the Bartons had been drinking with two other couples as their children slept upstairs, before an argument started over a family matter. Mrs Barton called 999 and said her husband had hit her, but later sent a letter retracting the statement. Barton was arrested in his bedroom - still drunk - on the night of the attack, Westminster Magistrates' Court was told. \n                  Chancellor Rachel Reeves expected to announce further welfare cuts in spring statement\n                 \n                  Spring statement: Rachel Reeves can make decisions on spending cuts without too much fallout for now - but worse could be yet to come\n                 \n                  Prince Harry 'in shock' as he quits Sentebale charity set up in honour of Princess Diana\n                 His wife, 38, was taken to a police station but gave a \"no comment\" interview. On Tuesday, magistrate Paul Goldspring described the ex-Man City and QPR player's story as \"vague\" and convicted him of assault after a two-day trial. Prosecutors said Mrs Barton's call to police was \"compelling evidence\" and was not the result of alcohol as she and her husband claimed. Barton previously admitted they had argued but denied anything \"physical\" occurred. Defence lawyer Simon Csoka told the court: \"There are a number of circumstances where the injury [lump] on the head] may have been sustained accidentally.\" The trial was due to take place in 2022 but was adjourned after Mrs Barton sent a letter saying her injuries were caused accidentally when a friend tried to separate the pair. The couple are still together. The magistrate acknowledged Barton had \"a record of violence\" but said it was \"not necessary to impose an immediate custodial sentence\". Barton was also ordered to pay a victim surcharge and court costs totalling £2,183. Speaking outside court, Barton said he was \"really disappointed\" with the verdict and intended to appeal the decision. Barton's career and life have been marked by numerous controversial incidents. Last year, broadcaster Jeremy Vine sued him for libel and harassment over posts on X, including one where he called him a \"big bike nonce\" and a \"pedo defender\". Earlier this year, he appeared in court charged with sending offensive messages to Vine and commentator Lucy Ward. Barton was stripped of his QPR captaincy in 2012 having been sent off during Manchester City's final-day 3-2 win after elbowing Carlos Tevez and, as he left the pitch, kicking Sergio Aguero before aiming a headbutt at Vincent Kompany."

        "Content": "\n          Political reporter\n              @fayebrownSky\n  Rachel Reeves will unveil further welfare cuts in her spring statement after being told the reforms announced last week will save less than planned, Sky News understands. The Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) has rejected the government's assessment that the package of measures, including narrowing the eligibility criteria for personal independence payments (PIP), will save £5bn. Politics latest: Ex-Labour leader says Starmer 'an enormous disappointment' The fiscal watchdog put the value of the cuts at £3.4bn, leaving ministers scrambling to find further savings. Ms Reeves is now expected to announce that universal credit (UC) incapacity benefits for new claimants, which were halved under the original plan, will also be frozen until 2030 rather than rising in line with inflation As originally reported by The Times, there will also be a small reduction in the basic rate of UC in 2029, with the new measures expected to raise £500m. A Whitehall source told Sky's political editor Beth Rigby that it is \"hard to tell how MPs will react\", as while the OBR's assessment means fewer people will be affected by the PIP changes than thought, they \"might be unhappy about the chaotic nature of it all\". The government did not publish an impact assessment of the crackdown on benefits it announced last week, saying that would come alongside the spring statement on Wednesday. Several Labour MPs criticised the measures as pushing more sick and disabled people into poverty, while former Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn called the package a \"disgrace\" on Tuesday and accused the government of imposing austerity on the country. Watch and follow the spring statement live across Sky News from 11am  Spending cuts expected Ms Reeves is expected to announce a large package of departmental spending cuts when she gives an update on the economy on Wednesday, potentially putting her on a further collision course with her own MPs. Having only committed to doing one proper budget each year in the autumn, the spring statement was meant to be a low-key affair. However, a turbulent economic climate since October means the OBR is widely expected to downgrade its growth forecasts for the UK while the government has borrowed more than previously expected. This has wiped out the £9.9bn gap in her fiscal headroom Ms Reeves left herself at her budget last year - money she needs to make up if she wants to stick to her self-imposed fiscal rule that day-to-day spending must be funded through tax receipts, not debt, by 2029-30. The chancellor has sought to blame global factors but the Conservatives blame measures like the national insurance tax hike on employers, saying this is choking business. Shadow chancellor Mel Stride urged Ms Reeves to \"use the emergency budget\" to \"fix her own mistakes and end Labour's war on enterprise\". Ms Reeves will defend her record in the spring statement, saying she is \"proud\" of what Labour has achieved in its first nine months in office. However, on the eve of the statement, polling showed the public is pessimistic about what is to come. According to More in Common, half think the cost of living crisis will never end, while YouGov found three-quarters of people want to see a tax on the richest over spending cuts. Ms Reeves is not expected to announce any tax hikes, having said her tax-raising budget in October was a once-in-a-parliament event. Read more:Chancellor can make decisions now without too much falloutExpect different focus from Reeves at spring statement Defence increase to 'deliver security' In a bid to fend off criticism, she will also announce an extra £2.2bn will be spent on defence over the next year to \"deliver security for working people\". The money is part of the government's aim to hike defence spending to 2.5% of the UK's economic output by 2027 - up from the 2.3% where it stands now. Ms Reeves will insist this plan, set out by the prime minister in February, was the \"right decision\" against the backdrop of global instability, saying it will put \"an extra 6.4bn into the defence budget by 2027\". \"This increase in investment is not just about increasing our national security but increasing our economic security, too,\" she will say. The money is coming from reductions to the international aid budget and Treasury reserves, and will be used to invest in new technology, refurbish homes for military families and upgrade HM Naval Base Portsmouth."

        "Content": "\n          Political editor\n              @BethRigby\n Rachel Reeves will keep her remarks short when she delivers the spring statement today. But the enormity of what she is saying will be lost on no one as the chancellor sets out the grim reality of the country's finances. Her economic update to the House of Commons will reveal a deteriorating economic outlook and rising borrowing costs, which has forced her to find spending cuts, which she's left others to carry the can for (more on that in a bit). Politics latest: Polling suggests almost everyone is pessimistic The independent Office of Budget Responsibility (OBR) is expected to forecast that growth for 2025 has halved from 2% to 1%. That, combined with rising debt repayment costs on government borrowing, has left the chancellor with a black hole in the public finances against the forecasts published at the budget in October. Back then, Reeves had a £9.9bn cushion against her \"iron-clad\" fiscal rule that day-to-day spending must be funded through tax receipts not debt by 2029-30. \n                  UK's fiscal position as tight as ever but expect a different focus from Rachel Reeves at the spring statement\n                 \n                  Voluntary exit schemes under way across government departments ahead of Rachel Reeves' spending cuts\n                 \n                  When is the spring statement - and what do you need to know about it?\n                 But that surplus has been wiped out in the ensuing six months - now she finds herself about £4bn in the red, according to those familiar with the forecasts. That's really uncomfortable for a chancellor who just months ago executed the biggest tax and spend budget in a generation with the promise that she would get the economy growing again. At the first progress check, she looks to be failing and has been forced into finding spending cuts to make up the shortfall after ruling out her other two options - further tax rises or more borrowing via a loosening of her self-imposed fiscal rules. Watch and follow the spring statement live across Sky News from 11am  'World has changed' When Reeves gets up on Wednesday, she will put it differently, saying the \"world has changed\" and all that means is the government must move \"further and faster\" to deliver the reforms that will drive growth. But her opponents will be quick to lay economic woes at her door, arguing that the unexpected £25bn tax hike on employers' national insurance contributions last October have choked off growth. But it's not just opposition from the Conservative benches that the chancellor is facing - it is opposition from within as she sets about cutting government spending to the tune of £15bn to fill that black hole. Politically, her allies know how awkward it would have been for the chancellor to announce £5bn in welfare cuts to avoid breaking her own fiscal rules, with one acknowledging that those cuts had to be kept separate from the spring statement. There's also expected to be more than £5bn of extra cuts from public spending in the forecast period, which could see departments that don't have protected budgets - education, justice, home - face real-term spending cuts by the end of the decade. Not an emergency budget We won't see the detail of that until the Spending Review in June. This is not an emergency budget because the chancellor isn't embarking on a round of tax raising to fix the public finances. But these are, however they are framed, emergency spending cuts designed to plug her black hole and that is politically difficult for a government that has promised no return to austerity if some parts of the public sector face deep cuts to stick with fiscal rules. If that's the macro picture, what about the \"everyday economics\" of peoples' lives? I'd point out two things here. On Wednesday, we will get to see where those £5bn of welfare cuts will fall as the government publishes the impact assessment that it held back last week. Read more:Corbyn brands benefit cuts a 'disgrace'Expect different focus from Reeves at spring statement Up to a million people could be affected by cuts, and the reality of who will be hit will pile on the pressure for Labour MPs already uncomfortable with cuts to health and disability benefits.  The second point is whether the government remains on course to deliver its key pledge to \"put more money in the pockets of working people\" during this parliament after the Joseph Rowntree Foundation think-tank produced analysis over the weekend saying living standards for all UK families are set to fall by 2030. The chancellor told my colleague Trevor Phillips on Sunday that she \"rejects\" the analysis that the average family could be £1,400 worse off by 2030. But that doesn't mean that the forecasts published on Wednesday calculating real household disposable income per head won't make for grim reading as the economic outlook deteriorates. Nervousness in Labour Ask around the party, and there is obvious nervousness about how this might land, with a degree of anxiety about the economic outlook and what that has in store for departmental budgets. But there is recognition too from many MPs that the government has political space afforded by that whopping majority, to make these decisions on spending cuts without too much fallout - for now. Because while Wednesday will be bad, worse could be yet to come. Staring down the barrel The chancellor is staring down the barrel of a possible global trade war that will only serve to create more economic uncertainty, even if the UK is spared from the worst tariffs by President Donald Trump. The national insurance hike is also set to kick in next month, with employers across the piece sounding the warnings around investment, jobs and growth. Six months ago, Reeves said she wouldn't be coming back for more after she announced £40bn in tax rises in that massive first budget. Six months on she is coming back for more, this time in the form of spending cuts. And in six months' time, she may well have to come back for more in the form of tax rises or deeper cuts. The spring statement was meant to be a run-of-the-mill economic update, but it has morphed into much more. The chancellor now has to make the hard sell from a very hard place, that could soon become even tougher still."

Sentebale was established in 2006 to help children and young people in southern Africa, particularly those with HIV and Aids. But the Duke of Sussex said he had been forced to step down amid a battle in the organisation between the chairwoman Dr Sophie Chandauka and the board of trustees. He released a statement with his co-founder, Prince Seeiso of Lesotho, saying they had established the charity \"in honour of our mothers\". \"With heavy hearts, we have resigned from our roles as patrons of the organisation until further notice, in support of and solidarity with the board of trustees who have had to do the same,\" they said. \"It is devastating that the relationship between the charity's trustees and the chair of the board broke down beyond repair, creating an untenable situation.\" Details of the row in the charity are unclear but it is reportedly over a decision to focus fundraising in Africa. \"What's transpired is unthinkable,\" the princes' statement added. \"We are in shock that we have to do this, but we have a continued responsibility to Sentebale's beneficiaries, so we will be sharing all of our concerns with the Charity Commission as to how this came about.\" In her own statement, Dr Chandauka said she would not be intimidated, adding: \"For me, this is not a vanity project from which I can resign when I am called to account.\" She said she had reported the trustees to the Charity Commission and that a UK court had issued an injunction to stop them removing her. \"There are people in this world who behave as though they are above the law and mistreat people, and then play the victim card and use the very press they disdain to harm people who have the courage to challenge their conduct,\" Dr Chandauka said. She added that this was a \"story of a woman who dared to blow the whistle about issues of poor governance, weak executive management, abuse of power, bullying, harassment, misogyny, misogynoir - and the cover-up that ensued\".

The prince talked to young people around a campfire about the \"massive difference\" Sentebale was making. Last April, he was also pictured with Dr Chandauka at a charity polo match in Florida. Five former trustees also released a statement that said resigning was \"devastating\" but the \"result of our loss in trust and confidence in the chair of the board\". They said they were forced to quit as they could not allow Sentebale to take on the \"legal and financial burden\" of a lawsuit brought by the chairwoman \"to block us from voting her out after our request for her resignation was rejected\". They added that the decision to resign was \"not a choice willingly made, but rather something we felt forced into in order to look after the charity\"."

In a statement, they said it was \"important that sentences should truly reflect the seriousness of the crime and give victims, their families and society a sense of justice having been served\". The couple are part of Justice for Victims, a new campaign group set up by the families and loved ones of victims of serious crimes, which is being launched in parliament on Wednesday. The group was formed amid ongoing public concern about serious criminals escaping proper punishment, Justice for Victims said. \"Although nothing can alleviate the sense of loss, it is a relief to us that our daughter's murderer received a whole-life order,\" Mr and Mrs Everard said. \"It made us feel that the enormity of his crime was recognised and that our daughter's life was valued. \"We know of other families in similar circumstances who have not had this small comfort.\" Paula Hudgell, the adoptive mother of double amputee Tony Hudgell, 10, is also part of the group. Tony was just 41 days old when he was assaulted by his birth parents, an attack which caused multiple fractures and dislocations, and blunt trauma to the face, leading to organ failure, toxic shock, and sepsis. He was left untreated and in agony for 10 days. Due to the extent of his injuries, both his legs had to be amputated. Jody Simpson and her partner Anthony Smith were jailed for 10 years in 2018. Ms Hudgell said: \"When criminals abuse children they are creating a devastating impact for the rest of that child's life. \"Many decades can be spent wrestling with the aftermath. Yet perpetrators can be out of prison living a free life whilst the suffering for the victim goes on for decades. \"We need a justice system that reflects that properly.

Daniel Heath and William Lawrence, both 22-year-old engineers at RAF Odiham in Hampshire, had been drinking when they damaged the statue at 2am after a night out in Newbury, Berkshire, on 2 March. CCTV footage played at Reading Magistrates' Court showed them approaching the statue before attempting to rip the bear off the bench, then walking away with part of the damaged bear. They carried the statue through the town and into a taxi to their base at RAF Odiham, the court heard. Heath of Oakhall Park, Thornton, West Yorkshire, and Lawrence, of John Street, Enderby, Leicestershire, were sentenced to a 12-month community order after admitting criminal damage. District judge Sam Goozee said it was \"an act of wanton vandalism\". \"Paddington Bear is a beloved cultural icon with children and adults alike,\" he said. \"He represents kindness, tolerance and promotes integration and acceptance in our society. \"His famous label attached to his duffle coat says 'please look after this bear'. \"On the night of March 2 2025, your actions were the antithesis of everything Paddington stands for. \"Your actions lacked respect and integrity, two values you should uphold as members of the armed forces.\" Read more from Sky News:Inside the online gangs where boys compete to be cruel'Staggering' number of domestic abuse victims taking own livesWorld Athletics to introduce mandatory sex testing for female competitions The Paddington Bear statue is among 23 placed across the UK and Ireland as part of the Paddington Visits Trail, the judge said. \"In what can only be described as an act of wanton vandalism, the CCTV shows the two of you forcibly remove the front facade of the Paddington statue and carry him through the town to a taxi which took you and the statute back to your base at RAF Odiham,\" Judge Goozee added. Heath and Lawrence were arrested at RAF Odiham the next day and admitted their offences in an interview with Thames Valley Police. The broken half of the Paddington Bear statue was later found hidden in the boot of Lawrence's car. It cost £5,451 to repair the statue, prosecutor Jaimie Renuka told the court. The defendants' defence lawyer Tom Brymer told the court: \"They have been stupid and they are extremely ashamed about their actions.\" The pair were ordered to pay £2,725 each towards the costs of repairing the statue and sentenced to a 12-month community order, as well as 150 hours of unpaid work \"as payback to the community for your actions\", the judge said. He added: \"Your Squadron Leader speaks of your both being committed and diligent members of the RAF despite your junior rank. \"The RAF recognise your strong promise for your future.

        "Content": "A farmer whose cows charged at a rambler, trampling him to death, had been investigated for manslaughter but no charges were brought, an inquest has heard. Malcolm Flynn, 72, from Carlisle, was walking a section of Hadrian's Wall in Northumberland with a friend when they were confronted and attacked by cattle in a field at Thirlwall Castle Farm near Gilsland in September 2020. The inquest into Mr Flynn's death heard that another two walkers were attacked by cows a year earlier in September 2019 on land farmed by Robert Scott. Jurors at the hearing in Morpeth, Northumberland, were told that in that case, the pair were not badly injured, but it led to a Health and Safety Executive inspection and enforcement action. Mr Scott then erected warning signs to alert ramblers walking through fields that cows with calves could be unpredictable and an alternative route should be taken if necessary. But he was told he could not fence off the path as it could disturb the ancient monument or any archaeology from the Roman wall, the inquest was told. At the time, Mr Scott kept 80 beef cattle and 500 sheep on the 250-hectare farm, close to the border with Cumbria, and more than 80% of the fields had public rights of way going through them. \n                  Rambler killed after cattle flipped him into air along Hadrian's Wall in Northumberland, inquest hears\n                 \n                  Boy, 15, from Northumberland, set to appear in court charged with preparing act of terrorism\n                 \n                  Northumberland: Burglar who triggered 'Home Alone-style trap' is jailed\n                 The inquest previously heard Mr Flynn was walking with a friend in September 2020 when they noticed a warning sign about cattle as they entered a field at Thirlwall Castle Farm along the Pennine Way - part of which follows Hadrian's Wall. Mr Flynn was knocked to the ground, trampled and kicked in the head by the herd of Limousin cattle - consisting of 18 cows, their calves and a bull - which only dispersed when the air ambulance flew over around 30 minutes later. He could not be saved and died from chest injuries.

Mr Scott told the inquest that he has reduced his herd from 80 to 55 since Mr Flynn was trampled and no cattle were now put in fields that had public rights of way in them, unless the paths were fenced off. Asked about the general temperament of his Limousin cattle, Mr Scott said: \"There is a perception that they may be a little bit more highly strung but I have never found it. When we had the Galloway cows, they were no different.\" Mr Flynn, a father of two, was a member of the Ramblers' Association and regularly walked with his friend.

President Trump said his administration was \"looking into\" Russia's request to lift sanctions. A senior official in the Ukrainian government, speaking anonymously to the AP news agency, said Kyiv did not agree to lifting sanctions as a condition for a maritime ceasefire. They said Russia had done nothing to have sanctions reversed.  While uncertainty remains over the terms of the Black Sea truce, the Kremlin confirmed it would honour a ceasefire on attacking energy facilities until 17 April. It said oil refineries, pipelines, power plants and substations, nuclear power plants and hydroelectric dams were all covered by the deal. It added: \"In the event of a violation of the moratorium by one of the parties, the other party has the right to consider itself free from obligations to comply with it.\" Sky News security analyst Michael Clarke said the Black Sea deal was something the US \"can boast about\" but won't massively change anything on the ground in Ukraine. \"The Russians will be quite happy about that because they'll just keep going down more and more rabbit holes,\" he said. \"Unless the Americans are prepared to pressure Russia as opposed to just keeping offering them more advantages, the war will just go on,\" added Professor Clarke.

Two statements from the White House - one about negotiations with Ukraine, another about negotiations with Russia. A version from Ukraine's president and another from the Kremlin. Follow live: Black Sea ceasefire deal reached after Saudi talks Analysing the substance of the US-brokered agreement between Russia and Ukraine requires a sifting of the spin from all sides. The read-outs from the White House are almost word-for-word, basically just swapping out the names of each country and each president. But there are notable differences between Ukraine's take and Russia's take on what they each signed up to. Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy focuses on the potential involvement of third countries to support the implementation of the agreements. We know he does not trust Vladimir Putin, but it sounds like he doesn't trust Donald Trump either. The Kremlin, on the other hand, focuses on the lifting of sanctions against companies exporting food and fertiliser. In fact, Moscow says those sanctions must go before any ceasefire begins. If that's what Moscow expects, there is one big winner: Mr Putin. Explainer: What is in the Black Sea ceasefire deal Ceasefires around energy infrastructure and in the Black Sea are progress, but not the peace Mr Trump promised, and at what price? The man who said he would end the war within a day of taking office won't win the Nobel Peace Prize for this. Asked how the ceasefire would be monitored, Mr Trump replied: \"Well, they're going to get together. \"… there's tremendous animosity, there's a lot of hatred you can probably tell, and it allows for people to get together, mediate it, arbitrate it, and see if we can get it stopped, and I think it will.\" More words, but ultimately it comes down to actions - the extent to which ceasefires are observed."

But what is the Black Sea deal - and is it a full ceasefire? Follow live: Black Sea ceasefire deal reached after Saudi talks What is in the Black Sea ceasefire deal? These are the main aspects of the deal set out by the US: • The US and Russia have agreed to safe navigation in the Black Sea, which had been a key focus of talks this week• Additionally, they agreed to work together on measures banning strikes on energy infrastructure in Russia and Ukraine• Washington will also help to restore Russia's access to global markets for agricultural and fertiliser exports, the White House said - although where this leaves Western sanctions against Russia is unclear at this stage. The US also said it has agreed it will remain committed to returning forcibly transferred Ukrainian children. Ukraine's defence minister Rustem Umerov confirmed the agreement, but added that Kyiv maintains any movement by Russian military vessels outside of eastern part of the Black Sea will constitute violation of the spirit of this agreement. \"In this case Ukraine will have full right to exercise right to self-defence,\" he said. He added: \"All parties agreed to develop measures for implementing the presidents' agreement to ban strikes against energy facilities of Ukraine and Russia.\" The Kremlin has confirmed that it has agreed to the ceasefire but there has been a disagreement over the timing and conditions. While Volodymyr Zelenskyy said he understood the ceasefire would start immediately after the US announcement, Moscow has countered, saying it will only come into force after Western sanctions are lifted against companies involved in food and fertiliser exports. How significant is this? The deal won't do much to end the war, according to Sky News' security analyst Michael Clarke. He says Russia will be quite happy dragging the US through peace talks without making any meaningful concessions. The deal is one the US \"can boast about\" - without it changing much on the ground for Ukraine, he says. \"The Russians will be quite happy about that because they'll just keep going down more and more rabbit holes and they'll present little gains for the US,\" he explains. \"But they won't address the central issue,\" he says. No real deal can be agreed unless Donald Trump starts putting meaningful pressure on Vladimir Putin, he says. \"Unless the Americans are prepared to pressure Russia as opposed to just keeping offering them more advantages, the war will just go on.\" He also says Mr Trump will stay interested until it \"gets difficult\", at which point he'll \"just go onto something else\". \"He's a disrupter, but when disruption becomes hard to follow through, he goes on to the next topic, and I think that's what will happen.\" Why is Russia willing to agree to a ceasefire at sea now? Under the ceasefire at sea, Russia would once again be able to export farm produce and fertiliser through the Black Sea, getting relief from sanctions imposed by Western countries. The US even referred to helping Russia access the world market again for agricultural products in its statement. According to Prof Clarke, Russia is happy to continue fighting on land, where it is slowly making gains, while signing up to something that protects its ships at sea - where Ukraine has been growing in confidence and damaging Russian vessels. And it helps with Russia's goal of getting its equipment out of the Black Sea.

Today's agreement has come in the midst of negotiations between Russia, the US and Ukraine in Riyadh in recent days centred on the Black Sea. But the basis of the negotiations was a deal to secure shipping there that collapsed more than 18 months ago. That UN-backed deal was negotiated in July 2022 between Turkey, the UN and Russia as a way of ensuring that Ukraine, one of the breadbaskets of the world, could keep exporting grain via its southern ports without being attacked. It was known as the Black Sea grain initiative. That deal benefited Russia, as it also allowed for greater Russian agricultural exports - but but Moscow pulled out of the initiative in July 2023 after accusing the West of reneging on this part of the agreement. This meant Russia stopped granting safe passage to cargo ships going to and from Ukraine, and the country's grain exports subsequently slumped. But Russia is now said to be keen to revive parts of the grain deal. What happened the last time Ukraine and Russia had a ceasefire agreement? Last week, Mr Putin agreed to an immediate 30-day pause in strikes on Ukrainian energy infrastructure. However, within 24 hours Ukraine and Russia accused the other of breaking the pledge."

        "Content": "\n          Sports correspondent\n              @RobHarris\n  World Athletics will introduce mandatory testing for anyone entering female competitions to verify their biological sex, insisting it is necessary to protect women's sport. It is the latest move overseen by Sebastian Coe - as president of the governing body - to address the gender eligibility issue, two years after banning anyone assigned male at birth from female events. Lord Coe said after a World Athletics Council meeting today that they could adopt non-invasive cheek swab tests or dry blood tests that only have to be carried out once on an athlete. \"This we feel is a really important way of providing confidence and maintaining that absolute focus on the integrity of competition,\" he said. The tests would seek to verify if someone has transitioned to a female after going through male puberty or if they had differences of sex development that provided testosterone advantages. Testing providers are now being sought. Lord Coe said: \"The pre-clearance testing will be for athletes to be able to compete in the female category. \"The process is very straightforward frankly, very clear and it's an important one and we will work on the timelines. \"Neither of these are invasive. They are necessary and they will be done to absolute medical standards.\" Sports correspondent Sebastian Coe's mission has become - in his view - protecting the integrity of women's sport. Having banned transgender women from women's events overseen by World Athletics, any competitors with differences of sex development will also be prohibited from competing alongside those who were female at birth. Lord Coe believes he is trying to prevent any unfair performance advantage gained by anyone who has gone through male puberty.\n And his solution to verifying eligibility is sex testing - part of the Olympics in the last century. He insists the new swab tests for all female athletes will be non-intrusive, checking if there's any presence of the SRY gene that is typically found on the Y chromosome.\n But Alun Williams, of the Manchester Metropolitan University Institute of Sport, is part of a group of global academics expressing concern that the initial genetic test could lead to clinical examinations of bodies. The new tests, though, could be in place in time for the World Athletics Championships in Tokyo in September and be a requirement for every female competitor. Will the tests be adopted by other sports that have already banned transgender women from women's events? And, ultimately, under pressure from Donald Trump, will they be widespread for 2028 LA Olympics hopefuls? It follows US President Donald Trump, ahead of the 2028 Los Angeles Olympics, saying there are only two sexes - male and female - while calling on sports to ban transgender women from women's events. The International Olympic Committee has previously called a return to sex testing a \"bad idea\", but incoming IOC President Kirsty Coventry is not ruling it out, having also talked about protecting the female category.  \"This is a conversation that's happened and the international federations have taken a far greater lead in this conversation,\" she told Sky News after her election last week. \"What I was proposing is to bring a group together with the international federations and really understand each sport is slightly different. \"We know in equestrian, sex is really not an issue, but in other sports it is. \"So what I'd like to do again is bring the international federations together and sit down and try and come up with a collective way forward for all of us to move.\" Read more: New IOC president must deal with Trump, Putin and transgender issue Reem Alsalem, the UN's special rapporteur on violence against women and girls, last year called on the IOC to reintroduce sex testing for female athletes to protect them from injuries amid concerns about eligibility. The IOC introduced \"certificates of femininity\" at the 1968 Mexico Games. But those chromosome-based tests were deemed unscientific and unethical and dropped ahead of Sydney 2000."

A public prosecutor has said that \"two adult children\" of the couple have also been arrested on the same charge of \"voluntary homicide\". All four were also detained on charges of \"handling of a corpse\". Emile Soleil was two years old when he was last seen walking down a street near his grandparents' home in Le Vernet in Alpes-de-Haute-Provence on 8 July 2023. The French toddler was staying with his maternal grandparents for the summer holidays and his mother and father were not in the village when he disappeared. The case, which began as a missing person investigation, soon became a criminal inquiry into a possible abduction, although police did not rule out murder, an accident or a fall. His whereabouts were unknown until his bones, including a skull, were discovered by a walker about a mile from the village on Saturday 30 March 2024. \n                  Ukraine and Russia agree to US-brokered Black Sea ceasefire - but Zelenskyy says Moscow already playing games \n                 \n                  Donald Trump urged to fire US defence secretary Pete Hegseth over war plans leak\n                 \n                  Ukraine war latest: Russia and Ukraine appear to disagree on Black Sea ceasefire timing - as US report warns of long war risk\n                 Emile's cause of death remains unexplained, according to French media. Speaking nearly a year after the remains were found, public prosecutor Jean-Luc Blachon said the boy's grandparents were arrested \"along with two of their adult children\". He added that all four were \"taken into custody by investigators from the Marseille Gendarmerie's research section on charges of voluntary homicide and handling of a corpse\". Mr Blachon did not identify the grandparents' children who have been detained. A source has told French broadcaster BFM TV that they are an uncle and aunt of Emile. The four people are also reported to have been arrested at more than one location. It comes as Mr Blachon said investigators are carrying out \"forensic operations in various parts of the country\". \"A new communication will be issued at the end of the acts in progress,\" Mr Blachon added.

A journalist for French news site Le Figaro said at least one car and a trailer used to move horses was taken away by police. The developments come after a traditional Catholic funeral mass was held for Emile in Bouches-du-Rhone in February this year attended by several hundred mourners. Within hours of the ceremony, the grandparents reportedly published a statement saying: \"The period of silence must yield to the period of truth,\" adding: \"We need to understand. We need to know.\" In late November 2023, a day before Emile would have turned three, his parents Marie and Colomban Soleil published a call for answers in a Christian weekly publication, France 24 said. \"Tell us where he is,\" they wrote."

        "Content": "\n          Business and economics reporter\n              @SkyNewsBiz\n Tesla sales across Europe plunged 40% last month, raising further questions over the extent drivers are being put off by its chief executive Elon Musk's politics. Data covering the EU, Britain and European Free Trade Association (EFTA) nations on Tuesday showed a rise in overall new electric car sales during February, but Tesla lagging behind its peers. It sold fewer than 17,000 cars compared to over 28,000 in the same month in 2024, with a market share of 1.8% compared to the 2.8% seen 12 months ago. Money latest: What can we expect in the spring statement tomorrow? The European Automobile Manufacturers Association (ACEA) said Tesla had sold 42.6% fewer cars in Europe in the year to date. While total new car sales were down 3.1% on the same period in 2024, those for battery electric vehicles were 26.1% higher. The declines for Tesla were limited to the continent as the UK's industry body, the SMMT, had already flagged a 20% rise in Tesla sales during February compared to February 2024. \n                  DOGE staff getting daily death threats, says Elon Musk\n                 \n                  US defence staff could face lie detector tests in probe into leaks after Musk Pentagon visit\n                 \n                  Trump 100 Day 62: Why was Elon Musk at the Pentagon?\n                 The figures were released just hours after it was revealed that Chinese competitor BYD had overtaken its US rival in global annual revenue during 2024, despite the impact of European Union and US tariffs on Chinese-made EVs. Tesla's challenges include more intense, and cheaper, competition especially from China and a lack of budget models. It has also suffered from a lack of new models - with the mid-size Model Y yet to launch. But market commentators argue Mr Musk's intervention on behalf of right-wing political parties, seen most recently in the run-up to Germany's national elections in which he publicly urged Germans to vote for the AfD, have contributed significantly to the sales decline.  Tesla's sales in Germany were more than 70% lower in February - the month of the election. Mr Musk's alignment with Donald Trump in the United States, in which the Tesla boss has led efforts to shrink Federal government spending including through controversial job cuts, has prompted boycotts at home. US figures released last week showed Tesla customers trading in their cars at record levels. There have been violent protests too, with the FBI now investigating a series of attacks on Tesla interests including dealerships. Mr Musk has led funding and job-cutting measures at the newly created Department of Government Effeciency (DOGE), claiming he is seeking to stop government waste, fraud, and abuse. Critics say his aim is to destroy government departments and ultimately to consolidate his wealth and power.  Republican supporters have dubbed Musk's opponents \"Tesla terrorists\". The most recent reported attack was seen in Austin, Texas, on Monday. Local police say several \"incendiary devices\" were found and made safe on a sales forecourt. Shares in the company lost more than 50% of their market value - a hit worth around $800bn - between December and early March as investors fretted on several fronts, including over the attacks and tariffs. Another concern was that the company had lost its focus, given the expanding demands on its chief executive's time.  One of Tesla's most longstanding shareholders told Sky News last week that Mr Musk should step aside unless he quit his Trump administration interests. The president himself has attempted to help Mr Mush stop the rot by buying a Tesla car in a public show of support. Tesla shares staged a rally of almost 12% on Monday - partly aided by growing evidence that Mr Trump could exclude the auto sector from new tariffs from 2 April. Ahmad Assiri, research strategist at the brokerage Pepperstone, said of the challenges facing Tesla: \"Musk's political engagement has triggered a significant backlash, notably evident through explicit calls for boycotts, negatively impacting Tesla's reputation among substantial segments of consumers and investors, particularly given the implicit political biases. \"This situation further complicates management's position in handling this adverse environment.\" He added: \"Concurrently, China's BYD continues to gain considerable traction in the EV market, recording rapid growth and becoming increasingly attractive to consumers and investors alike. \"This intensifying competition directly threatens Tesla's market share\"."

The Lion Rescue Centre was officially opened at The Big Cat Sanctuary in Smarden, Kent, on Tuesday by the charity's ambassador - Bake Off star Paul Hollywood. A fundraising campaign collected £500,000 to build the centre which is the home for the lions Rori, Amani, Lira, Vanda and Yuna. All five were found near the frontline in Ukraine, neglected and abandoned by their owners. Yuna, a three-year-old female, was rescued after living in a 3x4 metre enclosure with a bare concrete floor.

Rori, Amani, Lira and Vanda, who arrived at the Big Cat Sanctuary this month after a 12-hour journey by road and ferry from temporary homes at zoos and animal shelters in Belgium, while joined Yuna arrived in August. None of the lions had walked on grass until they arrived at the sanctuary in Kent. The big cats were saved by the Wild Animals Rescue Center run by Natalia Popova, a Ukrainian woman who has saved hundreds of abandoned pets and zoo animals since Russia's full-scale invasion in February 2022. Lions, tigers, leopards, wolves, deer, monkeys and more have passed through her shelter, a converted horse stables near Kyiv. A Big Cat Sanctuary spokeswoman said: \"The lions come from varying situations of neglect and abuse with four out of the five lions having never touched grass before - making their first steps out at The Lion Rescue Centre even more poignant. \"These beautiful cats have been severely neglected, confined to concrete enclosures, used for illegal breeding or kept as family pets. \"Their new habitats have been specially designed to provide each lion with the ideal environment to rest and recuperate.\" The spokeswoman added that each lion had individual needs due to their \"previous hardships\".

        "Content": " Donald Trump has been urged to fire US Secretary of Defence Pete Hegseth following the leak of highly sensitive war plans - as national security adviser Mike Waltz said he took \"full responsibility\" for organising the group chat. The conversation on the messaging app Signal between US officials, including vice president JD Vance and Mr Hegseth, was leaked to American journalist Jeffrey Goldberg, who was added to the chat in error. They discussed plans to conduct airstrikes on Yemen's Iran-backed Houthis, which took place on 15 March. Latest: White House deflecting from scandal Mr Waltz - who had mistakenly added Mr Goldberg to the Signal discussion - said: \"I take full responsibility...I built the group.\" Democratic congressman Hakeem Jeffries, minority leader of the US House of Representatives, described Mr Hegseth as \"the most unqualified Secretary of Defence in American history\" and called for him to be sacked. \"His continued presence in the top position of leadership at the Pentagon threatens the nation's security and puts our brave men and women in uniform throughout the world in danger,\" he wrote. \n                  Why artists are boycotting Kennedy Center over changes made by Trump\n                 \n                  Ukraine war: Russia accused of 'hollow' peace talks as strike injures dozens including children\n                 \n                  Trump officials discussing war plans on messaging app lambasted as 'amateur hour'\n                 \"His behaviour shocks the conscience, risked American lives and likely violated the law. \"Secretary of Defence Pete Hegseth should be fired immediately.\" Speaking from the White House, Mr Trump downplayed the incident and said he believed the chat contained \"no classified information\". \"They were using an app, as I understand it, that a lot of people in government use, a lot of people in the media use,\" he told reporters. Trump expressed support for Mr Waltz, telling NBC News his national security adviser \"has learned a lesson, and he's a good man\".  The US president said officials would \"probably\" not use Signal any longer but did not agree to a full investigation of what Democrats have called a major security breach which required high-level resignations. Included in the conversation on Signal were Mr Vance, Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Mr Hegseth. Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard and CIA director John Ratcliffe - who were both also in the chat - testified before the Senate Intelligence Committee on Tuesday that no classified material was shared. But Democratic senators have voiced scepticism, noting that the journalist, The Atlantic editor-in-chief Jeffrey Goldberg, reported Mr Hegseth posted operational details \"including information about targets, weapons the US would be deploying, and attack sequencing\". Republican majority leader, John Thune, said on Tuesday he expected the Senate Armed Services Committee to look into Trump administration officials' use of Signal. Read more from Sky News:UK still confident over US intelligence sharingWhat was said in Trump officials' group chatWhat is Signal? And is it really secure? Meanwhile, the White House has mostly attacked the journalist responsible for the original story instead of admitting culpability. The integrity of Mr Goldberg has been repeatedly called into question. Posting on X, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt accused Mr Goldberg of sensationalising the story, and White House communications director Steven Cheung called the media coverage of the security breach a \"witch hunt\". Security and Defence Editor If a British defence minister was found to have shared details about a live military operation in an unofficial messaging group with colleagues, they would be sacked. That President Donald Trump has tried to dismiss the revelation that his top defence and security team not only did just that but accidentally included a journalist in the chat will be watched with deepening horror by US allies and growing glee by American enemies. In public, the UK government is still insisting security ties with the US are as strong as ever. But in private there will doubtless be horror - though perhaps not surprise - within Whitehall at this extraordinary lapse in the most basic operational security by the president's national security adviser, defence secretary, national intelligence chief and even the boss of the CIA. Any information about plans to - for example - launch bombing raids against Iranian-backed Houthi militants in Yemen would ordinarily only be shared on specially designated government systems that ensure classified information is secure. The fact that Mike Waltz, the national security adviser, felt it was acceptable to set up a group on the commercial messaging app Signal - which does provide encryption but is only as secure as the device that it is being used on (so not secure at all if a mobile phone or laptop is compromised) - to discuss plans to attack the Houthis is bad enough. Read more from Deborah here The Atlantic has hit back, dismissing those claims. \"Attempts to disparage and discredit The Atlantic, our editor, and our reporting follow an obvious playbook by elected officials and others in power who are hostile to journalists and the First Amendment rights of all Americans,\" it said in a statement. Mr Hegseth told reporters on Monday no one had texted war plans - prompting Mr Goldberg to call those comments a lie during an interview on CNN. 👉 Follow Trump 100 on your podcast app 👈 It remains unclear why the officials chose to chat via Signal instead of secure government channels typically used for sensitive discussions. The Pentagon reportedly warned of a known vulnerability on the Signal chat app, in an email sent out prior to the publication of The Atlantic article, according to reports by Sky News' US partner network NBC News. The email reported: \"Russia-aligned threat groups are actively targeting the Signal Messenger application of individuals likely to exchange sensitive military and government communications related to the war in Ukraine\". Employees were told the vulnerability could be mitigated by updating to the latest version of the app and applying proper settings."

        "Content": "\n          Political reporter\n              @alexrogerssky\n JD Vance is less liked among the UK public than Donald Trump, Sir Keir Starmer or any other major UK politician, a new poll shared with Sky News has found. Just 14% of the British public have a favourable view of the US vice president, compared with 21% for Mr Trump and 29% for the prime minister and Reform UK leader Nigel Farage. Ipsos questioned 1,132 adults aged 18 and over across Great Britain online between the 14 and 17 March - just weeks after the heated exchange between Mr Vance, Mr Trump and Volodymyr Zelenskyy in the White House over military assistance to Ukraine. Politics latest: Farage brands protester 'a saddo' The poll was carried out before a conversation on the messaging app Signal - between US officials, including the vice president - was accidentally leaked to an American journalist, who was added to the encrypted chat in error. In the conversation, Mr Vance and other officials - including National Security Adviser Michael Waltz, Secretary of State Marco Rubio and US Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth - discussed plans to conduct airstrikes on Yemen's Iran-backed Houthis, which took place on 15 March. During the discussion, Mr Vance questioned the rationale behind the military action, arguing that attacking the Houthis would largely serve European interests, with the continent benefiting from US protection of shipping lanes in the Red Sea that are a frequent target for attacks \n                  Chancellor Rachel Reeves expected to announce further welfare cuts in spring statement\n                 \n                  Spring statement: Rachel Reeves can make decisions on spending cuts without too much fallout for now - but worse could be yet to come\n                 \n                  UK's fiscal position as tight as ever but expect a different focus from Rachel Reeves at the spring statement\n                 US security breach latest: Trump dismisses war plan 'glitch' In a message addressed to Mr Hegseth, Mr Vance said: \"If you think we should do it let's go. I just hate bailing Europe out again.\" Mr Hegseth, who had made the case for military action against the Houthis, replied: \"I fully share your loathing of European free-loading. PATHETIC.\"  Keiran Pedley, Ipsos director of politics, told Sky News: \"It is clear from these numbers that Vance is unpopular with the British public. \"A majority hold an unfavourable view of the vice president, including clear majorities of Conservative, Labour and Lib Dem voters. Reform UK supporters are more split, with slightly more holding an unfavourable view than a favourable one.\" The leak of the messages to Jeffrey Goldberg, The Atlantic's editor in chief, has raised concerns about US national security and the Trump's administration's attitude towards Europe as it seeks to reach a peace deal between Russia and Ukraine to end the war.  President Trump has dismissed the significance of the accidental leaking of US military intelligence to Mr Goldberg, telling Garrett Haake, a reporter from Sky News' US partner network NBC, that the journalist was \"a sleazeball\" and that his presence on the Signal chain had \"no impact at all\". Asked how he came to be added to the chat, Mr Trump said it was one of Mr Waltz's staffers who \"had his number on there\". Asked if he still had confidence in Waltz, Trump said he did: \"Michael Waltz has learned a lesson, and he's a good man.\" Read more:Trump officials discussing war plans lambasted as 'amateur hour'DOGE staff getting daily death threats, says Elon Musk The US president also expressed confidence in his team and supported comments by his defence secretary that the story was a non-issue, arguing it was \"the only glitch in two months, and it turned out not to be a serious one\". Downing Street has also insisted it is confident any UK intelligence shared with the US was being handled appropriately. The prime minister's official spokesman said: \"The US is our closest ally when it comes to matters of defence, we have a long-standing relationship on intelligence and defence cooperation. \"We will continue to build on the very strong relationship we already have with the US on defence and security matters.\""

        "Content": " Downing Street has insisted it is confident UK intelligence shared with the US is being handled appropriately, in the wake of a high-profile security breach involving the Trump administration. Luke Pollard, the armed forces minister, told parliament that no UK personnel involved in the US operation against the Houthis on 15 March were put at risk by a reporter being accidentally included in a group chat where senior US officials discussed the airstrikes. He added that the government had \"high confidence\" that British operational security remained \"intact\", despite the breach by a crucial intelligence partner. US latest: Trump's team labelled 'complete amateurs' The Trump administration is facing calls for an investigation after Jeffrey Goldberg, the editor-in-chief of The Atlantic magazine, was added to a group which included US vice president JD Vance, defence secretary Pete Hegseth, national security adviser Mike Waltz and director of national intelligence Tulsi Gabbard. In an article headlined The Trump Administration Accidentally Texted Me Its War Plans, Mr Goldberg revealed he \"knew two hours before the first bombs exploded that the attack might be coming\".

He told the committee: \"The Ministry of Defence has very clear policies in relation to what information can be shared and the format in which it can be shared. We don't comment on how allies share their information. \"I'm confident that we have robust measures to safeguard our information and our data, but we also have a very clear set of systems where individuals don't follow procedures, with sufficient consequences to reflect the actions that have been taken.\" The minister added that there would be \"a clear consequence and disciplinary process for anyone that was not following those procedures\". 👉 Follow Trump 100 on your podcast app 👈 No10 still confident in US-UK intelligence relationship A Downing Street spokesman, meanwhile, told journalists: \"The US is our closest ally when it comes to matters of defence, we have a long-standing relationship on intelligence and defence cooperation. \"We will continue to build on the very strong relationship we already have with the US on defence and security matters.\" Asked whether the government was happy UK personnel had been involved in an operation where details had been shared with a journalist, the spokesman said he would not comment on intelligence matters.  'Trump's White House can't be trusted' The leader of the Liberal Democrats disagrees completely with the government, and is calling for a comprehensive review of the UK's intelligence sharing arrangements with the US. Sir Ed Davey said: \"Trump's White House can't be trusted to take even the most basic steps to keep its own intelligence safe. \"Their fly-by-the-seat-of-your-pants approach to security means it could only be a matter of time until our own intelligence shared with them is also leaked. This could put British lives at risk.\"  Sir Ed is not alone in his concerns, with four former US ambassadors having expressed their concerns about intelligence sharing with the US under the Trump administration. Sir David Manning, ambassador between 2003 and 2007, told a parliamentary committee that some of Mr Trump's appointees had \"strange track records\" that would create a \"problem on the intelligence front\". Dame Karen Pierce, who served through some of the first Trump presidency and left Washington last month, said intelligence sharing would continue \"even if at the top level there might be things we might wish to be circumspect about\".

        "Content": "\n          Security and Defence Editor\n              @haynesdeborah\n If a British defence minister was found to have shared details about a live military operation in an unofficial messaging group with colleagues, they would be sacked. That President Donald Trump has tried to dismiss the revelation that his top defence and security team not only did just that but accidentally included a journalist in the chat will be watched with deepening horror by US allies and growing glee by American enemies. In public, the UK government is still insisting security ties with the US are as strong as ever. US security breach latest: White House tries to distract from scandal But in private there will doubtless be horror - though perhaps not surprise - within Whitehall at this extraordinary lapse in the most basic operational security by the president's national security adviser, defence secretary, national intelligence chief and even the boss of the CIA. Any information about plans to - for example - launch bombing raids against Iranian-backed Houthi militants in Yemen would ordinarily only be shared on specially designated government systems that ensure classified information is secure. The fact that Mike Waltz, the national security adviser, felt it was acceptable to set up a group on the commercial messaging app Signal - which does provide encryption but is only as secure as the device that it is being used on (so not secure at all if a mobile phone or laptop is compromised) - to discuss plans to attack the Houthis is bad enough. \n                  Trump officials' plan to bomb Yemen's Houthis accidentally shared with journalist Jeffrey Goldberg in group chat\n                 \n                  Donald Trump launches strikes against Yemen's Houthis over Red Sea ship attacks, killing at least 31 civilians\n                 \n                  'Hundreds trapped' in West Bank hospital as Israeli troops clear roadside bombs in Jenin\n                 The subsequent mistaken inclusion of Jeffrey Goldberg, editor-in-chief of The Atlantic magazine, is a display of amateurism that simply should not happen among security professionals without serious and immediate consequences.  But perhaps the most jaw-dropping moment of all was the decision by Pete Hegseth, the defence secretary - also in the chat - to decide it was acceptable to share plans for the strikes, including specific targets, weapons and sequencing. This kind of information could actually put lives at risk if it fell into the wrong hands. What must the professional military personnel who carried out the operation be thinking - not only about the careless approach to security by their boss, but also the reaction of their president, who has played down the debacle as a \"glitch\" and not \"a serious one\"? Read more:Who were officials discussing war plans?What is the Signal app?   I asked a former British defence minister what would have happened to him if he had shared operational plans on a Signal chat. \"It just wouldn't happen,\" he said. \"Nobody would be stupid enough to share live operational detail. But if I did, I'd be fired immediately after I'd had the mother of all bollockings from the chief of the defence staff or the chief of joint operations!\" Ensuring operational and personnel security is paramount for any military plan. It is why the UK and - previously - the US, as well as other members of the Five Eyes intelligence-sharing alliance, have such strict protocols on the classification of material, who can handle what and how intelligence or other information can be distributed.  Any weakening of these strict standards would potentially allow sloppiness to grow, which increases the chance of further breaches. Russia, China, Iran and other hostile states already constantly try to access classified material from Western allies to gain an advantage and cause harm. It can hardly be in Mr Trump's interests to help them."

Two statements from the White House - one about negotiations with Ukraine, another about negotiations with Russia. A version from Ukraine's president and another from the Kremlin. Follow live: Black Sea ceasefire deal reached after Saudi talks Analysing the substance of the US-brokered agreement between Russia and Ukraine requires a sifting of the spin from all sides. The read-outs from the White House are almost word-for-word, basically just swapping out the names of each country and each president. But there are notable differences between Ukraine's take and Russia's take on what they each signed up to. Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy focuses on the potential involvement of third countries to support the implementation of the agreements. We know he does not trust Vladimir Putin, but it sounds like he doesn't trust Donald Trump either. The Kremlin, on the other hand, focuses on the lifting of sanctions against companies exporting food and fertiliser. In fact, Moscow says those sanctions must go before any ceasefire begins. If that's what Moscow expects, there is one big winner: Mr Putin. Explainer: What is in the Black Sea ceasefire deal Ceasefires around energy infrastructure and in the Black Sea are progress, but not the peace Mr Trump promised, and at what price? The man who said he would end the war within a day of taking office won't win the Nobel Peace Prize for this. Asked how the ceasefire would be monitored, Mr Trump replied: \"Well, they're going to get together. \"… there's tremendous animosity, there's a lot of hatred you can probably tell, and it allows for people to get together, mediate it, arbitrate it, and see if we can get it stopped, and I think it will.\" More words, but ultimately it comes down to actions - the extent to which ceasefires are observed."

A senior official in the Ukrainian government, speaking anonymously to the AP news agency, said Kyiv did not agree to lifting sanctions as a condition for a maritime ceasefire. They said Russia had done nothing to have sanctions reversed.  While uncertainty remains over the terms of the Black Sea truce, the Kremlin confirmed it would honour a ceasefire on attacking energy facilities until 17 April. It said oil refineries, pipelines, power plants and substations, nuclear power plants and hydroelectric dams were all covered by the deal. It added: \"In the event of a violation of the moratorium by one of the parties, the other party has the right to consider itself free from obligations to comply with it.\" Sky News security analyst Michael Clarke said the Black Sea deal was something the US \"can boast about\" but won't massively change anything on the ground in Ukraine. \"The Russians will be quite happy about that because they'll just keep going down more and more rabbit holes,\" he said. \"Unless the Americans are prepared to pressure Russia as opposed to just keeping offering them more advantages, the war will just go on,\" added Professor Clarke.

Several performers have cancelled shows at the iconic venue in Washington DC after the president made himself chairman and replaced board members with political loyalists. One musician told Sky News it was \"authoritarianism coming for arts institutions\". The Kennedy Center stage is seen as a showcase for the best of American performance art. It hosts more than 2,000 shows per year, including its annual honours ceremony, which celebrates artists who have made significant contributions to US culture. Previous honourees include Joni Mitchell, Aretha Franklin, and Led Zeppelin. Its board of trustees has traditionally been made up of appointees who span the political spectrum. However, following Trump's election, he got rid of 18 board members and replaced them with people more politically aligned with him, including his chief-of-staff Susie Wiles, and Fox presenters Laura Ingraham and Maria Bartiromo. As the new chairman of the board, Trump said of its production schedule: \"We didn't like what they were showing, we're going to make sure it's good and it's not going to be woke.\" The hit Broadway show Hamilton is among the artists and productions to cancel dates at the Kennedy Center in protest. Others include the actor and producer Issa Rae, mystery writer Louise Penny and Pulitzer Prize-winning folk musician Rhiannon Giddens.

This is authoritarianism coming for arts institutions. I'm a working artist and I won't stand for it.\" He added: \"Countries around the world have dealt with authoritarianism before. We're a young country. This is an American experiment and we do not, collectively in this country, have a memory of what authoritarianism can do. \"We're kind of sleepwalking in this country. People do not realise how bad this situation can get and it seems like a slow drip but we're moving quicker than people realise. I fear that among artists, not speaking about these changes is tacit approval. It is a capitulation.\" Trump has extended his reach into the arts world by naming his friends Mel Gibson, Jon Voight and Sylvester Stallone as \"special ambassadors\" to Hollywood \"for the purpose of… bringing Hollywood back bigger, better and stronger than ever before\". On the Kennedy Center changes, Robin Givhan, a senior critic-at-large at The Washington Post, told Sky News: \"I think what this does is it sends a message that some ideas are not welcome. But I think even more than that, it suggests that this is a president who doesn't just want to control who's performing on the stage.\" \"It's a desire to control the perceptions of the people who are sitting in the audience and to me, that is far more disturbing.\""

        "Content": "\n          Political reporter\n              @fayebrownSky\n  Rachel Reeves will unveil further welfare cuts in her spring statement after being told the reforms announced last week will save less than planned, Sky News understands. The Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) has rejected the government's assessment that the package of measures, including narrowing the eligibility criteria for personal independence payments (PIP), will save £5bn. Politics latest: Ex-Labour leader says Starmer 'an enormous disappointment' The fiscal watchdog put the value of the cuts at £3.4bn, leaving ministers scrambling to find further savings. Ms Reeves is now expected to announce that universal credit (UC) incapacity benefits for new claimants, which were halved under the original plan, will also be frozen until 2030 rather than rising in line with inflation As originally reported by The Times, there will also be a small reduction in the basic rate of UC in 2029, with the new measures expected to raise £500m. A Whitehall source told Sky's political editor Beth Rigby that it is \"hard to tell how MPs will react\", as while the OBR's assessment means fewer people will be affected by the PIP changes than thought, they \"might be unhappy about the chaotic nature of it all\". The government did not publish an impact assessment of the crackdown on benefits it announced last week, saying that would come alongside the spring statement on Wednesday. Several Labour MPs criticised the measures as pushing more sick and disabled people into poverty, while former Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn called the package a \"disgrace\" on Tuesday and accused the government of imposing austerity on the country. Watch and follow the spring statement live across Sky News from 11am  Spending cuts expected Ms Reeves is expected to announce a large package of departmental spending cuts when she gives an update on the economy on Wednesday, potentially putting her on a further collision course with her own MPs. Having only committed to doing one proper budget each year in the autumn, the spring statement was meant to be a low-key affair. However, a turbulent economic climate since October means the OBR is widely expected to downgrade its growth forecasts for the UK while the government has borrowed more than previously expected. This has wiped out the £9.9bn gap in her fiscal headroom Ms Reeves left herself at her budget last year - money she needs to make up if she wants to stick to her self-imposed fiscal rule that day-to-day spending must be funded through tax receipts, not debt, by 2029-30. The chancellor has sought to blame global factors but the Conservatives blame measures like the national insurance tax hike on employers, saying this is choking business. Shadow chancellor Mel Stride urged Ms Reeves to \"use the emergency budget\" to \"fix her own mistakes and end Labour's war on enterprise\". Ms Reeves will defend her record in the spring statement, saying she is \"proud\" of what Labour has achieved in its first nine months in office. However, on the eve of the statement, polling showed the public is pessimistic about what is to come. According to More in Common, half think the cost of living crisis will never end, while YouGov found three-quarters of people want to see a tax on the richest over spending cuts. Ms Reeves is not expected to announce any tax hikes, having said her tax-raising budget in October was a once-in-a-parliament event.

The money is part of the government's aim to hike defence spending to 2.5% of the UK's economic output by 2027 - up from the 2.3% where it stands now. Ms Reeves will insist this plan, set out by the prime minister in February, was the \"right decision\" against the backdrop of global instability, saying it will put \"an extra 6.4bn into the defence budget by 2027\". \"This increase in investment is not just about increasing our national security but increasing our economic security, too,\" she will say. The money is coming from reductions to the international aid budget and Treasury reserves, and will be used to invest in new technology, refurbish homes for military families and upgrade HM Naval Base Portsmouth."

        "Content": "\n          Economics and data editor\n              @EdConwaySky\n  Remember \"securonomics\"? It was the buzzword Rachel Reeves gave to her economic philosophy back before the election. The idea was that in the late 2020s, the old ideas about the way we run the economy would or should give way to a new model. For a long time, we ignored where something was made and by whom and just ordered it in from the cheapest source. For a long time, we ignored the security consequences of where we got our energy from. The upshot of these assumptions was that over time, we allowed our manufacturing base to become hollowed out, unable to compete with cheap imports from China. We allowed our energy system to become ever more dependent on cheap Russian gas. Money blog: Supermarket puts buying limit on new Lindt version of viral chocolate The whole point of securonomics was that it matters where something is made and who owns it. And not just that - that revitalising manufacturing and energy could help revitalise \"left-behind\" corners of the economy, places like the Midlands and the North East. Back when she came up with the coinage, Joe Biden was in power and was pumping billions of dollars into the US economy via the Inflation Reduction Act - a scheme designed to encourage green tech investment. So securonomics looked a little like the British version of Bidenomics. That's the key point: the \"security\" part of \"securonomics\" was mostly about energy security and supply chain security rather than about defence. Watch and follow the spring statement live across Sky News from 11am But when Rachel Reeves became chancellor, it looked for a period as if securonomics was dead on arrival. Most glaringly, Labour dramatically trimmed back the ambition and scale of its green investment plans. But roll on a year or so, and we all know what happened next. A new era The Democrats lost, Donald Trump won, came into office and swiftly triggered a chain reaction that panicked everyone in Europe into investing more in defence. Today, much of the focus among investors is not on net zero but on defence. All of which is to say, securonomics might be about to resurface, but in a markedly different guise. In the spring statement, I expect the chancellor to bring back this buzzword, but this time, the emphasis will not be on green tech but on something else: the defence sector. Expect to hear about weapons This time around, the chancellor will say securonomics 2.0, which is to say government investment in the defence sector will also bring an economic windfall, as old naval ports like Plymouth and Portsmouth see regeneration. This time, the focus will not be on solar and wind but on submarines and weapons. Whether this rendition of securonomics is any more successful than the last remains to be seen. For the chancellor hardly has an enormous amount of money left to invest. While this week's event is billed as a mere forecast update, the reality, when you take a step back, is more serious. Read more:What do you need to know about the spring statement The chancellor will have to acknowledge that, without remedial action, she would have broken her fiscal rules. She will have to confirm significant changes to policy to rebuild the \"headroom\" against these rules. These will stop short of tax rises. Instead, the spending envelope in future years will be trimmed (think 1.1% or so spending increases rather than 1.3% or 1.4%). Those welfare reforms announced last week will bring in a bit of extra cash. And thanks to an accounting quirk, the decision (announced a few weeks ago) to shift development spending into defence will also give her a bit more space against her rules. The austerity question But even these changes will raise further awkward questions: is this or is this not austerity? Certainly, for some departments, that spending cut will involve further significant sacrifices. Are those benefits gains really achievable, and at what cost? And, most ominously, what if the chancellor has to come back to parliament in another six months and admit she's broken her rules all over again? The return of securonomics might be the theme she wants to focus on in the coming months - but that, too, depends on having money to invest - and the UK's fiscal position looks as tight as ever."

        "Content": "\n          Political editor\n              @BethRigby\n Rachel Reeves will keep her remarks short when she delivers the spring statement today. But the enormity of what she is saying will be lost on no one as the chancellor sets out the grim reality of the country's finances. Her economic update to the House of Commons will reveal a deteriorating economic outlook and rising borrowing costs, which has forced her to find spending cuts, which she's left others to carry the can for (more on that in a bit). Politics latest: Polling suggests almost everyone is pessimistic The independent Office of Budget Responsibility (OBR) is expected to forecast that growth for 2025 has halved from 2% to 1%. That, combined with rising debt repayment costs on government borrowing, has left the chancellor with a black hole in the public finances against the forecasts published at the budget in October. Back then, Reeves had a £9.9bn cushion against her \"iron-clad\" fiscal rule that day-to-day spending must be funded through tax receipts not debt by 2029-30. \n                  UK's fiscal position as tight as ever but expect a different focus from Rachel Reeves at the spring statement\n                 \n                  Voluntary exit schemes under way across government departments ahead of Rachel Reeves' spending cuts\n                 \n                  When is the spring statement - and what do you need to know about it?\n                 But that surplus has been wiped out in the ensuing six months - now she finds herself about £4bn in the red, according to those familiar with the forecasts. That's really uncomfortable for a chancellor who just months ago executed the biggest tax and spend budget in a generation with the promise that she would get the economy growing again. At the first progress check, she looks to be failing and has been forced into finding spending cuts to make up the shortfall after ruling out her other two options - further tax rises or more borrowing via a loosening of her self-imposed fiscal rules. Watch and follow the spring statement live across Sky News from 11am  'World has changed' When Reeves gets up on Wednesday, she will put it differently, saying the \"world has changed\" and all that means is the government must move \"further and faster\" to deliver the reforms that will drive growth. But her opponents will be quick to lay economic woes at her door, arguing that the unexpected £25bn tax hike on employers' national insurance contributions last October have choked off growth. But it's not just opposition from the Conservative benches that the chancellor is facing - it is opposition from within as she sets about cutting government spending to the tune of £15bn to fill that black hole. Politically, her allies know how awkward it would have been for the chancellor to announce £5bn in welfare cuts to avoid breaking her own fiscal rules, with one acknowledging that those cuts had to be kept separate from the spring statement. There's also expected to be more than £5bn of extra cuts from public spending in the forecast period, which could see departments that don't have protected budgets - education, justice, home - face real-term spending cuts by the end of the decade. Not an emergency budget We won't see the detail of that until the Spending Review in June. This is not an emergency budget because the chancellor isn't embarking on a round of tax raising to fix the public finances. But these are, however they are framed, emergency spending cuts designed to plug her black hole and that is politically difficult for a government that has promised no return to austerity if some parts of the public sector face deep cuts to stick with fiscal rules. If that's the macro picture, what about the \"everyday economics\" of peoples' lives? I'd point out two things here. On Wednesday, we will get to see where those £5bn of welfare cuts will fall as the government publishes the impact assessment that it held back last week. Read more:Corbyn brands benefit cuts a 'disgrace'Expect different focus from Reeves at spring statement Up to a million people could be affected by cuts, and the reality of who will be hit will pile on the pressure for Labour MPs already uncomfortable with cuts to health and disability benefits.  The second point is whether the government remains on course to deliver its key pledge to \"put more money in the pockets of working people\" during this parliament after the Joseph Rowntree Foundation think-tank produced analysis over the weekend saying living standards for all UK families are set to fall by 2030. The chancellor told my colleague Trevor Phillips on Sunday that she \"rejects\" the analysis that the average family could be £1,400 worse off by 2030. But that doesn't mean that the forecasts published on Wednesday calculating real household disposable income per head won't make for grim reading as the economic outlook deteriorates. Nervousness in Labour Ask around the party, and there is obvious nervousness about how this might land, with a degree of anxiety about the economic outlook and what that has in store for departmental budgets. But there is recognition too from many MPs that the government has political space afforded by that whopping majority, to make these decisions on spending cuts without too much fallout - for now. Because while Wednesday will be bad, worse could be yet to come. Staring down the barrel The chancellor is staring down the barrel of a possible global trade war that will only serve to create more economic uncertainty, even if the UK is spared from the worst tariffs by President Donald Trump. The national insurance hike is also set to kick in next month, with employers across the piece sounding the warnings around investment, jobs and growth. Six months ago, Reeves said she wouldn't be coming back for more after she announced £40bn in tax rises in that massive first budget. Six months on she is coming back for more, this time in the form of spending cuts. And in six months' time, she may well have to come back for more in the form of tax rises or deeper cuts. The spring statement was meant to be a run-of-the-mill economic update, but it has morphed into much more. The chancellor now has to make the hard sell from a very hard place, that could soon become even tougher still."

        "Content": "\n          Business and economics reporter\n              @SkyNewsBiz\n Tesla sales across Europe plunged 40% last month, raising further questions over the extent drivers are being put off by its chief executive Elon Musk's politics. Data covering the EU, Britain and European Free Trade Association (EFTA) nations on Tuesday showed a rise in overall new electric car sales during February, but Tesla lagging behind its peers. It sold fewer than 17,000 cars compared to over 28,000 in the same month in 2024, with a market share of 1.8% compared to the 2.8% seen 12 months ago. Money latest: What can we expect in the spring statement tomorrow? The European Automobile Manufacturers Association (ACEA) said Tesla had sold 42.6% fewer cars in Europe in the year to date. While total new car sales were down 3.1% on the same period in 2024, those for battery electric vehicles were 26.1% higher. The declines for Tesla were limited to the continent as the UK's industry body, the SMMT, had already flagged a 20% rise in Tesla sales during February compared to February 2024. \n                  DOGE staff getting daily death threats, says Elon Musk\n                 \n                  US defence staff could face lie detector tests in probe into leaks after Musk Pentagon visit\n                 \n                  Trump 100 Day 62: Why was Elon Musk at the Pentagon?\n                 The figures were released just hours after it was revealed that Chinese competitor BYD had overtaken its US rival in global annual revenue during 2024, despite the impact of European Union and US tariffs on Chinese-made EVs. Tesla's challenges include more intense, and cheaper, competition especially from China and a lack of budget models. It has also suffered from a lack of new models - with the mid-size Model Y yet to launch. But market commentators argue Mr Musk's intervention on behalf of right-wing political parties, seen most recently in the run-up to Germany's national elections in which he publicly urged Germans to vote for the AfD, have contributed significantly to the sales decline.  Tesla's sales in Germany were more than 70% lower in February - the month of the election. Mr Musk's alignment with Donald Trump in the United States, in which the Tesla boss has led efforts to shrink Federal government spending including through controversial job cuts, has prompted boycotts at home. US figures released last week showed Tesla customers trading in their cars at record levels. There have been violent protests too, with the FBI now investigating a series of attacks on Tesla interests including dealerships. Mr Musk has led funding and job-cutting measures at the newly created Department of Government Effeciency (DOGE), claiming he is seeking to stop government waste, fraud, and abuse. Critics say his aim is to destroy government departments and ultimately to consolidate his wealth and power.  Republican supporters have dubbed Musk's opponents \"Tesla terrorists\". The most recent reported attack was seen in Austin, Texas, on Monday. Local police say several \"incendiary devices\" were found and made safe on a sales forecourt. Shares in the company lost more than 50% of their market value - a hit worth around $800bn - between December and early March as investors fretted on several fronts, including over the attacks and tariffs. Another concern was that the company had lost its focus, given the expanding demands on its chief executive's time.  One of Tesla's most longstanding shareholders told Sky News last week that Mr Musk should step aside unless he quit his Trump administration interests. The president himself has attempted to help Mr Mush stop the rot by buying a Tesla car in a public show of support. Tesla shares staged a rally of almost 12% on Monday - partly aided by growing evidence that Mr Trump could exclude the auto sector from new tariffs from 2 April. Ahmad Assiri, research strategist at the brokerage Pepperstone, said of the challenges facing Tesla: \"Musk's political engagement has triggered a significant backlash, notably evident through explicit calls for boycotts, negatively impacting Tesla's reputation among substantial segments of consumers and investors, particularly given the implicit political biases. \"This situation further complicates management's position in handling this adverse environment.\" He added: \"Concurrently, China's BYD continues to gain considerable traction in the EV market, recording rapid growth and becoming increasingly attractive to consumers and investors alike. \"This intensifying competition directly threatens Tesla's market share\"."

        "Content": "\n          Business presenter\n              @iankingsky\n You can be sure of Shell, as it was put in the old advertising slogan, the veracity of which was borne out today. Ahead of its capital markets day, a long presentation to investors in New York during which it outlined its strategy for the next five years, the oil major unveiled new financial targets that had investors positively cooing. Shell plans to raise distributions to shareholders from 30-40% of \"cash flow from operations\" to between 40-50%, and will continue to prioritise share buybacks, \"while maintaining a 4% per annum progressive dividend policy\". Money latest: Rival takes fight to Aldi These are huge commitments and are important not just for Shell but for just about everyone in the UK. The old rule of thumb used to be that Shell accounted for about £1 in every £6 received in dividends by UK pension funds. While that may not necessarily be the case any more, given the disinvestment from the UK by such funds over the last decade, Shell remains a hugely important contributor to the retirement savings of Britons and, indeed, savers around the world. As interesting is how Shell intends to fund all this largesse and, in a few words, this can be summed up as doing more with less. \n                  Climate action will make British people 'more secure', says UK envoy, after Badenoch claimed it would hit living standards\n                 \n                  Fresh evidence of global warming - as politicians question climate action\n                 \n                  Kemi Badenoch says UK target to reach net zero by 2050 'impossible'\n                 The company has jacked up its cost-saving target - it was previously looking to reduce costs by between $2-3bn by the end of this year, and this has now been raised to a cumulative $5-7bn by the end of 2028. Shell is also trimming its capital expenditure (capex). The company, which last year invested $21bn and which at its last capital markets day in June 2023 set out an annual capex target of $22-25bn, said on Tuesday this would fall to $20bn-$22bn between this year and 2028. All of this is big, dial-shifting stuff. Analysts had not expected Shell's strategy to change significantly from its last capital markets day and this helps explain why the shares rose by almost 2% this morning to hit their highest level since August last year. It also confirms Wael Sawan, Shell's chief executive, to be even more hard-driving than many shareholders had been led to believe. Mr Sawan, who succeeded the long-serving Ben van Beurden at the beginning of 2023, had in his two years in charge already moved rapidly to simplify Shell's organisation. He has also moved to reshape Shell's assets and, in the process, pivot back towards hydrocarbons. Shell, like its UK-listed rival BP and in contrast to US competitors like Exxon and Chevron, had at the beginning of this decade placed a greater emphasis on investing in clean energy sources. Those strategies, however, have been punished by investors. Shell, which reported adjusted earnings of $23.72bn for 2024, has a stock market valuation of $216bn. Chevron, which reported adjusted earnings of $18.26bn for 2024, is valued at $297bn. That is a shocking gap in valuations and one that Mr Sawan is determined to narrow. It is why there has been constant speculation that Shell may follow the likes of CRH, Flutter Entertainment and Ferguson in deserting the London stock market and relocating to New York.  Mr Sawan - whose pay was revealed in today's annual report to have risen by 9% to £8.6m last year - has previously said that, if the valuation gap to Shell's US rivals had not closed by the end of this year, he will \"look at all options\" which could include such a relocation. Those concerns also help explain why Shell is de-emphasising clean energy. That does not, though, mean the company is not still mindful of such considerations. The headline on today's press release, unveiling the new targets, was \"Shell accelerates strategy to deliver more value with less emissions\". The company said today it intends to grow hydrocarbon production by 1% a year by 2030 but pledged it would do so \"with increasingly lower carbon intensity\". With oil production being maintained at 1.4 million barrels per day, that means increased production of liquified natural gas (LNG), which burns more cleanly than crude oil. That will not be enough to satisfy the company's critics. But Shell is still committed to having up to 10% of its capital employed in low carbon platforms by 2030. In the meantime, BP, which is also trying to reduce the valuation gap to its US rivals by re-emphasising hydrocarbon production, will be looking on enviously at today's response from the markets to Shell's announcement today."

He added: \"This decision will unlock economic growth across the country and finally deliver a solution to the traffic chaos faced by my constituents on a daily basis.\" Thurrock Council in Essex has consistently opposed the project over economic, social and environmental concerns, and local campaigners Thames Crossing Action Group claimed construction would cause \"eight years of disruption and gridlock on local roads\". Director of the group, Chris Todd, said: \"This is absolute madness. It's a desperate decision to distract from the likely bad news in the Chancellor's Spring Statement tomorrow.\" Read more:What you need to know about the spring statementThousands of new homes to be built across England The prime minister's spokesperson also said that the government will \"be looking at all funding options including private fiance and any final decisions on that will be taken in due course\". National Highways revealed in a Freedom of Information request last year that £295m had been spent on the application process for the LTC. Pro-growth campaign group Britain Remade noted that the cost of the planning fee alone is more than twice the amount it took Norway to build the longest road tunnel in the world. Sam Dumitriu, the thinktank's head of policy, said the Laerdal tunnel connecting Oslo and Bergen only cost £140m, adjusted for inflation."

But what is Signal - and did Donald Trump's team break the rules by using it? Read more: 'Pathetic European free-loading': What was in chat Signal is a secure messaging app that is end-to-end encrypted, meaning conversations on the platform can't be accessed by anyone except the people in the chat. Even Signal itself cannot see what is said. Although end-to-end encryption is now fairly common, with WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger and Telegram all offering it, Signal was ahead of its time and began offering secure messaging in 2013. The encryption technology it uses, called the Signal Protocol, is now considered the industry standard. It aims to \"end-to-end encrypt everything that we possibly can and to store as little [user data] as possible\", according to Signal Foundation president Meredith Whittaker and developer Joshua Lund. The non-profit's ethos of customer privacy has made it a go-to messaging platform for secure conversations.  Signal is also open-source, which means its users can check that the platform is actually doing what it says it is doing. It is also unable to hand over information to law enforcement authorities, which some other encrypted messaging platforms do, because it can't break its own encryption. \"Signal protects all of this with strong encryption so even if Signal is threatened or coerced, Signal can't hand over that kind of data,\" Ms Whittaker said recently. That became a sensitive topic for the Home Office in February after it was reported the UK government tried to force Apple to create a backdoor to its end-to-end encryption. However, despite its focus on data privacy, Signal is still a commercial app and is not classified by US officials. According to US media, some officials were allowed to download Signal on their White House-issued phones under Joe Biden's administration but were told never to share classified information on it. Messaging apps \"are NOT authorised to access, transmit, process non-public DoD information\", Pentagon rules state.  When Trump officials accidentally included the editor of The Atlantic in a group chat where they discussed conducting airstrikes on Yemen's Iran-backed Houthis, it was not immediately clear if information on the military operation was classified. However, information like this often is and would usually be kept secure to protect service members and operational security. Brian Hughes, spokesman for the National Security Council, confirmed the veracity of the Signal group. \"This appears to be an authentic message chain, and we are reviewing how an inadvertent number was added to the chain,\" he said."

        "Content": "\n          Political reporter\n              @fayebrownSky\n  Rachel Reeves will unveil further welfare cuts in her spring statement after being told the reforms announced last week will save less than planned, Sky News understands. The Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) has rejected the government's assessment that the package of measures, including narrowing the eligibility criteria for personal independence payments (PIP), will save £5bn. Politics latest: Ex-Labour leader says Starmer 'an enormous disappointment' The fiscal watchdog put the value of the cuts at £3.4bn, leaving ministers scrambling to find further savings. Ms Reeves is now expected to announce that universal credit (UC) incapacity benefits for new claimants, which were halved under the original plan, will also be frozen until 2030 rather than rising in line with inflation As originally reported by The Times, there will also be a small reduction in the basic rate of UC in 2029, with the new measures expected to raise £500m. A Whitehall source told Sky's political editor Beth Rigby that it is \"hard to tell how MPs will react\", as while the OBR's assessment means fewer people will be affected by the PIP changes than thought, they \"might be unhappy about the chaotic nature of it all\". The government did not publish an impact assessment of the crackdown on benefits it announced last week, saying that would come alongside the spring statement on Wednesday. Several Labour MPs criticised the measures as pushing more sick and disabled people into poverty, while former Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn called the package a \"disgrace\" on Tuesday and accused the government of imposing austerity on the country. Watch and follow the spring statement live across Sky News from 11am  Spending cuts expected Ms Reeves is expected to announce a large package of departmental spending cuts when she gives an update on the economy on Wednesday, potentially putting her on a further collision course with her own MPs. Having only committed to doing one proper budget each year in the autumn, the spring statement was meant to be a low-key affair. However, a turbulent economic climate since October means the OBR is widely expected to downgrade its growth forecasts for the UK while the government has borrowed more than previously expected. This has wiped out the £9.9bn gap in her fiscal headroom Ms Reeves left herself at her budget last year - money she needs to make up if she wants to stick to her self-imposed fiscal rule that day-to-day spending must be funded through tax receipts, not debt, by 2029-30. The chancellor has sought to blame global factors but the Conservatives blame measures like the national insurance tax hike on employers, saying this is choking business. Shadow chancellor Mel Stride urged Ms Reeves to \"use the emergency budget\" to \"fix her own mistakes and end Labour's war on enterprise\". Ms Reeves will defend her record in the spring statement, saying she is \"proud\" of what Labour has achieved in its first nine months in office. However, on the eve of the statement, polling showed the public is pessimistic about what is to come. According to More in Common, half think the cost of living crisis will never end, while YouGov found three-quarters of people want to see a tax on the richest over spending cuts. Ms Reeves is not expected to announce any tax hikes, having said her tax-raising budget in October was a once-in-a-parliament event. Read more:Chancellor can make decisions now without too much falloutExpect different focus from Reeves at spring statement Defence increase to 'deliver security' In a bid to fend off criticism, she will also announce an extra £2.2bn will be spent on defence over the next year to \"deliver security for working people\". The money is part of the government's aim to hike defence spending to 2.5% of the UK's economic output by 2027 - up from the 2.3% where it stands now. Ms Reeves will insist this plan, set out by the prime minister in February, was the \"right decision\" against the backdrop of global instability, saying it will put \"an extra 6.4bn into the defence budget by 2027\". \"This increase in investment is not just about increasing our national security but increasing our economic security, too,\" she will say. The money is coming from reductions to the international aid budget and Treasury reserves, and will be used to invest in new technology, refurbish homes for military families and upgrade HM Naval Base Portsmouth."

But the enormity of what she is saying will be lost on no one as the chancellor sets out the grim reality of the country's finances. Her economic update to the House of Commons will reveal a deteriorating economic outlook and rising borrowing costs, which has forced her to find spending cuts, which she's left others to carry the can for (more on that in a bit). Politics latest: Polling suggests almost everyone is pessimistic The independent Office of Budget Responsibility (OBR) is expected to forecast that growth for 2025 has halved from 2% to 1%. That, combined with rising debt repayment costs on government borrowing, has left the chancellor with a black hole in the public finances against the forecasts published at the budget in October. Back then, Reeves had a £9.9bn cushion against her \"iron-clad\" fiscal rule that day-to-day spending must be funded through tax receipts not debt by 2029-30. \n                  UK's fiscal position as tight as ever but expect a different focus from Rachel Reeves at the spring statement\n                 \n                  Voluntary exit schemes under way across government departments ahead of Rachel Reeves' spending cuts\n                 \n                  When is the spring statement - and what do you need to know about it?\n                 But that surplus has been wiped out in the ensuing six months - now she finds herself about £4bn in the red, according to those familiar with the forecasts. That's really uncomfortable for a chancellor who just months ago executed the biggest tax and spend budget in a generation with the promise that she would get the economy growing again. At the first progress check, she looks to be failing and has been forced into finding spending cuts to make up the shortfall after ruling out her other two options - further tax rises or more borrowing via a loosening of her self-imposed fiscal rules. Watch and follow the spring statement live across Sky News from 11am  'World has changed' When Reeves gets up on Wednesday, she will put it differently, saying the \"world has changed\" and all that means is the government must move \"further and faster\" to deliver the reforms that will drive growth. But her opponents will be quick to lay economic woes at her door, arguing that the unexpected £25bn tax hike on employers' national insurance contributions last October have choked off growth. But it's not just opposition from the Conservative benches that the chancellor is facing - it is opposition from within as she sets about cutting government spending to the tune of £15bn to fill that black hole. Politically, her allies know how awkward it would have been for the chancellor to announce £5bn in welfare cuts to avoid breaking her own fiscal rules, with one acknowledging that those cuts had to be kept separate from the spring statement. There's also expected to be more than £5bn of extra cuts from public spending in the forecast period, which could see departments that don't have protected budgets - education, justice, home - face real-term spending cuts by the end of the decade. Not an emergency budget We won't see the detail of that until the Spending Review in June. This is not an emergency budget because the chancellor isn't embarking on a round of tax raising to fix the public finances. But these are, however they are framed, emergency spending cuts designed to plug her black hole and that is politically difficult for a government that has promised no return to austerity if some parts of the public sector face deep cuts to stick with fiscal rules. If that's the macro picture, what about the \"everyday economics\" of peoples' lives? I'd point out two things here. On Wednesday, we will get to see where those £5bn of welfare cuts will fall as the government publishes the impact assessment that it held back last week. Read more:Corbyn brands benefit cuts a 'disgrace'Expect different focus from Reeves at spring statement Up to a million people could be affected by cuts, and the reality of who will be hit will pile on the pressure for Labour MPs already uncomfortable with cuts to health and disability benefits.  The second point is whether the government remains on course to deliver its key pledge to \"put more money in the pockets of working people\" during this parliament after the Joseph Rowntree Foundation think-tank produced analysis over the weekend saying living standards for all UK families are set to fall by 2030. The chancellor told my colleague Trevor Phillips on Sunday that she \"rejects\" the analysis that the average family could be £1,400 worse off by 2030. But that doesn't mean that the forecasts published on Wednesday calculating real household disposable income per head won't make for grim reading as the economic outlook deteriorates. Nervousness in Labour Ask around the party, and there is obvious nervousness about how this might land, with a degree of anxiety about the economic outlook and what that has in store for departmental budgets. But there is recognition too from many MPs that the government has political space afforded by that whopping majority, to make these decisions on spending cuts without too much fallout - for now. Because while Wednesday will be bad, worse could be yet to come. Staring down the barrel The chancellor is staring down the barrel of a possible global trade war that will only serve to create more economic uncertainty, even if the UK is spared from the worst tariffs by President Donald Trump. The national insurance hike is also set to kick in next month, with employers across the piece sounding the warnings around investment, jobs and growth. Six months ago, Reeves said she wouldn't be coming back for more after she announced £40bn in tax rises in that massive first budget. Six months on she is coming back for more, this time in the form of spending cuts. And in six months' time, she may well have to come back for more in the form of tax rises or deeper cuts. The spring statement was meant to be a run-of-the-mill economic update, but it has morphed into much more. The chancellor now has to make the hard sell from a very hard place, that could soon become even tougher still."

        "Content": "\n          Economics and data editor\n              @EdConwaySky\n  Remember \"securonomics\"? It was the buzzword Rachel Reeves gave to her economic philosophy back before the election. The idea was that in the late 2020s, the old ideas about the way we run the economy would or should give way to a new model. For a long time, we ignored where something was made and by whom and just ordered it in from the cheapest source. For a long time, we ignored the security consequences of where we got our energy from. The upshot of these assumptions was that over time, we allowed our manufacturing base to become hollowed out, unable to compete with cheap imports from China. We allowed our energy system to become ever more dependent on cheap Russian gas. Money blog: Supermarket puts buying limit on new Lindt version of viral chocolate The whole point of securonomics was that it matters where something is made and who owns it. And not just that - that revitalising manufacturing and energy could help revitalise \"left-behind\" corners of the economy, places like the Midlands and the North East. Back when she came up with the coinage, Joe Biden was in power and was pumping billions of dollars into the US economy via the Inflation Reduction Act - a scheme designed to encourage green tech investment. So securonomics looked a little like the British version of Bidenomics. That's the key point: the \"security\" part of \"securonomics\" was mostly about energy security and supply chain security rather than about defence. Watch and follow the spring statement live across Sky News from 11am But when Rachel Reeves became chancellor, it looked for a period as if securonomics was dead on arrival. Most glaringly, Labour dramatically trimmed back the ambition and scale of its green investment plans. But roll on a year or so, and we all know what happened next. A new era The Democrats lost, Donald Trump won, came into office and swiftly triggered a chain reaction that panicked everyone in Europe into investing more in defence. Today, much of the focus among investors is not on net zero but on defence. All of which is to say, securonomics might be about to resurface, but in a markedly different guise. In the spring statement, I expect the chancellor to bring back this buzzword, but this time, the emphasis will not be on green tech but on something else: the defence sector. Expect to hear about weapons This time around, the chancellor will say securonomics 2.0, which is to say government investment in the defence sector will also bring an economic windfall, as old naval ports like Plymouth and Portsmouth see regeneration. This time, the focus will not be on solar and wind but on submarines and weapons. Whether this rendition of securonomics is any more successful than the last remains to be seen. For the chancellor hardly has an enormous amount of money left to invest. While this week's event is billed as a mere forecast update, the reality, when you take a step back, is more serious. Read more:What do you need to know about the spring statement The chancellor will have to acknowledge that, without remedial action, she would have broken her fiscal rules. She will have to confirm significant changes to policy to rebuild the \"headroom\" against these rules. These will stop short of tax rises. Instead, the spending envelope in future years will be trimmed (think 1.1% or so spending increases rather than 1.3% or 1.4%). Those welfare reforms announced last week will bring in a bit of extra cash. And thanks to an accounting quirk, the decision (announced a few weeks ago) to shift development spending into defence will also give her a bit more space against her rules. The austerity question But even these changes will raise further awkward questions: is this or is this not austerity? Certainly, for some departments, that spending cut will involve further significant sacrifices. Are those benefits gains really achievable, and at what cost? And, most ominously, what if the chancellor has to come back to parliament in another six months and admit she's broken her rules all over again? The return of securonomics might be the theme she wants to focus on in the coming months - but that, too, depends on having money to invest - and the UK's fiscal position looks as tight as ever."

        "Content": "\n          Arts and entertainment reporter\n              @BethanyMinelle\n Laurence Fox has been charged with a sexual offence, the Metropolitan Police have confirmed. The charge, which has been brought under section 66A of the Sexual Offences Act 2003, relates to an image that was posted on social media in April last year. The act makes it illegal to intentionally share sexual images of someone without their consent, with the aim of causing alarm, distress, or humiliation, or for sexual gratification. Presenter Narinder Kaur - who has waived her right to anonymity - alleges the image shows her as she got out of a taxi in 1996, and was taken without her knowledge and consent. Kaur, 52, reported the image when it was shared online, triggering an 11-month investigation by the Metropolitan Police. She has previously said she felt \"violated, humiliated and degraded\" by the incident. Fox, 46, who has recently attempted to enter the world of politics, will appear at Westminster Magistrates' Court on 24 April, where he is expected to enter a plea. If convicted, he faces up to two years in prison and could be placed on the Sex Offenders Register. The Metropolitan Police told Sky News in a statement: \"A man has been charged with a sexual offence following an investigation by the Metropolitan Police. \"Laurence Fox, 46, will appear at Westminster Magistrates' Court on 24 April charged with an offence contrary to section 66A of the Sexual Offences Act 2003. \"The charge relates to an image that was posted on social media platform in April 2024.\""

        "Content": "\n          Political reporter\n              @fayebrownSky\n  Jeremy Corbyn has said Sir Keir Starmer's benefit cuts are a \"disgrace\" and demanded the government \"think again\". Speaking to Sky News' Politics Hub with Sophy Ridge, the former Labour leader accused the prime minister of imposing austerity on the country and warned many of his ex-colleagues are \"very upset\". Politics Live: Chancellor sent clear message in new poll - as Farage brands protester 'a saddo' It comes ahead of Chancellor Rachel Reeves's spring statement on Wednesday, when she is expected to announce further spending cuts after slashing the welfare budget by £5bn last week.  Mr Corbyn said he would like to see Ms Reeves \"think again\" about the cut to personal independence payments (PIP), warning it will push more people into poverty and force others to give up jobs so they can look after them - \"usually women and families\". The now independent MP called for a wealth tax on society's richest to raise money - something three quarters of the British public would support, according to a new YouGov poll.  He called the Labour Party in government an \"enormous disappointment\", adding: \"I never thought I'd hear the day when a chancellor would get up and say they're taking five billion pounds out of the income of the very poorest disabled people in our society. It is a disgrace.\" \n                  Chancellor Rachel Reeves expected to announce further welfare cuts in spring statement\n                 \n                  Spring statement: Rachel Reeves can make decisions on spending cuts without too much fallout for now - but worse could be yet to come\n                 \n                  UK's fiscal position as tight as ever but expect a different focus from Rachel Reeves at the spring statement\n                 The government has argued that welfare reforms are necessary because of the unsustainable cost of long-term sickness and disability benefits, with other measures announced to get more people back into work. However, Ms Reeves has faced criticism as she is looking to make up about £10bn in lost fiscal headroom to balance the books, following global instability and poor economic growth since her October budget. She is expected to announce the biggest departmental spending cuts to Whitehall in years in the spring statement, arguing this is necessary for efficiency. The government has repeatedly denied that it is returning to austerity. Other recent \"efficiency savings\" it has announced include abolishing NHS England and axing 10,000 jobs in the civil service.  'Return to austerity' But Mr Corbyn said while \"the word austerity will not be passing lips of any ministers tomorrow\" that is the reality of the situation. He said: \"If you're saying you're going to take figures - I've heard 7%, I've heard other figures - out of the department's budget, what does that mean? \"You can't do all that by efficiency. That means jobs being lost, or it means services being cut, or it means both.\" Asked if he called that austerity, he said: \"Yes, I do, because it is basically a role of austerity in reducing the levels of public expenditure at the expense of the poorest within our society.\" 'Labour MPs upset' Mr Corbyn said Labour MPs who \"initially weren't keen\" on talking to him after his election to parliament as an independent MP are now telling him they are \"very upset\" - and urged them to speak out rather than \"pass the buck\". It was put to him that his time as Labour leader resulted in the party's worst election defeat in decades, and ministers may say if he is unhappy then they are doing something right. But Mr Corbyn said if Sir Keir \"cared to look again at the manifesto on which he stood\" in 2019 there was a \"clear plan\" to address homelessness, rent levels and poverty in society. He said the prime minister seems to have \"distanced himself\" from those policies nowadays, but would not be drawn on whether he thought he was a chameleon. Mr Corbyn said: \"There's a lot of chameleons in parliament. It is about how a government should approach the society we're living in. \"If you're content with the levels of poverty... that's your view. I'm not. I don't believe most Labour MPs are happy with that. So they should recognize that this is their opportunity to do something fundamental. It seems to me they're trying to pass the buck.\" You can watch the interview in full on the Politics Hub with Sophy Ridge at 7pm."

        "Content": "\n          Political reporter\n              @alexrogerssky\n JD Vance is less liked among the UK public than Donald Trump, Sir Keir Starmer or any other major UK politician, a new poll shared with Sky News has found. Just 14% of the British public have a favourable view of the US vice president, compared with 21% for Mr Trump and 29% for the prime minister and Reform UK leader Nigel Farage. Ipsos questioned 1,132 adults aged 18 and over across Great Britain online between the 14 and 17 March - just weeks after the heated exchange between Mr Vance, Mr Trump and Volodymyr Zelenskyy in the White House over military assistance to Ukraine. Politics latest: Farage brands protester 'a saddo' The poll was carried out before a conversation on the messaging app Signal - between US officials, including the vice president - was accidentally leaked to an American journalist, who was added to the encrypted chat in error. In the conversation, Mr Vance and other officials - including National Security Adviser Michael Waltz, Secretary of State Marco Rubio and US Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth - discussed plans to conduct airstrikes on Yemen's Iran-backed Houthis, which took place on 15 March. During the discussion, Mr Vance questioned the rationale behind the military action, arguing that attacking the Houthis would largely serve European interests, with the continent benefiting from US protection of shipping lanes in the Red Sea that are a frequent target for attacks \n                  Chancellor Rachel Reeves expected to announce further welfare cuts in spring statement\n                 \n                  Spring statement: Rachel Reeves can make decisions on spending cuts without too much fallout for now - but worse could be yet to come\n                 \n                  UK's fiscal position as tight as ever but expect a different focus from Rachel Reeves at the spring statement\n                 US security breach latest: Trump dismisses war plan 'glitch' In a message addressed to Mr Hegseth, Mr Vance said: \"If you think we should do it let's go. I just hate bailing Europe out again.\" Mr Hegseth, who had made the case for military action against the Houthis, replied: \"I fully share your loathing of European free-loading. PATHETIC.\"  Keiran Pedley, Ipsos director of politics, told Sky News: \"It is clear from these numbers that Vance is unpopular with the British public. \"A majority hold an unfavourable view of the vice president, including clear majorities of Conservative, Labour and Lib Dem voters. Reform UK supporters are more split, with slightly more holding an unfavourable view than a favourable one.\" The leak of the messages to Jeffrey Goldberg, The Atlantic's editor in chief, has raised concerns about US national security and the Trump's administration's attitude towards Europe as it seeks to reach a peace deal between Russia and Ukraine to end the war.  President Trump has dismissed the significance of the accidental leaking of US military intelligence to Mr Goldberg, telling Garrett Haake, a reporter from Sky News' US partner network NBC, that the journalist was \"a sleazeball\" and that his presence on the Signal chain had \"no impact at all\". Asked how he came to be added to the chat, Mr Trump said it was one of Mr Waltz's staffers who \"had his number on there\". Asked if he still had confidence in Waltz, Trump said he did: \"Michael Waltz has learned a lesson, and he's a good man.\" Read more:Trump officials discussing war plans lambasted as 'amateur hour'DOGE staff getting daily death threats, says Elon Musk The US president also expressed confidence in his team and supported comments by his defence secretary that the story was a non-issue, arguing it was \"the only glitch in two months, and it turned out not to be a serious one\". Downing Street has also insisted it is confident any UK intelligence shared with the US was being handled appropriately. The prime minister's official spokesman said: \"The US is our closest ally when it comes to matters of defence, we have a long-standing relationship on intelligence and defence cooperation. \"We will continue to build on the very strong relationship we already have with the US on defence and security matters.\""

        "Content": "Thousands of new homes in England will be built as part of a £2bn plan to boost social and affordable house building, the government has said. Up to 18,000 new homes are set to be delivered, which Chancellor Rachel Reeves said would go some way to \"fixing the housing crisis\". Charities said the \"vast majority\" of new homes should be for social rent amid record highs in homelessness across the country. The funding is described by the government as a \"down payment from the Treasury\" ahead of longer-term investment in social and affordable housing expected to be announced later in the year. The government expects at least half of the 18,000 would be social homes. But charities have called for the \"vast majority\" to be for social rent as homelessness hits record highs across the country. Follow politics latest here The government has pledged to build 1.5 million new homes over the next five years. Tuesday's announcement comes a day before the spring statement, in which the chancellor is expected to announce spending cuts for some government departments, having already unveiled cuts to welfare. The cuts - which have proved unpopular with Labour backbenchers - come amid reports that the digital services tax - a levy on big tech companies - could be slashed in order to stave off American tariffs. Last year, experts at the New Economics Foundation said 90,000 social homes would need to be built by as early as 2027/28 to meet the government's target. By the final year of this parliament, ministers would \"need to go beyond this and deliver 110,000 new social homes to ensure 1.5 million homes are built\", the foundation said, amounting to a total of 365,000 social rent homes over the next five years to hit the target. Read more:What do you need to know about spring statement  The chancellor announced the plans on a visit to an affordable housing site in Stoke-On-Trent with deputy prime minister Angela Rayner. Ms Rayner said: \"Everyone deserves to have a safe and secure roof over their heads and a place to call their own, but the reality is that far too many people have been frozen out of homeownership or denied the chance to rent a home they can afford thanks to the housing crisis we've inherited. \"This investment will help us to build thousands more affordable homes to buy and rent and get working people and families into secure homes and onto the housing ladder.\" The number of households on local authority waiting lists, or registers, for social housing in England stood at 1,330,611 in 2024 - the highest figure in a decade. The previous highest figure was 1,370,410 in 2014. Matt Downie, chief executive of housing and homelessness charity Crisis, said Tuesday's announcement was \"hugely welcome\" and hopefully \"signals the beginning of a social housebuilding programme that will radically shift this country's response to homelessness, putting housing at the heart of the solution\"."

        "Content": "\n          Political reporter\n              @alexrogerssky\n A swathe of government departments have either begun or will start voluntary exit schemes for staff in anticipation of the chancellor's spending cuts, Sky News can reveal. Multiple departments, including the Department for Environment and Rural Affairs, the Foreign Office and Cabinet Office have all kickstarted the plans in line with the government's ambition to reduce bureaucracy and make the state more efficient. Others, including the Department for Health and Social Care and the Ministry of Housing and Local Government, have yet to start schemes but it is expected they will, with the former already set to lose staff following the shock abolition of NHS England that was announced earlier this month. Politics latest: Public want chancellor to tax the richest  It comes as Rachel Reeves prepares to deliver her spring statement on Wednesday, when she is expected to announce plans to cut civil service running costs by 15% along with further savings. The move, confirmed by the chancellor on Sunday, could result in 10,000 civil service jobs being axed after numbers ballooned during the pandemic. Ms Reeves hopes the cuts, which she said will be to \"back office jobs\" rather than frontline services, will slash more than £2bn from the budget. \n                  Sir Keir Starmer reveals he's been in touch with ex-England boss about issues raised in Netflix drama\n                 \n                  Nigel Farage would turn UK into a 'Trump tribute act', Lib Dem leader Sir Ed Davey says\n                 \n                  Celebrities urge government to reverse 'shameful' welfare cuts\n                 Under the plans, civil service departments will first have to reduce administrative budgets by 10%, which is expected to save £1.5bn a year by 2028-29. The following year, the reduction should be 15% - a saving of £2.2bn a year. The FDA union, which represents civil servants, has said the government needs to be honest about the move and the \"impact it will have on public services\". FDA General Secretary Dave Penman said: \"The idea that cuts of this scale can be delivered by cutting HR and comms teams is for the birds. \"This plan will require ministers to be honest with the public and their civil servants about the impact this will have on public services.\" Voluntary exit schemes differ from voluntary redundancy schemes in that they offer departments more flexibility around the terms offered to departing staff. A Cabinet Office spokesperson told Sky News: \"We are reorganising the Cabinet Office so that it becomes more strategic, specialist and smaller.  \"This includes implementing a new top-level departmental structure from April 2025 so that the department is effectively set up to support the government and the prime minister's critical priorities under the plan for change.\" The spokesman added that the voluntary exit scheme, which was launched earlier this year, will reduce the Cabinet Office's headcount by about 400 roles but that it was not setting a specific target. They said each application to the scheme would be examined on a case by case basis to ensure \"we retain critical skills and experience\". \"Creating more productive and agile state will refocus efforts to deliver security and renewal by kick-starting economic growth to put more money in working people's pockets, rebuilding the NHS and strengthening our borders,\" they said. \"That is why we have set a target of reducing departmental administration costs by 15% over the next five years, which will save over £2bn a year by 2030. Read more:What do you need to know about the spring statementHome Office cancels hotel company's contract to house asylum seekers \"Savings from the 15% target will ensure that departments are prioritising frontline delivery, and focusing resources into the services that matter to the public.  \"We are also supporting civil servants to be more productive and specialist, with a target for 10% of civil servants to be in specialist digital and data roles by the end of the decade.\" Sky News understands that the voluntary exit scheme opened by Defra is one strategy the department is using to create a more affordable and agile workforce. It has already carried out a resource realignment exercise and is using natural attrition to reduce headcount. Meanwhile, the Foreign Office's voluntary exit scheme was launched on 14 November last year. A source said the scheme was started to respond to the challenging fiscal environment and was a key strategic tool in targeting resource where it was most needed to promote British interests overseas. The cuts form part of a wider government agenda to streamline the civil service and the size of the British state, which Sir Keir Starmer criticised as \"weaker than it has ever been\". Each of the departments named in this article has been approached for comment."

We don't comment on how allies share their information. \"I'm confident that we have robust measures to safeguard our information and our data, but we also have a very clear set of systems where individuals don't follow procedures, with sufficient consequences to reflect the actions that have been taken.\" The minister added that there would be \"a clear consequence and disciplinary process for anyone that was not following those procedures\". 👉 Follow Trump 100 on your podcast app 👈 No10 still confident in US-UK intelligence relationship A Downing Street spokesman, meanwhile, told journalists: \"The US is our closest ally when it comes to matters of defence, we have a long-standing relationship on intelligence and defence cooperation. \"We will continue to build on the very strong relationship we already have with the US on defence and security matters.\" Asked whether the government was happy UK personnel had been involved in an operation where details had been shared with a journalist, the spokesman said he would not comment on intelligence matters.  'Trump's White House can't be trusted' The leader of the Liberal Democrats disagrees completely with the government, and is calling for a comprehensive review of the UK's intelligence sharing arrangements with the US. Sir Ed Davey said: \"Trump's White House can't be trusted to take even the most basic steps to keep its own intelligence safe. \"Their fly-by-the-seat-of-your-pants approach to security means it could only be a matter of time until our own intelligence shared with them is also leaked. This could put British lives at risk.\"  Sir Ed is not alone in his concerns, with four former US ambassadors having expressed their concerns about intelligence sharing with the US under the Trump administration. Sir David Manning, ambassador between 2003 and 2007, told a parliamentary committee that some of Mr Trump's appointees had \"strange track records\" that would create a \"problem on the intelligence front\". Dame Karen Pierce, who served through some of the first Trump presidency and left Washington last month, said intelligence sharing would continue \"even if at the top level there might be things we might wish to be circumspect about\".

On 15 March, US airstrikes killed at least 53 people in Yemen in retaliation for Houthi threats to begin targeting \"Israeli\" ships after Israel blocked aid entering the Gaza Strip. The daily bombardment has continued for the 10 days since then. UK forces assisted the US navy with refuelling of military jets during the airstrikes earlier this month. The UK and US intelligence networks are deeply integrated, and both countries are part of the Five Eyes intelligence sharing alliance, which also includes Australia, Canada, and New Zealand."

        "Content": "\n          Science and Technology reporter\n        The security of messaging app Signal was compromised by human error when top US officials accidentally added a journalist to their group chat. But what is Signal - and did Donald Trump's team break the rules by using it? Read more: 'Pathetic European free-loading': What was in chat Signal is a secure messaging app that is end-to-end encrypted, meaning conversations on the platform can't be accessed by anyone except the people in the chat. Even Signal itself cannot see what is said. Although end-to-end encryption is now fairly common, with WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger and Telegram all offering it, Signal was ahead of its time and began offering secure messaging in 2013. The encryption technology it uses, called the Signal Protocol, is now considered the industry standard. It aims to \"end-to-end encrypt everything that we possibly can and to store as little [user data] as possible\", according to Signal Foundation president Meredith Whittaker and developer Joshua Lund. The non-profit's ethos of customer privacy has made it a go-to messaging platform for secure conversations.  Signal is also open-source, which means its users can check that the platform is actually doing what it says it is doing. It is also unable to hand over information to law enforcement authorities, which some other encrypted messaging platforms do, because it can't break its own encryption. \"Signal protects all of this with strong encryption so even if Signal is threatened or coerced, Signal can't hand over that kind of data,\" Ms Whittaker said recently. That became a sensitive topic for the Home Office in February after it was reported the UK government tried to force Apple to create a backdoor to its end-to-end encryption. However, despite its focus on data privacy, Signal is still a commercial app and is not classified by US officials. According to US media, some officials were allowed to download Signal on their White House-issued phones under Joe Biden's administration but were told never to share classified information on it. Messaging apps \"are NOT authorised to access, transmit, process non-public DoD information\", Pentagon rules state.  When Trump officials accidentally included the editor of The Atlantic in a group chat where they discussed conducting airstrikes on Yemen's Iran-backed Houthis, it was not immediately clear if information on the military operation was classified. However, information like this often is and would usually be kept secure to protect service members and operational security. Brian Hughes, spokesman for the National Security Council, confirmed the veracity of the Signal group. \"This appears to be an authentic message chain, and we are reviewing how an inadvertent number was added to the chain,\" he said."

        "Content": "The H5N1 strain of bird flu has the \"potential to become a pandemic\", according to an expert at the UK Health Security Agency. Richard Pebody, director of epidemic and emerging infections at UKHSA, explained that while the virus is \"not new\", and the risk to the public remains low, its features have changed in recent years. It follows a confirmed case of bird flu in a single sheep in England for the first time on Monday. At the agency's annual conference in Manchester on Tuesday, Mr Pebody described that news as \"a new twist to the story\" but stressed the risk \"hasn't necessarily changed\". \"H5N1 has the potential to become a pandemic, a future pandemic. And so that's why we're watching that so closely and managing it so closely. \"We know that the virus can infect other animal species. We need to clearly look into this a little bit more, understand better what's happened here and understand what the risk is to human health,\" he said.

At the time, Dr Meera Chand, emerging infection lead at the UKHSA, said that \"current evidence suggests that the avian influenza viruses we're seeing circulating around the world do not spread easily to people\" and \"the risk of avian flu to the general public remains very low\". The virus was also detected in dairy cattle in a number of US states last spring and Sky News revealed in December that horses can harbour the virus too. Human case in West Midlands Mr Pebody said: \"H5N1 is not new. It's been around for quite a long while. It first popped up in the back in the 1990s, mid-1990s, but it's waxed and waned over the years. Over the past three or four years, its features have changed\". Bird flu in people is rare, although in January, a person in the West Midlands region tested positive after being infected while on a farm after \"close and prolonged contact\" with infected birds. What are the symptoms? Symptoms can vary depending on the strain but can include a flu-like illness with fever, body aches, cough, sore throat, sore eyes and runny nose. Read more from Sky News:What you should know about bird fluRecovery from bird flu 'painfully slow'Bird flu infects horses without symptoms On Tuesday, the UKHSA published its first annual report detailing the infectious diseases impacting England, which included influenza A (H5N1) as an \"emerging infection\", along with mpox and swine influenza. It said its bird flu surveillance programmes, which involve taking samples from people exposed to infected birds, detected a \"small number\" of workers who were asymptomatic [infected but not showing symptoms], with \"one clinical infection in January 2025\". \"There has yet to be demonstrated human-to-human transmission of avian flu despite extensive recent surveillance,\" the report added. A list of \"priority pathogens\" published by UKHSA also includes the viral family orthomyxoviridae, which influenza A viruses belong to. In December, the government agreed a deal to buy more than five million doses of a vaccine for a strain of bird flu to bolster pandemic preparedness. Mr Pebody said: \"We do need to be prepared for the next emerging infection and indeed, the next pandemic. So that's very much the core business of the agency.!"

The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) has urged the online platform to change the way it labels its tickets and provide better pricing information to fans. The CMA has been investigating the site following widespread complaints about the sale of Oasis gig tickets last year, which saw over 900,000 tickets purchased through the site. Liam and Noel Gallagher announced the band would reunite for a tour in 2025, but fans suffered various problems when trying to get tickets, including some ending up paying as much as £355 for tickets originally advertised for £148 on Ticketmaster. The controversy prompted the CMA to look at how 'dynamic pricing' - a form of surge pricing - may have been used, and whether the sale by Ticketmaster may have breached consumer protection law. While the investigation is still ongoing, the CMA said it is \"concerned\" Ticketmaster may have breached consumer protection law.

It also found Ticketmaster did not inform fans that there were two categories of standing tickets at different prices, and there was no evidence that it used dynamic pricing. \"Many fans were under the impression that Ticketmaster used an algorithmic pricing model during the Oasis sale, with ticket prices adjusted in real time according to changing conditions like high demand,\" the watchdog said. \"The CMA has not found evidence that this was the case. Instead, Ticketmaster released a number of standing tickets at a lower price and, once they had sold out, then released the remaining standing tickets at a much higher price.\" Downing Street has said \"everyone deserves a fair shot at getting tickets\" for music and sport events. Asked what message the prime minister had for fans affected by the Oasis sale, a Number 10 spokesman said: \"In general terms, the chance to see your favourite musicians or sports teams live is something that all of us enjoy, and everyone deserves a fair shot at getting tickets. \"But for too long, fans have had to endure the misery of touts hoovering up tickets for resale at vastly inflated prices. We've also seen cases where a lack of transparency has meant customers have been caught unawares by last minute price rises for high demand events.\" The spokesman said there would be a full response to a consultation issued in due course. At the time of the backlash, a spokesperson for Ticketmaster said: \"Fans can resell their Oasis tickets at the full price they paid through Ticketmaster or Twickets.\" The gigs kick off this July in Cardiff, running until September when the band will perform two final Wembley Stadium shows."

Stargazers from as far north as Denmark and as far south as Milan in Italy noted the cloud-like spiral was visible for several minutes before fading. The Met Office explained in a post on X that the phenomenon was likely caused by frozen exhaust smoke from Elon Musk's SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket. \"The rocket's frozen exhaust plume appears to be spinning in the atmosphere and reflecting the sunlight, causing it to appear as a spiral in the sky,\" the Met Office said. These spirals form when ejected rocket fuel from the fast-spinning upper stages of the Falcon 9 gets frozen in space instantly because of the altitude. The frozen swirls then reflect sunlight back towards Earth, which makes them visible in the night sky.

Meanwhile, Keeley Williams said the swirl \"started off hazy, then became really bright before looking like it was spinning\".

The act makes it illegal to intentionally share sexual images of someone without their consent, with the aim of causing alarm, distress, or humiliation, or for sexual gratification.

I don't have to talk like that, get angry like that, voila.\" He also claimed that he had been in a \"bad mood\" because the set was hot, which was difficult for him, being overweight.

        "Content": "A \"once-in-a-lifetime\" hoard of Iron Age artefacts has been uncovered by archaeologists. Dubbed the Melsonby hoard, more than 800 items were discovered by metal detectorist Peter Heads in 2021 in two ditches near the North Yorkshire village of the same name. After Mr Heads reported the location to the proper authorities, the head of archaeology at Durham University professor Tom Moore was called to the site. He said it was quickly clear that the find was a \"once-in-a-lifetime discovery\". 'Exceptional for Britain' The expert said: \"The Melsonby hoard is of a scale and size that is exceptional for Britain and probably even Europe. \"Unusually it includes lots of pieces of vehicles and items such as the wine mixing bowl which is decorated in both Mediterranean and Iron Age styles. \"Whoever originally owned the material in this hoard was probably a part of a network of elites across Britain, into Europe and even the Roman world.\" Among the 2,000-year-old artefacts are the partial remains of wagons, ceremonial spears and pony harnesses. Iron tyres were also found to have been intentionally bent out of shape, and a large amount of the material had been ritualistically burnt or broken. Prof Moore added: \"The destruction of so many high-status objects, evident in this hoard, is also of a scale rarely seen in Iron Age Britain and demonstrates that the elites of northern Britain were just as powerful as their southern counterparts.\" 'Connections to continental Europe' Elaborate harnesses for at least 14 ponies, three ceremonial spears and two ornate cauldrons or vessels - one lidded and likely used as a wine mixing bowl - were also found. Some of the harness pieces were adorned with Mediterranean coral and coloured glass and were larger than ones typically found in Britain.

It suggests that \"whoever is doing this is incredibly wealthy,\" according to Prof Moore, who added \"it challenges the idea that northern Britain was a backwater, when it clearly was not\". \"It has connections to continental Europe and the Roman Empire,\" he said. \"It shows they are of the same status, if not more powerful than the elites in southern Britain.\" Duncan Wilson, chief executive of Historic England which backed the excavation with a £120,000 grant, said: \"Quite simply, this is one of the most important and exciting Iron Age period discoveries made in the UK. \"It sheds new light on Iron Age life in the north and Britain, but it also demonstrates connections with Europe.\" Heritage minister Sir Chris Bryant added: \"The Melsonby Hoard is an extraordinary find, made up of a variety of unique and fascinating objects dating back to Iron Age Britain, which will help us to better understand the fabric of our nation's history.\" The hoard's value was calculated to be £254,000. One of the ditches was examined on-site, while another was extracted as a whole. That ditch has been X-rayed using a large scanner at Southampton University, and will be kept intact as a block to preserve what is inside."
