        "Content": "Donald Trump has said he believes Iran's regime could fall following weeks of unrest across the country, as the US president considers whether to intervene. Preparations for possible action have been under way this week, according to Sky News' partner network NBC News. The Pentagon has tailored options to meet the president's objectives, and they were due to be presented to him on Wednesday, two US officials and a person familiar with the discussions said. Latest updates from Iran The US has already begun withdrawing some military personnel from its Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar, the biggest American military base in the region. Sky News understands UK personnel were also leaving the same base. Mr Trump declared earlier this week that \"help is on its way\" for Iranian protesters who have been met with a brutal crackdown from the regime, fuelling expectations of US military intervention. A total of 2,615 people have been killed in the demonstrations, which began last month, according to the US-based Human Rights Activists News Agency, though other reports have suggested a much higher number. Mr Trump also promised to take \"very strong action\" if the regime in Tehran goes ahead with executing protesters. But speaking in the Oval Office on Wednesday, he claimed he'd been told the \"killing in Iran is stopping\". A family member of one of those facing execution, Erfan Soltani, told Sky News there was no official announcement about his status on Wednesday. But they added that Mr Soltani, 26, who was reportedly arrested last Thursday, could still face execution at any time. Iran's foreign minister Abbas Araghchi claimed in a Fox News interview that no executions were planned. 'Any regime can fail' In an interview with Reuters news agency, Mr Trump said he believed the protests could lead to the fall of the regime, which has been in place since the revolution of 1979. \"Any regime can fail,\" he said, adding: \"Whether or not it falls or not, it's going to be an interesting period of time.\" But he expressed doubt as to whether Iran's exiled crown prince, who has become a prominent voice spurring on protesters, could take over. Mr Trump said Reza Pahlavi \"seems very nice, but I don't ​know how he'd play within his own country\". Read more: Who is Crown Prince Reza Pahlavi? US correspondent Donald Trump sounded like a president stepping back from military action. In an Oval Office news conference, we didn't get a definitive answer on where he goes next on Iran, but we did get a sense of de-escalation. The day before, he'd promised the US would take \"very strong action\" if Iran executed protestors. 24 hours later, he said he’d been informed “the killing has stopped and the executions won't take place\". He was asked did that mean military action was now off the table. His answer was \"we're going to watch and see what the process is, but we were given a very good statement by people aware of what’s going on\". When pushed on military action, he replied: \"We were just told no executions, I hope that’s true, that's a big thing.\" He didn’t confirm how big but to listen to his public statements, it’s clear the issue of executions by the Tehran regime are big in his thinking on what to do next.  It sounded like a step back from a military strike – but he wasn't confirming that. It remains an option and the context, of course, is one where the United States is gearing up for such an action. On Tuesday, Trump outlined to his national security team what he wants any US military action in Iran to achieve. The Pentagon has duly tailored options for presentation to the President.  Elsewhere, America's Western allies remain concerned about the situation across Iran. The British embassy in Tehran has been temporarily closed, and the Foreign Office said it had \"taken the precautionary measure to temporarily withdraw UK staff from Iran\". The UK already advises against all travel to the country. Foreign ministers from the G7 group of nations, which includes the UK, also issued a joint statement on Wednesday to stress they were \"gravely concerned by the developments surrounding the ongoing protests\". \"The members of the G7 remain prepared to impose additional restrictive measures if Iran continues to crack down on protests and dissent in violation of international human rights obligations,\" the statement added.

The government began blocking internet access and international calls last Thursday as protests intensified."

        "Content": "Denmark has said a \"fundamental disagreement\" remains with Donald Trump over Greenland after officials held talks US vice president JD Vance and secretary of state Marco Rubio. Danish foreign minister Lars Lokke Rasmussen said there was a \"frank but also constructive discussion\" during the meeting. \"The discussions focused on how to ensure the long-term security in Greenland, and here our perspectives continue to differ,\" Mr Rasmussen said. \"I must say the president has made his view clear and we have a different position.\" He said there was still a \"fundamental disagreement\" but both sides \"agree to disagree\". The Danish foreign minister also announced a high-level working group will be set up \"to explore if we can find a common way forward\". The group is expected to meet for the first time \"within a matter of weeks\". \"The group, in our view, should focus on how to address the American security concerns, while at the same time respecting the red lines of the Kingdom of Denmark,\" he said. Meanwhile, Greenland's foreign minister Vivian Motzfeldt said the talks were held in a \"respectful way\" and added it is in their interests to \"find the right path\". Trump: 'Unacceptable' if US doesn't control Greenland The talks came after a Truth Social post from Mr Trump, who said it would be \"unacceptable\" if Greenland is not \"in the hands of the United States\". He claimed the territory was \"vital for the Golden Dome\" - a giant, US version of Israel's missile defence system that experts have dismissed as physically implausible. The US president also urged NATO to tell Denmark to keep China and Russia away from Greenland. Leaders of the European Parliament \"unequivocally\" condemned Mr Trump's statements on Greenland and called on the EU Commission and Council to give concrete and tangible support to Greenland and Denmark. \"We respect the wishes of ‌the Greenlanders ⁠and their interests and ‌they can ‍count on us,\" EU Commission president Ursula von der Leyen said earlier on Wednesday. French President Emmanuel Macron echoed her remarks in a cabinet meeting, telling ministers if the sovereignty of ​a European country ⁠and ally was affected, the ​knock-on ​effects would be unprecedented. \"We do ‌not underestimate ⁠statements on Greenland,\" ‌Mr Macron said of US threats. Bolstering military presence in Arctic Both Denmark and Greenland announced that they would raise their military presence in and around the Arctic territory alongside their allies. Danish defence minister Troels Lund Poulsen confirmed Denmark would have a more permanent presence on Greenland going forward. He described a US attack on the island as being completely hypothetical, saying it was unlikely a NATO nation would attack another NATO country. Sweden's prime minister, Ulf Kristersson, announced a similar move, saying several officers from the Swedish Armed Forces were arriving in Greenland on Wednesday. \"They are part of a group from several allied countries. Together, they will prepare for upcoming elements within the framework of the Danish exercise Operation Arctic Endurance,\" he wrote in an online post.

        "Content": "Four astronauts are buckling up for an unexpected return from the International Space Station (ISS) after one of them suffered a \"serious medical condition\".  It's the first time in its 25-year history that a mission is being cut short due to such an incident. NASA will not say which of the four astronauts is affected due to confidentiality, nor will it state what the problem is. The person's condition is said to be stable and the space agency's medical chief, Dr. James Polk, said last week they were \"erring on the side of caution\". The crew in the Dragon Endeavour spacecraft undocked just after 10.20pm UK time and drifted away from the space station. Splashdown off California is being targeted for 8.41am on Thursday, according to an ISS post on X. The crew is made up of Americans Mike Fincke and Zena Cardman, Russian Oleg Platonov and Japanese astronaut Kimiya Yui. They arrived at the ISS via a Space X mission in August and were intending on staying for at least six months. Sky News science correspondent Thomas Moore says up to now, ISS astronauts, backed by a flight surgeon and other medics on the ground, have been able to deal with all medical incidents. These have included a blood clot in the jugular vein of an unnamed astronaut a few years ago. The ISS has more than 190 drugs on board as well as medical equipment, including an ultra-sound machine, defibrillator and an intravenous therapy kit. The emergency means the first planned spacewalk of 2026 has been cancelled. Cardman and Fincke were planning to venture outside to make preparations for some new solar panels. \"I'm proud of the swift effort across the agency thus far to ensure the safety of our astronauts,\" said NASA boss Jared Isaacman.

NASA is planning on taking the 400-tonne space station - which circles the Earth at around 17,500mph - out of orbit in late 2030 or early 2031. The structure will be brought down in the ocean, and the vision is for privately-funded space stations to fill the gap."

        "Content": "\n          Middle East correspondent\n              @adamparsons\n America aims to maintain the momentum of the Gaza peace process, which is why Steve Witkoff ushered in the second phase of the ceasefire before the first had actually come to an end. Not all the hostages have been returned. Those who were alive have all come back, but the remains of Ran Gvili are still somewhere in Gaza, and there are, as yet, no signs that Hamas are about to hand them over. Nothing, it has been said, could happen until they did. But the passage of time exerted political pressure and fears grew that Hamas was using this time to strengthen itself again. So, through a social media message, Witkoff has decided that the wait is over. Phase two, he announced, had been launched. So what actually happens now? If that was your question, it's the right one. But the answer isn't obvious. Three Gaza governing bodies We do know that three different administrative bodies will be created. \n                  US launches phase two of plan to end Gaza conflict, including creation of transitional authority\n                 \n                  Four people killed in Gaza after walls collapse on tents during strong winds, hospital authorities say\n                 \n                  Palestinian embassy in London opens in 'historic moment' \n                 One will be filled with Palestinian technocrats and will be in charge of administering Gaza. At its head will be Ali Shaath, brought up in Gaza and later educated in Belfast, who is an expert in urban planning. Then there is an executive committee, which will contain Witkoff himself, along with Jared Kushner and other American and Israeli officials, some of whom were involved in organising the highly controversial Gaza Humanitarian Foundation - the aid distribution vehicle widely accused of creating a system that was both inefficient and dangerous. And then at the top of the tree will be the so-called Board of Peace, to be chaired by Donald Trump. Its membership is still unknown, but the American president has extended invitations to world leaders, including Keir Starmer and Italy's Giorgia Meloni. Trump, typically, is bullish about its power; others seem more cautious about signing up without knowing what exactly is involved. Challenges include disarming Hamas and withdrawal of Israel Then there are the towering challenges that lie ahead. Under the peace plan, Hamas is supposed to disarm. Does that mean all weapons, or just heavy ones? What actually counts as Hamas? What happens to those weapons? And who's checking? Then there's the promised Israeli withdrawal. There is, frankly, no chance of that happening while Hamas is still armed, and possibly not as long as the group even exists. Which means that Israel will still occupy half of the Strip's land and will still reserve the right to kill those it says pose an immediate threat. Over 400 people have been killed in Gaza since the ceasefire began. And I haven't even mentioned the colossal construction effort that will be required to rebuild Gaza - homes, roads, schools, hospitals, sanitation, power, water treatment. A large percentage of the population, which numbers more than two million, is presently living in tents or ruined buildings, without the most basic of facilities to sustain everyday life. Read more from Sky News:US to suspend immigrant visa processing for 75 countriesDozens killed in Thailand as crane falls on to moving train So will that start, overseen by Mr Shaath and his Palestinian colleagues? Or will construction be blocked by Israel until, say, Hamas disarms? And if that happens, will Trump push for action, tolerate a stalemate or open the door for more military intervention? We simply don't know. Phase two looks like an ironclad set of pledges, but in fact it is really more a blend of aspirations, ambitions, ideas and negotiating positions. It will be complicated, protracted and unpredictable. What it won't be is easy."

        "Headline": "It's been a time of intense public scrutiny for the public as its performance and chief executive have rarely been out of the headlines, as it experiences its second supply issue in as many months. ",
        "Content": "By James Sillars & Sarah Taaffe-Maguire, business and economics reporters  When South East Water (SEW) is in the news, the headlines do not generally make for comfortable reading. While the water and sewerage industry and its regulators have little to cheer about, this water-only supplier is now facing calls to be nationalised - such is the strength of feeling over performance as it grapples with supply chaos. It comes as 23,000 properties had been affected by supply issues across Kent and Sussex, and a major incident was declared in the two counties. People entered a fifth day without water as Storm Goretti caused power cuts and burst pipes on Friday and Saturday last week. It followed a \"water quality issue\" in December, which meant 24,000 people suffered days without water in Tunbridge Wells. A SEW statement on Wednesday said, \"We are very sorry to all our customers who have been affected. \"We know and understand how difficult going without water for such a long period of time is and how difficult it makes everyday life.\" Here, Sky News will examine what's gone wrong at the Kent and Sussex water supplier over many years and why its leadership team is facing such stringent criticism amid accusations of continued rewards for failure. Who owns South East Water? The company, which is responsible for supplies to 2.3 million homes, has been owned by a consortium of mainly foreign investment and pension funds known as HDF Holdings for nearly 20 years. It has long faced criticism over the payments of dividends to shareholders while grappling with high debts, culminating in a fresh £200m cash injection a year ago to keep SEW afloat pending inflation-busting bill hikes agreed by water regulator Ofwat. The 20% increase in the 2025-30 settlement (which is still subject to appeal by the company) was to allow for greater investment in neglected supply infrastructure. The pension fund of lender NatWest also owns a 25% stake in SEW. When approached by Sky News, the NatWest Group pension fund said: \"We are extremely concerned by the impact these incidents are having on the households, businesses and other users who rely on SEW for water services. \"NatWest group pension fund will use its influence as a minority shareholder to direct SEW's board to ensure these issues are fully resolved.\" Why is SEW not working? A water industry source told Sky News that SEW was not fit for purpose, describing it as \"an enormous failure\". \"The company is not as resilient as it needs to be\", they said. \"It's a tiny company that has been patched together. They don't have the interconnectedness to move water around their network like other companies do. They would point to needing more investment in resilience and their appeal is with the CMA now, but I don't think that's the full picture. You can see this is a failing company.\" Latest financial figures for the company's 2024 to 2025 financial year show it recorded a £19.8m loss before tax, less than the £36.7m loss of a year earlier. Why is SEW's boss facing particular criticism? SEW's chief executive, David Hinton, has come in for direct criticism in recent months from local and national politicians as well as Kent residents. After an appearance before the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (EFRA) Committee of MPs last week, where Mr Hinton again suggested working from home was partly to blame for water supply issues, he and senior leadership have been recalled to give evidence. Mr Hinton suggested the rise in people working from home in the commuter area has added to supply pressure, as he did in 2023, to explain a hosepipe ban. The chair of the EFRA committee announced the recall as he was \"deeply sceptical about the company's version of events to date, and its board's track record of holding the company to account\". Mr Hinton's pay rose last year. His annual bonus increased to £115,231, from £112,560 the year before, while his base salary grew to £307,274 from £294,042. What's the regulator done? Perhaps we should be grateful that SEW does not handle storm drains, given the massive penalties handed out by Ofwat in recent years over sewage spills more widely. We have heard little since 2023 when Ofwat opened an investigation into SEW over the reliability of supply following a string of outages - the worst lasting 23 days. It has long faced criticism over leaks, however, and paid a price. The most recent penalties came in 2023/4 when Ofwat announced an £8m fine for a failure to meet targets. That came on top of a further £3.2m charge for supply disruption. SEW has been contacted for comment."

        "Content": "Three Palestine Action hunger strikers have ended their 73-day action after they claimed a key demand was met. On Wednesday, Kamran Ahmed, Heba Muraisi and Lewie Chiaramello announced their decision to end their hunger strikes as Elbit Systems UK failed to win a government contract. Prisoners for Palestine said that Elbit Systems had lost out on a £2 billion contract that would have seen them train 60,000 British troops a year. The campaign group said in a statement: \"Our prisoners' hunger strike will be remembered as a landmark moment of pure defiance; an embarrassment for the British state. \"Banning a group and imprisoning our comrades has backfired on the British state, direct action is alive and the people will drive Elbit out of Britain for good.\" The group had been demanding Palestine Action is de-proscribed and that the UK ends support for companies that supply weapons to Israel.

Reports from friends and family of the hunger strikers suggest they have suffered a range of side effects, including significant weight loss, headaches and lightheadedness. Some have required hospital treatment, including Kamran Ahmed, 28, whose sister told Sky News he suffered a heart complication last week. Birmingham-based neurologist Dr David Nicholl, who has studied prison hunger strikes, told Sky News that months-long hunger strikes can leave lasting health implications, including neurological and cognitive disorders, dementia, vertigo, sight loss and extreme weakness. The hunger strikers have been detained in prison on remand while they await trial for alleged break-ins or criminal damage carried out in the name of Palestine Action before the group was banned under terrorism legislation.

Top cop apologised for providing 'erroneous' evidence Earlier on Wednesday, CC Guildford apologised to MPs for giving them \"erroneous\" evidence about the decision to ban Maccabi fans, blaming the use of AI. The police force announced in October that supporters of Maccabi Tel Aviv would not be able to attend the club's match against Aston Villa in Birmingham the following month, because it had classified the fixture as high risk based on \"current intelligence and previous incidents\", without saying where the threat came from. That decision led to an outcry, with Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer expressing concern, and senior members of West Midlands Police made to appear twice before MPs to answer questions about the ban. The House of Commons Home Affairs Select Committee heard evidence from CC Guildford, as well as others, which led to the Board of Deputies of British Jews and the Jewish Leadership Council jointly calling for him to go."

        "Content": "Footage of the moment a container ship smashed into an oil tanker off the coast of East Yorkshire has been shown in court.  Russian captain Vladimir Motin, 59, was the only watch on duty when his container ship, the Solong, collided with the anchored US tanker Stena Immaculate near the Humber Estuary last March, causing huge fires and explosions. Motin is on trial for the manslaughter of Filipino Mark Angelo Pernia, 38, who had been working at the front of the Solong and died in the incident, although his body was never found. The Old Bailey was shown several audio and video clips of the collision and subsequent blaze by Detective Constable Richard Bayley on Wednesday. One video shows the moment the Solong smashed into the Stena Immaculate at 9.47am on March 10. A loud explosion rings out and plumes of flames and smoke can be seen engulfing both vessels immediately after the crash. American crew members onboard the Stena Immaculate can be heard shouting while alarm bells ring out: \"Holy s***... what just hit us... a container ship... this is no drill, this is no drill, fire fire fire, we have had a collision.\" \n                  Mother named as victim of Withernsea drowning, daughter still missing\n                 \n                  Ship owner files legal claim after North Sea crash\n                 \n                  North Sea: Police given more time to question captain of cargo ship that collided with tanker\n                 A ship's foghorn also repeatedly sounds in the background of the footage. The Stena Immaculate was carrying 220,000 barrels of jet fuel, some of which leaked out when the tanker was hit. In audio footage, Motin can be heard saying \"Stena Immaculate, Stena Immaculate\" a minute after the crash. In a video from the container ship, a male crew member is heard praying: \"Lord help us. Lord help us. Lord help us.\" Crew death 'entirely avoidable' Crew members tried to search for Mr Pernia, but could not access parts of the Solong due to the fire, before Motin ordered them to abandon ship and they boarded a lifeboat. Prosecutor Tom Little KC previously said that the death of Mr Pernia was \"entirely avoidable\". Motin, from Primorsky, St Petersburg, accepted he was the only officer navigating the Solong from 8am on the morning of the collision, his defence barrister James Leonard KC told the court. Solong on autopilot He was aware of the Stena Immaculate via radar and that it was directly in the path of his ship at least nine nautical miles (10.4 miles) away, with the Solong travelling on autopilot at a speed of about 16 knots. When the Solong was about three nautical miles (3.5 miles) away from the Stena Immaculate, Motin had visual sight of the tanker, according to Mr Leonard.

That attempt was not successful and the Solong did not change course at all.\" The barrister asked jurors to think about whether it was \"reasonable\" to wait until the Solong was one nautical mile away before trying to steer away from the Stena Immaculate, and why he waited until that point. The Solong, with 14 crew members, was mainly carrying alcoholic spirits, but also had some hazardous materials on board, including empty but unclean sodium cyanide containers, the court heard. The Stena Immaculate, which had a crew of 23, was transporting the high-grade JetA1 fuel from Greece to the UK. Motin has denied manslaughter. His trial at the Old Bailey was adjourned until Thursday."

The 54-year-old attacked them at a friend's home in Hertfordshire in April 2022 after a night at the pub. The trial heard he bought food, alcohol and cigarettes from a petrol station in the early hours, including a bottle of vodka which the victims drank. Alford had intercourse with the 14-year-old in the garden and a downstairs toilet, and inappropriately touched the 15-year-old while she was half asleep on a sofa.

The jury was shown a video of the 14-year-old's police interview in which she said she'd never had sex before the attack. She told officers: \"I told him to stop because I didn't want to have sex with an old man.\" The younger girl said in a victim statement read on her behalf that the assault \"affected me and my family in every way\".

Jurors heard that 'The Base' is a proscribed terror group which encourages followers to carry out acts of violence in order to ignite a race war. When officers raided the home he shared with his father in a village in Northumberland on 20 February last year, they found his bedroom was adorned with white supremacist flags.

        "Content": "Thousands of properties across South East England will be without water until Friday, after a major incident was declared in Kent and Sussex earlier this week.  Many people entered a fifth day with either no or intermittent water following the recent outages, which South East Water (SEW) blamed on Storm Goretti causing power cuts and burst pipes, resulting in the company's drinking water storage tanks running low. SEW said on Wednesday morning that supplies had been restored to 8,000 properties across the two counties, but later said the total was 16,000. However, it did confirm the 6,500 properties in Tunbridge Wells that had been on a \"boosted system\" had lost supplies for the day. In a statement, SEW incident manager Matthew Dean said: \"Water supplies have now been returned to 15,000 properties in East Grinstead and supplies should be returned to the remaining 1,500 properties tonight [Wednesday]. \"The 6,500 properties in Tunbridge Wells on the boosted system lost supplies earlier today after the water levels in the area's drinking water storage tanks dropped below the level the boosters can run. \"As of 5:30pm today [Wednesday], we are implementing a new recovery plan for Tunbridge Wells which involves keeping local booster pumps switched off for a further 36 hours. Our aim is that customers wake up to a consistent water supply by Friday morning. \"Despite our best efforts, the local drinking water storage tanks have not refilled at the speed required. To resolve this, we must extend the outage to allow the storage tanks to recover fully. \"In total, around 8,000 properties across Tunbridge Wells and East Grinstead are still without water, and we are dealing with some localised issues impacting other parts of Kent.\" Mr Dean added: \"We are very sorry to all our customers who have been affected. \"We know and understand how difficult going without water for such a long period of time is and how difficult it makes everyday life.\" Environment Secretary Emma Reynolds visited Tunbridge Wells on Wednesday and said the government has asked Ofwat, the water regulator, to review whether the company has breached its licence. SEW bosses have been recalled to appear before MPs over a separate water outage which left 24,000 properties in Tunbridge Wells without drinkable water for almost two weeks in December. Alistair Carmichael, chairman of the Parliamentary Environment, Food and Rural Affairs committee, said he and his colleagues remained \"deeply sceptical\" about the company's version of events on the supply failure. A South East Water spokesperson said: \"We have fully complied with the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs Committee's request for information to date and we will continue to provide any further information requested. \"This will include attending any further meetings that are required.\" Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey on Wednesday called for SEW to be stripped of its licence for \"failing its customers over and over again\". Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer, who called the situation \"totally unacceptable, said ministers are holding \"daily emergency meetings\" about the ongoing outages.

        "Content": "By James Sillars & Sarah Taaffe-Maguire, business and economics reporters  When South East Water (SEW) is in the news, the headlines do not generally make for comfortable reading. While the water and sewerage industry and its regulators have little to cheer about, this water-only supplier is now facing calls to be nationalised - such is the strength of feeling over performance as it grapples with supply chaos. It comes as 23,000 properties had been affected by supply issues across Kent and Sussex, and a major incident was declared in the two counties. People entered a fifth day without water as Storm Goretti caused power cuts and burst pipes on Friday and Saturday last week. It followed a \"water quality issue\" in December, which meant 24,000 people suffered days without water in Tunbridge Wells. A SEW statement on Wednesday said, \"We are very sorry to all our customers who have been affected. \"We know and understand how difficult going without water for such a long period of time is and how difficult it makes everyday life.\" Here, Sky News will examine what's gone wrong at the Kent and Sussex water supplier over many years and why its leadership team is facing such stringent criticism amid accusations of continued rewards for failure. Who owns South East Water? The company, which is responsible for supplies to 2.3 million homes, has been owned by a consortium of mainly foreign investment and pension funds known as HDF Holdings for nearly 20 years. It has long faced criticism over the payments of dividends to shareholders while grappling with high debts, culminating in a fresh £200m cash injection a year ago to keep SEW afloat pending inflation-busting bill hikes agreed by water regulator Ofwat. The 20% increase in the 2025-30 settlement (which is still subject to appeal by the company) was to allow for greater investment in neglected supply infrastructure. The pension fund of lender NatWest also owns a 25% stake in SEW. When approached by Sky News, the NatWest Group pension fund said: \"We are extremely concerned by the impact these incidents are having on the households, businesses and other users who rely on SEW for water services. \"NatWest group pension fund will use its influence as a minority shareholder to direct SEW's board to ensure these issues are fully resolved.\" Why is SEW not working? A water industry source told Sky News that SEW was not fit for purpose, describing it as \"an enormous failure\". \"The company is not as resilient as it needs to be\", they said. \"It's a tiny company that has been patched together. They don't have the interconnectedness to move water around their network like other companies do. They would point to needing more investment in resilience and their appeal is with the CMA now, but I don't think that's the full picture. You can see this is a failing company.\" Latest financial figures for the company's 2024 to 2025 financial year show it recorded a £19.8m loss before tax, less than the £36.7m loss of a year earlier. Why is SEW's boss facing particular criticism? SEW's chief executive, David Hinton, has come in for direct criticism in recent months from local and national politicians as well as Kent residents. After an appearance before the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (EFRA) Committee of MPs last week, where Mr Hinton again suggested working from home was partly to blame for water supply issues, he and senior leadership have been recalled to give evidence. Mr Hinton suggested the rise in people working from home in the commuter area has added to supply pressure, as he did in 2023, to explain a hosepipe ban. The chair of the EFRA committee announced the recall as he was \"deeply sceptical about the company's version of events to date, and its board's track record of holding the company to account\". Mr Hinton's pay rose last year. His annual bonus increased to £115,231, from £112,560 the year before, while his base salary grew to £307,274 from £294,042. What's the regulator done? Perhaps we should be grateful that SEW does not handle storm drains, given the massive penalties handed out by Ofwat in recent years over sewage spills more widely. We have heard little since 2023 when Ofwat opened an investigation into SEW over the reliability of supply following a string of outages - the worst lasting 23 days. It has long faced criticism over leaks, however, and paid a price. The most recent penalties came in 2023/4 when Ofwat announced an £8m fine for a failure to meet targets. That came on top of a further £3.2m charge for supply disruption. SEW has been contacted for comment."

Andrew Pickering, 50, crashed to the ground several times as the ladder he was using gave way from under him during a raid at a petrol station in County Durham.

The force published clips of the attempted burglary on its Facebook page on Tuesday with the caption: \"It's not about how many times you fall, but how many times you get back up.\" The force's video, backed by Strauss's Blue Danube waltz, edits together CCTV footage from the petrol station in Ouston, in Chester-Le-Street, and clips of Pickering watching the footage in a police interrogation room. It was also posted to the Durham Constabulary's YouTube account, amassing more than 29,000 views in a day.

        "Content": "Three Palestine Action hunger strikers have ended their 73-day action after they claimed a key demand was met. On Wednesday, Kamran Ahmed, Heba Muraisi and Lewie Chiaramello announced their decision to end their hunger strikes as Elbit Systems UK failed to win a government contract. Prisoners for Palestine said that Elbit Systems had lost out on a £2 billion contract that would have seen them train 60,000 British troops a year. The campaign group said in a statement: \"Our prisoners' hunger strike will be remembered as a landmark moment of pure defiance; an embarrassment for the British state. \"Banning a group and imprisoning our comrades has backfired on the British state, direct action is alive and the people will drive Elbit out of Britain for good.\" The group had been demanding Palestine Action is de-proscribed and that the UK ends support for companies that supply weapons to Israel. In a statement, Mr Chiaramello, a Type 1 diabetic, said: \"We do this because of Palestine, because we've been inspired, because we've been empowered to take action and to try to realise our dreams for a free Palestine, for an emancipated world.\" \n                  Palestine Action activist on hunger strike for nearly 70 days 'deteriorating'\n                 \n                  Palestine Action detainee taken to hospital after 58 days of hunger strike, family says\n                 \n                  Remaining Palestine Action hunger strikers have the resolve to continue, families say\n                 Within the last month, four other detained hunger strikers, Teuta Hoxha, Jon Cink, Qesser Zuhrah and Amu Gib, also began re-feeding. Reports from friends and family of the hunger strikers suggest they have suffered a range of side effects, including significant weight loss, headaches and lightheadedness. Some have required hospital treatment, including Kamran Ahmed, 28, whose sister told Sky News he suffered a heart complication last week. Birmingham-based neurologist Dr David Nicholl, who has studied prison hunger strikes, told Sky News that months-long hunger strikes can leave lasting health implications, including neurological and cognitive disorders, dementia, vertigo, sight loss and extreme weakness. The hunger strikers have been detained in prison on remand while they await trial for alleged break-ins or criminal damage carried out in the name of Palestine Action before the group was banned under terrorism legislation. By the time they are tried, all will have spent more than a year in custody.

        "Content": "Footage of the moment a container ship smashed into an oil tanker off the coast of East Yorkshire has been shown in court.  Russian captain Vladimir Motin, 59, was the only watch on duty when his container ship, the Solong, collided with the anchored US tanker Stena Immaculate near the Humber Estuary last March, causing huge fires and explosions. Motin is on trial for the manslaughter of Filipino Mark Angelo Pernia, 38, who had been working at the front of the Solong and died in the incident, although his body was never found. The Old Bailey was shown several audio and video clips of the collision and subsequent blaze by Detective Constable Richard Bayley on Wednesday. One video shows the moment the Solong smashed into the Stena Immaculate at 9.47am on March 10. A loud explosion rings out and plumes of flames and smoke can be seen engulfing both vessels immediately after the crash. American crew members onboard the Stena Immaculate can be heard shouting while alarm bells ring out: \"Holy s***... what just hit us... a container ship... this is no drill, this is no drill, fire fire fire, we have had a collision.\" \n                  Mother named as victim of Withernsea drowning, daughter still missing\n                 \n                  Ship owner files legal claim after North Sea crash\n                 \n                  North Sea: Police given more time to question captain of cargo ship that collided with tanker\n                 A ship's foghorn also repeatedly sounds in the background of the footage. The Stena Immaculate was carrying 220,000 barrels of jet fuel, some of which leaked out when the tanker was hit. In audio footage, Motin can be heard saying \"Stena Immaculate, Stena Immaculate\" a minute after the crash. In a video from the container ship, a male crew member is heard praying: \"Lord help us. Lord help us. Lord help us.\" Crew death 'entirely avoidable' Crew members tried to search for Mr Pernia, but could not access parts of the Solong due to the fire, before Motin ordered them to abandon ship and they boarded a lifeboat. Prosecutor Tom Little KC previously said that the death of Mr Pernia was \"entirely avoidable\". Motin, from Primorsky, St Petersburg, accepted he was the only officer navigating the Solong from 8am on the morning of the collision, his defence barrister James Leonard KC told the court. Solong on autopilot He was aware of the Stena Immaculate via radar and that it was directly in the path of his ship at least nine nautical miles (10.4 miles) away, with the Solong travelling on autopilot at a speed of about 16 knots. When the Solong was about three nautical miles (3.5 miles) away from the Stena Immaculate, Motin had visual sight of the tanker, according to Mr Leonard. Read more from Sky News:Thousands of properties still without waterPalestine Action hunger strikers end 73-day protest \"The defendant will say that when he was approximately one nautical mile away from the Stena Immaculate's position, he tried to take the Solong out of autopilot so as to attempt to change course to starboard manually, passing to the Stena Immaculate's stern,\" Mr Leonard told jurors. \"There is no dispute that had he changed course in the way he intended, there would have been no collision. That attempt was not successful and the Solong did not change course at all.\" The barrister asked jurors to think about whether it was \"reasonable\" to wait until the Solong was one nautical mile away before trying to steer away from the Stena Immaculate, and why he waited until that point. The Solong, with 14 crew members, was mainly carrying alcoholic spirits, but also had some hazardous materials on board, including empty but unclean sodium cyanide containers, the court heard. The Stena Immaculate, which had a crew of 23, was transporting the high-grade JetA1 fuel from Greece to the UK. Motin has denied manslaughter. His trial at the Old Bailey was adjourned until Thursday."

        "Content": "\n          news reporter\n       Ten British \"far-right activists\" have been banned from France for \"reconnaissance and destruction activities\" against small boats used in migrant crossings. The country's interior ministry said in a statement that the individuals were identified as part of the Raise the Colours movement. Raise the Colours told Sky News it has not received formal notification of the bans, and said it \"has always maintained that its activities must remain peaceful and within the law\". The French ministry said the 10 \"engaged, in particular, in reconnaissance and destruction activities targeting small boats, as well as in propaganda activities along the French coastline\". It said those banned on Tuesday were \"far-right activists\" who took part in operations in the Nord and Pas-de-Calais areas in December. The 10, which have not been named, are now prohibited from entering and staying in France. \"These actions were aimed at a British audience, calling on them to bolster the ranks of the movement in order to put an end to migration,\" the ministry added. Videos posted by Raise the Colours on X in December, seen by Sky News, show some members of the group saying they are in France to stop small boats used by migrants from illegally crossing the English Channel. One video, posted on 5 December, shows an inflatable small boat destroyed, with the caption: \"Some people say 'Stop The Boats' we actually STOP THE BOATS.\" Sky News could not verify the location of that post. Other posts by the account, under what it calls Operation Overload, suggest the videos online are filmed in France. The group came to prominence last summer as part of a collective movement to display the Union Flag and St George's flag - which do not often appear outside sporting, royal or military events - across the country. According to its website, Raise the Colours is a \"lawful, civic movement\", but added \"individuals connected to our movement have filmed and recorded events in northern France in order to uncover and expose what is happening around illegal Channel crossings\". It says it does \"not encourage, endorse or support anyone travelling to France, approaching migrant vessels, or attempting to intervene in crossings\". \"Any individual choosing to travel abroad or take physical action does so entirely on their own initiative and without our support, approval or encouragement,\" it added. In a statement to Sky News about the bans, Raise the Colours said: \"At the time of issuing this statement, no formal notification has been received by Raise the Colours regarding any administrative measures.\" Read more from Sky News:Small boat crossings in 2025 second highest everPower to seize phones comes into force The group said it understands \"the statements refer to administrative decisions concerning specific individuals, rather than the organisation as a whole,\" and added that \"any official correspondence will be reviewed if and when it is received through the appropriate channels\". It then reiterated that Raise the Colours \"has always maintained that its activities must remain peaceful and within the law\" and it \"does not support violence or any unlawful activity\" - citing a \"structured recruitment and screening process we have put in place\". \"We respect the authority of national governments to maintain public order and will continue to act responsibly and diligently moving forward in our endeavours to stop the illegal invasion of our country.\" Sky News has contacted the Home Office for comment."

Preparations for possible action have been under way this week, according to Sky News' partner network NBC News. The Pentagon has tailored options to meet the president's objectives, and they were due to be presented to him on Wednesday, two US officials and a person familiar with the discussions said. Latest updates from Iran The US has already begun withdrawing some military personnel from its Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar, the biggest American military base in the region. Sky News understands UK personnel were also leaving the same base. Mr Trump declared earlier this week that \"help is on its way\" for Iranian protesters who have been met with a brutal crackdown from the regime, fuelling expectations of US military intervention. A total of 2,615 people have been killed in the demonstrations, which began last month, according to the US-based Human Rights Activists News Agency, though other reports have suggested a much higher number. Mr Trump also promised to take \"very strong action\" if the regime in Tehran goes ahead with executing protesters. But speaking in the Oval Office on Wednesday, he claimed he'd been told the \"killing in Iran is stopping\". A family member of one of those facing execution, Erfan Soltani, told Sky News there was no official announcement about his status on Wednesday. But they added that Mr Soltani, 26, who was reportedly arrested last Thursday, could still face execution at any time. Iran's foreign minister Abbas Araghchi claimed in a Fox News interview that no executions were planned. 'Any regime can fail' In an interview with Reuters news agency, Mr Trump said he believed the protests could lead to the fall of the regime, which has been in place since the revolution of 1979. \"Any regime can fail,\" he said, adding: \"Whether or not it falls or not, it's going to be an interesting period of time.\" But he expressed doubt as to whether Iran's exiled crown prince, who has become a prominent voice spurring on protesters, could take over. Mr Trump said Reza Pahlavi \"seems very nice, but I don't ​know how he'd play within his own country\". Read more: Who is Crown Prince Reza Pahlavi? US correspondent Donald Trump sounded like a president stepping back from military action. In an Oval Office news conference, we didn't get a definitive answer on where he goes next on Iran, but we did get a sense of de-escalation. The day before, he'd promised the US would take \"very strong action\" if Iran executed protestors. 24 hours later, he said he’d been informed “the killing has stopped and the executions won't take place\". He was asked did that mean military action was now off the table. His answer was \"we're going to watch and see what the process is, but we were given a very good statement by people aware of what’s going on\". When pushed on military action, he replied: \"We were just told no executions, I hope that’s true, that's a big thing.\" He didn’t confirm how big but to listen to his public statements, it’s clear the issue of executions by the Tehran regime are big in his thinking on what to do next.  It sounded like a step back from a military strike – but he wasn't confirming that. It remains an option and the context, of course, is one where the United States is gearing up for such an action. On Tuesday, Trump outlined to his national security team what he wants any US military action in Iran to achieve. The Pentagon has duly tailored options for presentation to the President.  Elsewhere, America's Western allies remain concerned about the situation across Iran. The British embassy in Tehran has been temporarily closed, and the Foreign Office said it had \"taken the precautionary measure to temporarily withdraw UK staff from Iran\". The UK already advises against all travel to the country. Foreign ministers from the G7 group of nations, which includes the UK, also issued a joint statement on Wednesday to stress they were \"gravely concerned by the developments surrounding the ongoing protests\". \"The members of the G7 remain prepared to impose additional restrictive measures if Iran continues to crack down on protests and dissent in violation of international human rights obligations,\" the statement added.

Danish foreign minister Lars Lokke Rasmussen said there was a \"frank but also constructive discussion\" during the meeting. \"The discussions focused on how to ensure the long-term security in Greenland, and here our perspectives continue to differ,\" Mr Rasmussen said. \"I must say the president has made his view clear and we have a different position.\" He said there was still a \"fundamental disagreement\" but both sides \"agree to disagree\". The Danish foreign minister also announced a high-level working group will be set up \"to explore if we can find a common way forward\". The group is expected to meet for the first time \"within a matter of weeks\". \"The group, in our view, should focus on how to address the American security concerns, while at the same time respecting the red lines of the Kingdom of Denmark,\" he said. Meanwhile, Greenland's foreign minister Vivian Motzfeldt said the talks were held in a \"respectful way\" and added it is in their interests to \"find the right path\". Trump: 'Unacceptable' if US doesn't control Greenland The talks came after a Truth Social post from Mr Trump, who said it would be \"unacceptable\" if Greenland is not \"in the hands of the United States\". He claimed the territory was \"vital for the Golden Dome\" - a giant, US version of Israel's missile defence system that experts have dismissed as physically implausible. The US president also urged NATO to tell Denmark to keep China and Russia away from Greenland. Leaders of the European Parliament \"unequivocally\" condemned Mr Trump's statements on Greenland and called on the EU Commission and Council to give concrete and tangible support to Greenland and Denmark. \"We respect the wishes of ‌the Greenlanders ⁠and their interests and ‌they can ‍count on us,\" EU Commission president Ursula von der Leyen said earlier on Wednesday. French President Emmanuel Macron echoed her remarks in a cabinet meeting, telling ministers if the sovereignty of ​a European country ⁠and ally was affected, the ​knock-on ​effects would be unprecedented. \"We do ‌not underestimate ⁠statements on Greenland,\" ‌Mr Macron said of US threats. Bolstering military presence in Arctic Both Denmark and Greenland announced that they would raise their military presence in and around the Arctic territory alongside their allies. Danish defence minister Troels Lund Poulsen confirmed Denmark would have a more permanent presence on Greenland going forward. He described a US attack on the island as being completely hypothetical, saying it was unlikely a NATO nation would attack another NATO country. Sweden's prime minister, Ulf Kristersson, announced a similar move, saying several officers from the Swedish Armed Forces were arriving in Greenland on Wednesday. \"They are part of a group from several allied countries. Together, they will prepare for upcoming elements within the framework of the Danish exercise Operation Arctic Endurance,\" he wrote in an online post.

It includes disarming Hamas, rebuilding the war-ravaged territory and establishing a group of Palestinian experts to govern Gaza under American supervision.

And they are endorsing it.\" The mediators of the ceasefire deal - Egypt, Turkey and Qatar - welcomed the establishment of the NCAG and said it would be led by Ali Shaath, a former deputy minister in the Palestinian Authority. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said diplomat Nickolay Mladenov, a former Bulgarian defence and foreign minister who served as UN envoy to Iraq, has been selected as the Board of Peace's director-general. Sky's Middle East correspondent, Adam Parsons, said that \"as for the second phase, it's enormously complicated.

Although the two sides accuse ‌each other of breaching the deal, Donald Trump says he wants to move on to the second phase.

        "Content": "\n          Sky correspondent\n              @sallylockwood\n \"It was war.\" That is how a young Iranian woman describes what she witnessed on the streets of Tehran before managing to escape the country on a flight to Dubai. What is happening inside Iran has been even harder than usual to verify after the country was plunged into a near-total internet blackout. For five days, most Iranians were unable to contact the outside world. Only now have limited phone connections begun to return. This woman, who fears for the safety of family members still in Iran, asked not to be identified. For the purposes of this article, I will call her Leila. She believes what she saw - and what she carried out with her - is information the world urgently needs to hear. Follow latest: Iran vows revenge if US attacks \"Everyone was being shot in the head,\" she says, describing the protests that erupted nightly in her neighbourhood in northern Tehran. \"I don't think they have space in the jails anymore, so they're just killing us.\" Leila left Iran on Sunday night, after several days of escalating unrest that began on Thursday, when much of the country lost contact with the outside world. Each evening, she says, protesters gathered in the streets. Others shouted from their apartment windows: \"Death to Khamenei\" and \"Bring back Reza Pahlavi,\" calling for an end to the Islamic Republic and a return of the Shah. \"There were lots and lots of people being sprayed with tear gas. It burned our lips and our eyes,\" she says. She describes watching a member of Iran's Revolutionary Guard point a gun at a mother sitting in a car with a toddler in the back seat. The child was crying. The woman was not shot - but others were. \"I saw two guys by a mosque,\" Leila says. \"One of them was just shot in the head. \"We hid in a side street. When we came back a few minutes later, the body was already gone.\" Leila says people she knew personally were killed, too. \"My friend's cousin was shot five times. He died,\" she says. \"People around me were being killed.\" In recent days, Iranian authorities have insisted the situation is \"under control\". State television has announced that schools, banks and businesses will remain closed this week - officially due to pollution. Leila's account paints a very different picture. During the day, she says, the streets were quieter. People spoke in hushed voices. She overheard whispered conversations: \"Did you hear my friend's brother is dead?\" By evening, the streets filled again. On Friday, she says the area around Tehran University resembled a war zone. On Saturday and Sunday, protests began even earlier - around 6pm. \"It wasn't just young people,\" she says. \"There were old people, religious people, women wearing hijab. \"Even very Islamic people were protesting and calling for the return of the Shah.\" Read more on Iran:How did protests start and why is Trump involved?Verifying protests and deaths amid brutal crackdown Leila holds dual nationality and had already planned to leave Iran this week. Her original flight was cancelled. With internet access cut, she travelled to the airport in person on Sunday to see whether she could get out. After securing a seat on an Iranian airline, her mother begged her to delete the photos and videos she had taken of the protests. The images included bloodstained streets and a dead body. At the departure gate, she says she was approached by a member of Iran's security services. \"He knew my final destination,\" she says. \"He asked how long I had lived there and why. He asked to see my phone and went through my photos. \"I was terrified - it felt like he knew everything about me.\" She believes that if the images had been found, she would have been imprisoned indefinitely.

Like many now speaking from outside the country, Leila says she wants international intervention - including from the United States. \"Without help from the outside, they just kill everyone,\" she says. \"This time, everybody is out on the streets. It doesn't matter if you're rich or poor, religious or not, old or young. \"Everybody wants these people gone. But it's super difficult,\" she adds. \"They've cut the internet.

        "Content": "\n          Middle East correspondent\n              @adamparsons\n America aims to maintain the momentum of the Gaza peace process, which is why Steve Witkoff ushered in the second phase of the ceasefire before the first had actually come to an end. Not all the hostages have been returned. Those who were alive have all come back, but the remains of Ran Gvili are still somewhere in Gaza, and there are, as yet, no signs that Hamas are about to hand them over. Nothing, it has been said, could happen until they did. But the passage of time exerted political pressure and fears grew that Hamas was using this time to strengthen itself again. So, through a social media message, Witkoff has decided that the wait is over. Phase two, he announced, had been launched. So what actually happens now? If that was your question, it's the right one. But the answer isn't obvious. Three Gaza governing bodies We do know that three different administrative bodies will be created. \n                  US launches phase two of plan to end Gaza conflict, including creation of transitional authority\n                 \n                  Four people killed in Gaza after walls collapse on tents during strong winds, hospital authorities say\n                 \n                  Palestinian embassy in London opens in 'historic moment' \n                 One will be filled with Palestinian technocrats and will be in charge of administering Gaza. At its head will be Ali Shaath, brought up in Gaza and later educated in Belfast, who is an expert in urban planning. Then there is an executive committee, which will contain Witkoff himself, along with Jared Kushner and other American and Israeli officials, some of whom were involved in organising the highly controversial Gaza Humanitarian Foundation - the aid distribution vehicle widely accused of creating a system that was both inefficient and dangerous. And then at the top of the tree will be the so-called Board of Peace, to be chaired by Donald Trump. Its membership is still unknown, but the American president has extended invitations to world leaders, including Keir Starmer and Italy's Giorgia Meloni. Trump, typically, is bullish about its power; others seem more cautious about signing up without knowing what exactly is involved. Challenges include disarming Hamas and withdrawal of Israel Then there are the towering challenges that lie ahead. Under the peace plan, Hamas is supposed to disarm. Does that mean all weapons, or just heavy ones? What actually counts as Hamas? What happens to those weapons? And who's checking? Then there's the promised Israeli withdrawal. There is, frankly, no chance of that happening while Hamas is still armed, and possibly not as long as the group even exists. Which means that Israel will still occupy half of the Strip's land and will still reserve the right to kill those it says pose an immediate threat. Over 400 people have been killed in Gaza since the ceasefire began. And I haven't even mentioned the colossal construction effort that will be required to rebuild Gaza - homes, roads, schools, hospitals, sanitation, power, water treatment. A large percentage of the population, which numbers more than two million, is presently living in tents or ruined buildings, without the most basic of facilities to sustain everyday life. Read more from Sky News:US to suspend immigrant visa processing for 75 countriesDozens killed in Thailand as crane falls on to moving train So will that start, overseen by Mr Shaath and his Palestinian colleagues? Or will construction be blocked by Israel until, say, Hamas disarms? And if that happens, will Trump push for action, tolerate a stalemate or open the door for more military intervention? We simply don't know. Phase two looks like an ironclad set of pledges, but in fact it is really more a blend of aspirations, ambitions, ideas and negotiating positions. It will be complicated, protracted and unpredictable. What it won't be is easy."

It's the first time in its 25-year history that a mission is being cut short due to such an incident.

The person's condition is said to be stable and the space agency's medical chief, Dr. James Polk, said last week they were \"erring on the side of caution\".

The crew is made up of Americans Mike Fincke and Zena Cardman, Russian Oleg Platonov and Japanese astronaut Kimiya Yui. They arrived at the ISS via a Space X mission in August and were intending on staying for at least six months. Sky News science correspondent Thomas Moore says up to now, ISS astronauts, backed by a flight surgeon and other medics on the ground, have been able to deal with all medical incidents. These have included a blood clot in the jugular vein of an unnamed astronaut a few years ago. The ISS has more than 190 drugs on board as well as medical equipment, including an ultra-sound machine, defibrillator and an intravenous therapy kit. The emergency means the first planned spacewalk of 2026 has been cancelled.

        "Content": "\n          news reporter\n       Ten British \"far-right activists\" have been banned from France for \"reconnaissance and destruction activities\" against small boats used in migrant crossings. The country's interior ministry said in a statement that the individuals were identified as part of the Raise the Colours movement. Raise the Colours told Sky News it has not received formal notification of the bans, and said it \"has always maintained that its activities must remain peaceful and within the law\". The French ministry said the 10 \"engaged, in particular, in reconnaissance and destruction activities targeting small boats, as well as in propaganda activities along the French coastline\". It said those banned on Tuesday were \"far-right activists\" who took part in operations in the Nord and Pas-de-Calais areas in December. The 10, which have not been named, are now prohibited from entering and staying in France. \"These actions were aimed at a British audience, calling on them to bolster the ranks of the movement in order to put an end to migration,\" the ministry added. Videos posted by Raise the Colours on X in December, seen by Sky News, show some members of the group saying they are in France to stop small boats used by migrants from illegally crossing the English Channel. One video, posted on 5 December, shows an inflatable small boat destroyed, with the caption: \"Some people say 'Stop The Boats' we actually STOP THE BOATS.\" Sky News could not verify the location of that post. Other posts by the account, under what it calls Operation Overload, suggest the videos online are filmed in France. The group came to prominence last summer as part of a collective movement to display the Union Flag and St George's flag - which do not often appear outside sporting, royal or military events - across the country. According to its website, Raise the Colours is a \"lawful, civic movement\", but added \"individuals connected to our movement have filmed and recorded events in northern France in order to uncover and expose what is happening around illegal Channel crossings\". It says it does \"not encourage, endorse or support anyone travelling to France, approaching migrant vessels, or attempting to intervene in crossings\". \"Any individual choosing to travel abroad or take physical action does so entirely on their own initiative and without our support, approval or encouragement,\" it added. In a statement to Sky News about the bans, Raise the Colours said: \"At the time of issuing this statement, no formal notification has been received by Raise the Colours regarding any administrative measures.\" Read more from Sky News:Small boat crossings in 2025 second highest everPower to seize phones comes into force The group said it understands \"the statements refer to administrative decisions concerning specific individuals, rather than the organisation as a whole,\" and added that \"any official correspondence will be reviewed if and when it is received through the appropriate channels\". It then reiterated that Raise the Colours \"has always maintained that its activities must remain peaceful and within the law\" and it \"does not support violence or any unlawful activity\" - citing a \"structured recruitment and screening process we have put in place\". \"We respect the authority of national governments to maintain public order and will continue to act responsibly and diligently moving forward in our endeavours to stop the illegal invasion of our country.\" Sky News has contacted the Home Office for comment."

The singer is accused of sexually assaulting the workers in his Caribbean residences between January and October 2021.

Jordan Smith, 29, beat the 24-year-old on his way to claiming the jackpot at the One Point Slam in Australia. The new format allows amateurs to compete with the best players over one-point matches - with the tournament winner taking home $1m (£490,000). Amateurs inside Melbourne Park were given two serves, but the pros only had one. Smith knocked out Sinner when the Italian's serve failed to clear the net. The Sydney player went on to defeat British-born Taiwanese player Joanna Garland, 24, in the final. Garland - the world number 117 - reached the showdown after beating Alexander Zverev, Nick Kyrgios, Maria Sakkari and Donna Vekic. \n                  Iran's regime could fall, says Trump - as US president considers intervention\n                 \n                  Denmark says 'fundamental disagreement' remains with Trump - but agrees to high-level talks over Greenland\n                 \n                  US launches phase two of plan to end Gaza conflict, including creation of transitional authority\n                 Other big names taking part included Carlos Alcaraz, Francis Tiafoe and Daniil Medvedev.

        "Content": "Donald Trump has said he believes Iran's regime could fall following weeks of unrest across the country, as the US president considers whether to intervene. Preparations for possible action have been under way this week, according to Sky News' partner network NBC News. The Pentagon has tailored options to meet the president's objectives, and they were due to be presented to him on Wednesday, two US officials and a person familiar with the discussions said. Latest updates from Iran The US has already begun withdrawing some military personnel from its Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar, the biggest American military base in the region. Sky News understands UK personnel were also leaving the same base. Mr Trump declared earlier this week that \"help is on its way\" for Iranian protesters who have been met with a brutal crackdown from the regime, fuelling expectations of US military intervention. A total of 2,615 people have been killed in the demonstrations, which began last month, according to the US-based Human Rights Activists News Agency, though other reports have suggested a much higher number. Mr Trump also promised to take \"very strong action\" if the regime in Tehran goes ahead with executing protesters. But speaking in the Oval Office on Wednesday, he claimed he'd been told the \"killing in Iran is stopping\". A family member of one of those facing execution, Erfan Soltani, told Sky News there was no official announcement about his status on Wednesday. But they added that Mr Soltani, 26, who was reportedly arrested last Thursday, could still face execution at any time. Iran's foreign minister Abbas Araghchi claimed in a Fox News interview that no executions were planned. 'Any regime can fail' In an interview with Reuters news agency, Mr Trump said he believed the protests could lead to the fall of the regime, which has been in place since the revolution of 1979. \"Any regime can fail,\" he said, adding: \"Whether or not it falls or not, it's going to be an interesting period of time.\" But he expressed doubt as to whether Iran's exiled crown prince, who has become a prominent voice spurring on protesters, could take over. Mr Trump said Reza Pahlavi \"seems very nice, but I don't ​know how he'd play within his own country\". Read more: Who is Crown Prince Reza Pahlavi? US correspondent Donald Trump sounded like a president stepping back from military action. In an Oval Office news conference, we didn't get a definitive answer on where he goes next on Iran, but we did get a sense of de-escalation. The day before, he'd promised the US would take \"very strong action\" if Iran executed protestors. 24 hours later, he said he’d been informed “the killing has stopped and the executions won't take place\". He was asked did that mean military action was now off the table. His answer was \"we're going to watch and see what the process is, but we were given a very good statement by people aware of what’s going on\". When pushed on military action, he replied: \"We were just told no executions, I hope that’s true, that's a big thing.\" He didn’t confirm how big but to listen to his public statements, it’s clear the issue of executions by the Tehran regime are big in his thinking on what to do next.  It sounded like a step back from a military strike – but he wasn't confirming that. It remains an option and the context, of course, is one where the United States is gearing up for such an action. On Tuesday, Trump outlined to his national security team what he wants any US military action in Iran to achieve. The Pentagon has duly tailored options for presentation to the President.  Elsewhere, America's Western allies remain concerned about the situation across Iran. The British embassy in Tehran has been temporarily closed, and the Foreign Office said it had \"taken the precautionary measure to temporarily withdraw UK staff from Iran\". The UK already advises against all travel to the country. Foreign ministers from the G7 group of nations, which includes the UK, also issued a joint statement on Wednesday to stress they were \"gravely concerned by the developments surrounding the ongoing protests\". \"The members of the G7 remain prepared to impose additional restrictive measures if Iran continues to crack down on protests and dissent in violation of international human rights obligations,\" the statement added.

It's the first time in its 25-year history that a mission is being cut short due to such an incident. NASA will not say which of the four astronauts is affected due to confidentiality, nor will it state what the problem is. The person's condition is said to be stable and the space agency's medical chief, Dr. James Polk, said last week they were \"erring on the side of caution\". The crew in the Dragon Endeavour spacecraft undocked just after 10.20pm UK time and drifted away from the space station. Splashdown off California is being targeted for 8.41am on Thursday, according to an ISS post on X. The crew is made up of Americans Mike Fincke and Zena Cardman, Russian Oleg Platonov and Japanese astronaut Kimiya Yui. They arrived at the ISS via a Space X mission in August and were intending on staying for at least six months. Sky News science correspondent Thomas Moore says up to now, ISS astronauts, backed by a flight surgeon and other medics on the ground, have been able to deal with all medical incidents. These have included a blood clot in the jugular vein of an unnamed astronaut a few years ago. The ISS has more than 190 drugs on board as well as medical equipment, including an ultra-sound machine, defibrillator and an intravenous therapy kit. The emergency means the first planned spacewalk of 2026 has been cancelled. Cardman and Fincke were planning to venture outside to make preparations for some new solar panels. \"I'm proud of the swift effort across the agency thus far to ensure the safety of our astronauts,\" said NASA boss Jared Isaacman.

The structure will be brought down in the ocean, and the vision is for privately-funded space stations to fill the gap."

Applicants from countries including Iran, Russia, Afghanistan, Somalia, ⁠Thailand and Brazil will be impacted by the pause, due to begin on 21 January, as the Trump administration continues its crackdown on immigration. The Department of State said the pause will bring \"an end to the abuse of America's immigration system by those who would extract wealth from the American people\". The principal deputy spokesperson for the department, Tommy Pigott, said the suspension - which does not impact short-term visas including those for the 2026 men's football World Cup - is being implemented in a bid \"to prevent the entry ‌of foreign nationals who would take welfare and public benefits\". He added: \"The State Department ​will use its long-standing authority to deem ineligible potential immigrants who ​would become a public charge on the United States and exploit the generosity of the American people.\" The decision comes amid a growing presence of Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers in cities across the US, including in Minneapolis, where Renee Good, a 37-year-old mother of three, was shot dead in her car last week during an ICE operation. In December, the Trump administration paused immigration applications submitted by nationals from 19 countries that were banned from travel earlier in 2025, according to a US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) policy document. \n                  Iran's regime could fall, says Trump - as US president considers intervention\n                 \n                  Trump restates desire to take over Greenland, as poll finds most Americans are against it\n                 \n                  Tehran on the brink as Trump calls for Iranians to take to the streets\n                 In a post on X, the Department of State, which said on Monday it has revoked more than 100,000 visas since Mr Trump took office, said: \"The freeze will remain active until the US can ensure that new immigrants will not extract wealth from the American people\".

        "Content": "Donald Trump has again restated his desire to acquire Greenland for the US \"for purpose of national security\", saying anything less is \"unacceptable\", even as a poll found less than a fifth of Americans support the idea. In a post on Truth Social on Wednesday, the US president said the vast Arctic nation \"is vital for the Golden Dome that we are building\". The Golden Dome project, to build a missile defence shield, was announced by Mr Trump in May. \"IF WE DON'T [take over Greenland], RUSSIA AND CHINA CHINA WILL, AND THAT IS NOT GOING TO HAPPEN!\", he added, warning that NATO would be \"far more formidable and effective\" if Washington took over. It came as Danish and Greenlandic foreign ministers arrived at the White House for a meeting with US vice president JD Vance and secretary of state Marco Rubio. As the meeting was about to take place, Greenland's government announced that Danish armed forces would expand their presence and continue exercises on the world's largest island in close cooperation with NATO allies. In a later post on the social media platform, Mr Trump said Denmark had been warned of China and Russia's \"military goals\" towards Greenland. Greenland, home to about 57,000 people, has been a Danish territory for centuries and Mr Trump's desire for the US to acquire it has provoked concern in Copenhagen and its allies. At a meeting of his cabinet on Wednesday, French President Emmanuel Macron said that if the sovereignty of an ally is affected, the \"knock-on effects would be unprecedented\". Mr Trump's desired land-grab is not backed by the vast majority of Americans, according to an Reuters/Ipsos poll, which found just 17% ‌of them support the idea. Almost half (47%) of those polled disapproved of the plan, while 35% were unsure, the survey published on Wednesday, said. Mr Trump's post did not mention using force, but the US president has not ruled out something that, according to Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen, would mean \"everything stops… including NATO\". Mr Trump has said the US will acquire the nation \"the easy way or the hard way\", an apparent reference to using its miltary power if necessary. The poll found large majorities of Democrats and Republicans against annexing the island by force. Only 4% of Americans - said it would be a \"good idea\", while nearly three-quarters (71%), including nine in 10 Democrats and 60% of Republicans, disagreed.

Mr Trump, whose stated aim is to control the Western Hemisphere, has already shown his willingness to take action in support of his aims by removing the Venezuelan President, Nicolas Maduro, earlier this month. He has said the US will \"run\" the country and its oil firms manage the South American nation's oil industry after ordering the military raid. The Golden Dome system - styled on Israel's Iron Dome - is designed to be able to detect and stop missiles at all points of attack, from before launch to when they are descending towards a target, the Trump administration has said.

The group is expected to meet for the first time \"within a matter of weeks\". \"The group, in our view, should focus on how to address the American security concerns, while at the same time respecting the red lines of the Kingdom of Denmark,\" he said. Meanwhile, Greenland's foreign minister Vivian Motzfeldt said the talks were held in a \"respectful way\" and added it is in their interests to \"find the right path\". Trump: 'Unacceptable' if US doesn't control Greenland The talks came after a Truth Social post from Mr Trump, who said it would be \"unacceptable\" if Greenland is not \"in the hands of the United States\". He claimed the territory was \"vital for the Golden Dome\" - a giant, US version of Israel's missile defence system that experts have dismissed as physically implausible. The US president also urged NATO to tell Denmark to keep China and Russia away from Greenland. Leaders of the European Parliament \"unequivocally\" condemned Mr Trump's statements on Greenland and called on the EU Commission and Council to give concrete and tangible support to Greenland and Denmark. \"We respect the wishes of ‌the Greenlanders ⁠and their interests and ‌they can ‍count on us,\" EU Commission president Ursula von der Leyen said earlier on Wednesday. French President Emmanuel Macron echoed her remarks in a cabinet meeting, telling ministers if the sovereignty of ​a European country ⁠and ally was affected, the ​knock-on ​effects would be unprecedented. \"We do ‌not underestimate ⁠statements on Greenland,\" ‌Mr Macron said of US threats. Bolstering military presence in Arctic Both Denmark and Greenland announced that they would raise their military presence in and around the Arctic territory alongside their allies. Danish defence minister Troels Lund Poulsen confirmed Denmark would have a more permanent presence on Greenland going forward. He described a US attack on the island as being completely hypothetical, saying it was unlikely a NATO nation would attack another NATO country. Sweden's prime minister, Ulf Kristersson, announced a similar move, saying several officers from the Swedish Armed Forces were arriving in Greenland on Wednesday. \"They are part of a group from several allied countries. Together, they will prepare for upcoming elements within the framework of the Danish exercise Operation Arctic Endurance,\" he wrote in an online post.

        "Content": "By James Sillars & Sarah Taaffe-Maguire, business and economics reporters  When South East Water (SEW) is in the news, the headlines do not generally make for comfortable reading. While the water and sewerage industry and its regulators have little to cheer about, this water-only supplier is now facing calls to be nationalised - such is the strength of feeling over performance as it grapples with supply chaos. It comes as 23,000 properties had been affected by supply issues across Kent and Sussex, and a major incident was declared in the two counties. People entered a fifth day without water as Storm Goretti caused power cuts and burst pipes on Friday and Saturday last week. It followed a \"water quality issue\" in December, which meant 24,000 people suffered days without water in Tunbridge Wells. A SEW statement on Wednesday said, \"We are very sorry to all our customers who have been affected. \"We know and understand how difficult going without water for such a long period of time is and how difficult it makes everyday life.\" Here, Sky News will examine what's gone wrong at the Kent and Sussex water supplier over many years and why its leadership team is facing such stringent criticism amid accusations of continued rewards for failure. Who owns South East Water? The company, which is responsible for supplies to 2.3 million homes, has been owned by a consortium of mainly foreign investment and pension funds known as HDF Holdings for nearly 20 years. It has long faced criticism over the payments of dividends to shareholders while grappling with high debts, culminating in a fresh £200m cash injection a year ago to keep SEW afloat pending inflation-busting bill hikes agreed by water regulator Ofwat. The 20% increase in the 2025-30 settlement (which is still subject to appeal by the company) was to allow for greater investment in neglected supply infrastructure. The pension fund of lender NatWest also owns a 25% stake in SEW. When approached by Sky News, the NatWest Group pension fund said: \"We are extremely concerned by the impact these incidents are having on the households, businesses and other users who rely on SEW for water services. \"NatWest group pension fund will use its influence as a minority shareholder to direct SEW's board to ensure these issues are fully resolved.\" Why is SEW not working? A water industry source told Sky News that SEW was not fit for purpose, describing it as \"an enormous failure\". \"The company is not as resilient as it needs to be\", they said. \"It's a tiny company that has been patched together. They don't have the interconnectedness to move water around their network like other companies do. They would point to needing more investment in resilience and their appeal is with the CMA now, but I don't think that's the full picture. You can see this is a failing company.\" Latest financial figures for the company's 2024 to 2025 financial year show it recorded a £19.8m loss before tax, less than the £36.7m loss of a year earlier. Why is SEW's boss facing particular criticism? SEW's chief executive, David Hinton, has come in for direct criticism in recent months from local and national politicians as well as Kent residents. After an appearance before the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (EFRA) Committee of MPs last week, where Mr Hinton again suggested working from home was partly to blame for water supply issues, he and senior leadership have been recalled to give evidence. Mr Hinton suggested the rise in people working from home in the commuter area has added to supply pressure, as he did in 2023, to explain a hosepipe ban. The chair of the EFRA committee announced the recall as he was \"deeply sceptical about the company's version of events to date, and its board's track record of holding the company to account\". Mr Hinton's pay rose last year. His annual bonus increased to £115,231, from £112,560 the year before, while his base salary grew to £307,274 from £294,042. What's the regulator done? Perhaps we should be grateful that SEW does not handle storm drains, given the massive penalties handed out by Ofwat in recent years over sewage spills more widely. We have heard little since 2023 when Ofwat opened an investigation into SEW over the reliability of supply following a string of outages - the worst lasting 23 days. It has long faced criticism over leaks, however, and paid a price. The most recent penalties came in 2023/4 when Ofwat announced an £8m fine for a failure to meet targets. That came on top of a further £3.2m charge for supply disruption. SEW has been contacted for comment."

        "Headline": "Peter Hebblethwaite, whose exit as chief executive of P&O Ferries was confirmed last year, saw his pay drop from £683,000 in 2023, according to company accounts seen by Sky News.",
        "Content": "\n          City editor\n              @MarkKleinmanSky\n The former P&O Ferries chief once described as \"Britain's most hated boss\" saw his pay slide in his final full year in the job - but still earned more than £600,000. Sky News can reveal that Peter Hebblethwaite was paid £622,000 in 2024, down from £683,000 the year before. The figure is contained in accounts for P&O Ferries Division Holdings, which were published by Companies House on Wednesday. Money latest: The problem with supermarket honey In a statement, a spokesperson for P&O Ferries said: \"Our 2024 results show that our transformation is delivering. \"Despite challenges in the freight market and the long-term impact of Brexit on the sector, our financial position has continued to improve, customer satisfaction is rising, and our state-of-the-art hybrid vessels on the Channel are delivering significant reductions in carbon emissions. \"The business is focused on delivering a reliable and market-leading service to our customers and is well-positioned to continue its recovery to sustainable long-term growth.\" \n                  Wind power prices up in new offshore contracts as UK moves away from gas\n                 \n                  South East Water supply crisis is familiar tale for customers\n                 \n                  Bad news for Guinness drinkers; the problem with supermarket honey (and what to look for on label) | Money blog\n                 The company declined to comment on Mr Hebblethwaite's pay package. Sky News revealed last autumn that P&O Ferries had hired former DFDS executive Kasper Moos as his successor. Mr Hebblethwaite's scandal-hit tenure saw him sack hundreds of seafarers and replace them with cheaper agency staff in a move which sparked fury in 2022 and catapulted him into the ranks of Britain's most notorious corporate figures nearly four years ago. P&O Ferries - a subsidiary of the giant Dubai-based ports operator DP World - said it was sacking 800 staff with immediate effect - some of whom learned their fate via a video message. The policy, which Mr Hebblethwaite defended to MPs during subsequent select committee hearings, erupted into a national scandal, prompting changes in the law to give workers greater protection. Mr Hebblethwaite had argued that the company would have gone bust without the drastic cost-cutting that it entailed. P&O Ferries carries 4.5 million passengers annually on routes between the UK and continental European ports, including Calais and Rotterdam. It also operates a route between Northern Ireland and Scotland, and is a major freight carrier. The company's losses soared during the pandemic, with DP World - its sole shareholder - supporting it through hundreds of millions of pounds in loans. Its most recent accounts show a slight escalation in losses in 2024. In October 2024, the then transport secretary, Louise Haigh, said: \"The mass sacking by P&O Ferries was a national scandal which can never be allowed to happen again,\" adding that measures to protect seafarers from \"rogue employers\" would prevent a repetition. The minister's description of P&O Ferries as \"rogue\", and suggestion that consumers should boycott the company, sparked a row which threatened to overshadow the government's International Investment Summit last October. Sky News's business and economics correspondent, Paul Kelso, revealed that DP World had withdrawn from participating in the event, and paused a £1bn investment announcement. The company relented after Sir Keir Starmer publicly distanced the government from Ms Haigh's characterisation of DP World."

        "Content": "MPs have warned that recent and upcoming policies could be the final nail in the coffin for many pubs, as the Commons backed an increase in alcohol duty in line with inflation. Pubs have faced a toxic cocktail in recent years, including an increase in employer's national insurance, the minimum wage, energy costs, business rates, inflation, new worker's rights legislation and now a rise in alcohol duty. The alcohol duty rise will come into play from 1 February, after MPs backed the government's Finance Bill that will enact policies announced in Rachel Reeves's budget. Analysis of government data by tax specialists at Ryan showed that one pub a day closed permanently in England and Wales in 2025. Another 540 pubs are set to close this year, according to new modelling from UKHospitality. That has raised alarm among many, including among Labour figures - and Ms Reeves is working on a package for pubs which could help them with business rates. 'The rural pub is in danger' Despite the alcohol duty rise being backed in the Commons on Tuesday, Labour MPs were among those who voiced concern about the pressures facing pubs. Years of multiple challenges have \"left many venues operating on very low margins, if any at all,\" Jacob Collier, Labour MP for Burton and Uttoxeter said. Gareth Snell, another Labour MP, said one brewer in his area faced a 450% business rate increase and called for a \"realistic, workable solution\" from the government. Liberal Democrat MP Calum Miller many pubs in his Bicester and Woodstock constituency have shut, leaving towns and villages without a \"key institution that brings the community together\". Shadow treasury minister James Wild said the hospitality industry is being \"punished\" by the government, who are \"layering costs upon costs\". The UK's longest serving and oldest MP, Sir Edward Leigh, also raised concerns about government plans to lower the legal limit for drink-driving and what it would mean for rural pubs. He cautioned that \"everybody who accesses these pubs in rural England has to go there by car\", adding: \"The government has to understand that the rural pub is in real danger for these alcohol limits.\" Read more from Sky News:Government U-turns on digital IDBirmingham to Manchester rail line announced Also on Tuesday, mayor of Greater Manchester Andy Burnham, tipped as a future Labour leader, said he wanted a rebalancing of business rates and supported \"relief for the high street and particularly pubs\". Pubs will continue to be hit with rising prices in the meantime, with The Morning Advertiser reporting that the price of various drinks will rise from April. Price hikes from Diageo will see Guinness jump by around 4p a pint - and there's a 13p increase in the list price of a 70cl bottle of Smirnoff Vodka. Price increases will add further pressure this year on a sector that has already seen more than 15,000 pubs close between 2000 and 2024, according to British Beer & Pub Association figures. A new survey shows businesses turned their most pessimistic in three years at the ‌end of 2025 and their mood worsened after Ms Reeves's budget at the end ​of November. The survey, published on Wednesday by The Institute of Chartered Accountants ⁠in England and Wales, revealed confidence dropped from September to December. Treasury minister Lucy Rigby told MPs on Tuesday the government wants pubs to \"thrive\" and would work with the sector on what support is required. She defended the move on alcohol duty, saying continuing the freeze would mainly benefit shops and supermarkets, rather than the hospitality sector."

        "Content": "\n          Scotland reporter\n              @Jenster13\n The Scottish government has unveiled its draft budget for 2026-27 - with a boost to its child payment benefit, changes to income tax and new taxes on expensive homes and private jet travel. Finance Secretary Shona Robison says the SNP administration's spending plans would benefit families and was a budget for a \"more prosperous Scotland\". It comes just four months before the Holyrood election, so some of the pledged changes are dependent on the party retaining power. THE WINNERS Scottish Child Payment The Scottish Child Payment will be increased to £40 per week for families with a child under the age of one. The change is scheduled come into force at the beginning of the 2027-28 year. It is currently £27.15 per week. \n                  Scottish Budget 2026: Finance Secretary Shona Robison unveils SNP government's spending and tax plans\n                 \n                  Scotland's Justice Secretary Angela Constance 'unintentionally' breached ministerial code, investigation finds\n                 \n                  Scotland's first minister John Swinney announces bank holiday to celebrate World Cup\n                 The benefit, which is given to low-income families, will also increase in line with inflation. Ms Robison said: \"The first year of a baby's life is one of the most exciting times for any family, but we know this time can bring extra stress and costs too. \"This support for mums and dads will help them through that critical first year of their child's life, delivering the best start in life for children and for families.\" Breakfast clubs The government has pledged funding to set up breakfast clubs in every primary and additional support needs (ASN) school by August 2027. Ms Robison said it would give parents the opportunity to drop their children off at school earlier, which could open up new shifts at work. She added: \"For some, families saving on the cost of breakfast. For others, the kids getting a breakfast that they wouldn't otherwise receive, fuelling them to learn.\" WINNERS AND LOSERS Income tax A tax cut has been provided to low earners. Thresholds for the basic (20%) and intermediate rates (21%) will increase by 7.4% to £16,537 and £29,526 respectively. This will push some workers into lower tax brackets and keep others from paying more. The rise is expected to cost the government £50m in the coming financial year, according to the Scottish Fiscal Commission, while the decision to continue the freeze for other bands up to 2028-29 will see a £200m boost in that year. The increase to the rates means the Scottish government can continue to claim that the majority of Scots pay less tax than they would elsewhere in the UK, a claim which has been debunked by experts in recent years. Ms Robison later admitted lower earners would not save a \"great deal of tax\" due to the budget. But she said the package of support, including tax and social security, was worth about £480 a year. Meanwhile, in 2025-26 there were 728,000 taxpayers in the higher, advanced and top bands. The Scottish government now expects that to increase to 834,000 in 2026-27. Ms Robison said it would have cost £125m alone to increase the threshold for the 42p higher rate of income tax from its current level of £43,663 to £44,000. In response, the Scottish Conservatives said the SNP was \"clobbering middle-income workers\". MSP Craig Hoy, the Tories' shadow finance secretary, said: \"Tens of thousands more nurses, teachers and police officers on relatively modest salaries are being dragged into the higher rate, which was never intended for them. \"The SNP's vindictive tax on aspiration is stifling Scotland's economic performance by making it harder and harder for businesses to recruit and retain skilled individuals.\" Mr Hoy branded it a \"bad budget for Scotland\". He added: \"If you are earning £43,000 a year and you get a £2,000 pay increase next year, the Scottish government will take £1,000 of that. \"That's not fair, it's not equitable, and that is why the Scottish government is not growing the Scottish economy.\" Read more from Sky News:More than 500 pubs tipped to close this yearOut of a job and on benefits: Why Britain isn't working THE LOSERS Mansion tax Two new council tax bands are to be created by April 2028 for homes worth more than £1m. Band I will be for properties valued between £1m and £2m, while Band J will be for properties valued above £2m. The higher bands seek to \"improve fairness at the top end of the system\" and will be based on up-to-date values for those properties only. The Scottish government's budget document reads: \"This is a targeted change, with fewer than 1% of households affected, and seeks to ensure that those with the broadest shoulders contribute more, by requiring the highest value properties to pay higher charges.\" Ms Robison said the change will \"bring greater fairness, as well as increased revenues to councils\". The wider council tax framework will remain unchanged. Councils are to receive a record allocation of almost £15.7bn to deliver key public services. Ms Robison said the funding to local government had risen by 2% in real terms and urged councils not to make large increases in levies. She said: \"Decisions on council tax rates will, of course, be taken locally. \"However, this is a reasonable deal and given the cost of living pressures that we all recognise, I urge local authorities to translate the settlement into reasonable decisions on council tax.\" Private jet tax and air travel An airport departure tax will be implemented by April 2027, with a consultation on a potential exemption for the Highlands and Islands. The budget document says: \"To provide certainty and stability for industry and taxpayers, we will match the UK government's APD rates and bands for 2027-28. \"Rates and bands for 2028-29 will be set out in the 2027-28 Scottish budget and developed in line with the Scottish government's high-level principles for ADT.\" A tax for private jets is expected to come into force at some point after April next year. Ms Robison said: \"To those who choose to travel by private jet, in Scotland you will pay, and pay a fair share for that privilege, and in doing so you will be helping us make Scotland a fairer nation we all know it can and should be.\""

        "Content": "The home secretary has said she no longer has confidence in the chief constable of West Midlands Police after a \"damning\" report into the force's decision to ban Israeli football fans from attending a game in the UK. Shabana Mahmood told MPs a review by a police watchdog into the force showed \"confirmation bias\" over the decision to ban Maccabi Tel Aviv supporters from attending the match at Villa Park in November. Ms Mahmood also expressed frustration that she was not able to sack Chief Constable Craig Guildford herself. Politics latest - follow live The home secretary does not have the power to hire or fire chief constables as this is now held by elected police and crime commissioners (PCCs) - a role being scrapped by the government. Ms Mahmood said new statutory powers are planned to allow a home secretary to force the resignation of chief constables on the grounds of their performance. West Midlands Police has said it will take \"immediate action\" to rectify problems raised by the police watchdog. \n                  Illegal migrant worker crackdown sees record numbers of raids and arrests \n                 \n                  Asylum hotel migrant evictions set to begin in the spring\n                 \n                  Migrant small boat Channel crossings in 2025 are second highest ever\n                 In a statement, the force said it had \"received a copy of the preliminary review today and acknowledge that this recognises the unintentional nature of our errors. We are extremely sorry for the impact these have had on individuals and their communities\". \"We are taking immediate action to address the matters raised in these preliminary findings. We know that mistakes were made but reiterate the findings that none of this was done with an intent of deliberate distortion or discrimination. \"West Midlands Police is an anti-discriminatory organisation and our planning for this football match was always about public safety of all communities. \"We continue to focus on protecting the public of West Midlands and improving our services, as we have done relentlessly during the last several years. \"We will now work tirelessly to rebuild confidence in West Midlands Police.\" Meanwhile, Simon Foster, the PCC for West Midlands Police, stopped short of firing CC Guildford, saying after Ms Mahmood's statement in the Commons that the watchdog's review must be given \"careful and detailed consideration\". He said he would ask questions of the force's top officer himself at a public meeting of his Accountability and Governance Board on 27 January. \"It is vital that all involved act in accordance with due process and the law at all times,\" he added. What does the report say? Speaking in parliament, Ms Mahmood outlined the key contents of the report, written by Sir Andy Cooke, the Chief Inspector of Constabulary. The cabinet minister said: \"The force, we now discover, conducted little engagement with the Jewish community, and none with the Jewish community in Birmingham before a decision was taken. \"Andy describes an approach taken by West Midlands Police that he characterises as, and I quote, 'confirmation bias'. \"This means that rather than follow the evidence, the force sought only the evidence to support their desired position to ban the fans.\" She said the force failed to speak to police forces in other countries such as Greece, Ukraine and Denmark \"where Maccabi Tel Aviv had played more recently and more peacefully\". Ms Mahmood called the force's communications with the Dutch police \"one of the most disquieting elements\" of the report. She said: \"The summary, provided as evidence to the Safety Advisory Group ahead of their crucial meeting on the 24 October, was inaccurate. \"Claims including the number of police officers deployed, links between fans and the Israeli Defence Forces, the targeting of Muslim communities, the mass tearing down of Palestinian flags, attacks on police officers and on taxi drivers were all either exaggerated or simply untrue.\" Sir Andy's report also highlighted issues about poor-record keeping and mishandling of sensitive information by the force. \"He shows that the police overstated the threat posed by the Maccabi Tel Aviv fans, while understating the risk that was posed to the Israeli fans if they travelled to the area,\" she added. Turning to the issue of the chief constable directly, she accused him of \"misleading communications\" and a \"failure of leadership\", saying this is why she no longer has confidence in him. But in a letter by Sir Andy to Ms Mahmood, he wrote that he found \"no evidence\" of antisemitism being the reason why the police force banned fans of the team from attending the match. What happens now? In a statement responding to the report, West Midlands Police said it is \"extremely sorry\" for making mistakes and said it is taking \"immediate action to address the matters raised\". But the force defended itself, saying that \"none of this was done with an intent of deliberate distortion or discrimination\" and that it \"was always about public safety of all communities\". Meanwhile in Parliament, shadow home secretary Chris Philp said Mr Guildford \"must be fired\", and accused Ms Mahmood of \"pretending to have no power\". Despite the findings of Sir Andy, he said: \"This is a shameful episode. West Midlands police had evidence that Islamist extremists based in Birmingham planned to attack Maccabi Tel Aviv fans. Let us call that what it is: vicious antisemitism. \"We cannot allow violent Islamists to impose their will on our country, yet that is exactly what West Midlands police, through weakness and fear, allowed to happen.\" But the home secretary hit back that it was the Conservatives who scrapped her ability to fire chief constables in 2011. John Cotton, a Labour politician and leader of Birmingham City Council, has said Mr Guildford \"should stand down\" as \"confidence needs to be restored in the leadership of West Midlands Police\". Ayoub Khan, the area's local MP who campaigned for the ban originally, has said Mr Guildford is \"being thrown under a bus\" and called it a \"witch hunt\". The Police Federation is supportive of the government's plan to return the power to sack chief constables back to the home secretary, Sky News understands. The body, which represents police officers in England and Wales, believes doing so could improve fairness. Top cop apologised for providing 'erroneous' evidence Earlier on Wednesday, CC Guildford apologised to MPs for giving them \"erroneous\" evidence about the decision to ban Maccabi fans, blaming the use of AI. The police force announced in October that supporters of Maccabi Tel Aviv would not be able to attend the club's match against Aston Villa in Birmingham the following month, because it had classified the fixture as high risk based on \"current intelligence and previous incidents\", without saying where the threat came from. That decision led to an outcry, with Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer expressing concern, and senior members of West Midlands Police made to appear twice before MPs to answer questions about the ban. The House of Commons Home Affairs Select Committee heard evidence from CC Guildford, as well as others, which led to the Board of Deputies of British Jews and the Jewish Leadership Council jointly calling for him to go."

        "Content": "\n          Chief political correspondent\n              @joncraig\n It's one of the oldest and corniest of all political jokes. And there were groans as well as laughs when Kama Sutra Keir taunted Kemi Badenoch with it in the Commons. Mocking the Tories for changing prime ministers and other top posts, the PM declared in an attempt at raunchy humour: \"They had more positions in 14 years than the Kama Sutra.\" For those who don't know, the Kama Sutra is an ancient Hindu guide on sex positions, the art of love and spirituality. Erotic, its supporters claim. Smutty, according to prudes. But if Sir Keir turning the air blue sounded familiar, that's because it is. It's a dreadful joke that's been cracked 33 times by senior politicians in parliament in recent years, according to Hansard. It's been used by the Conservatives against Sir Keir himself, by former Tory leaders Sir Iain Duncan Smith and William Hague against Tony Blair and by ex-deputy PM Sir Nick Clegg against his Tory coalition partner George Osborne. Most recently, it was used last July by then-Commons leader Lucy Powell, now Labour's deputy leader, against her Tory shadow, the posh Etonian Jesse Norman. In a virtually identical taunt about Tory U-turns to that employed by Sir Keir to Mrs Badenoch, Ms Powell said: \"In 14 years they have had more positions than the Kama Sutra.\" \n                  MPs would vote on deployment of troops to Ukraine, Starmer says\n                 \n                  Sir Keir Starmer says he 'never authorised attacks' on Wes Streeting after coup claims\n                 \n                  Starmer says former Tory ministers have 'serious questions to answer' over Afghan data breach\n                 But in 2021, Tory chair Amanda Milling mocked Sir Keir: \"He points different ways depending on which day it is, changing position more often than the Kama Sutra to chase headlines and play politics.\" A year earlier, in the 2020 Commons Brexit wars, Remainer Tom Tugendhat told MPs wearily: \"After years of acrimony and anger, it is time to end the constitutional Kama Sutra.\" In 2013, when he was a coalition minister, Sir Vince Cable mocked Labour's Ed Balls, telling MPs: \"The shadow chancellor has had more positions on the economy than there are positions in the Kama Sutra.\" Back in 2008, before they sat in David Cameron's cabinet together, Clegg used the jibe against Osborne about the Northern Rock banking crisis in his Lib Dem conference speech, claiming: \"George Osborne has had more positions than the Kama Sutra.\" Read more:Every Labour U-turn after Starmer rows back on digital ID planUK 'won't back down' in row with X over Grok sex images, PM says In 2005, by then no longer Tory leader, IDS goaded Blair at PMQs: \"The prime minister has been against Europe and then for it. He has been for the pound and then against it. He has been against a referendum and then for it. \"The prime minister has taken more positions than the Kama Sutra.\" Later on the same day, Hague, his predecessor as Tory leader, followed up: \"I believe the prime minister is now on his seventh policy in 18 months on the question of holding a referendum on the European constitution. \"(He) compared it at Prime Minister's Questions to the Kama Sutra, but even with all the prime minister's skills of ambiguity, his endemic contortions and U-turns, he is not quite in that category.\" Other current MPs who have recited the gag in parliament include Labour's Peter Dowd and Tory George Freeman. Peers include the distinguished lawyers Lords Pannick and Lester of Herne Hill. It's such an old joke, and it divides opinion. Some reports claimed the attempt by Kama Sutra Keir at bawdy humour had MPs in hysterics. Others claimed it flopped. They do say that when it comes to jokes, the old ones are the best. Not the Kama Sutra joke, however."

Politics Live: Elon Musk is complying with UK law in relation to Grok image abuse He added that X's decision to turn its AI image editing tool into a premium service was \"horrific\" and ministers are \"absolutely determined to take action\". Responding to a question from Labour MP Emily Darlington, Sir Keir said: \"I have been informed this morning that X is acting to ensure full compliance with UK law. \"If so, that is welcome, but we're not going to back down, and they must act. \"We will take the necessary measures.

When asked to generate images, it will refuse to produce anything illegal, as the operating principle for Grok is to obey the laws of any given country or state. \"There may be times when adversarial hacking of Grok prompts does something unexpected. If that happens, we fix the bug immediately.\" In a second post, he wrote: \"History will not be kind to Starmer.\" He was sharing a post by Reform's head of policy Zia Yusuf that said the PM was \"now coming after your end-to-end encrypted messaging apps like Whatsapp and iMessage\". Ofcom, the media regulator, launched an investigation into X on Monday following mounting concerns over reports Grok was allowing users to manipulate images of women and children to sexualise them. Technology Secretary Liz Kendall said the watchdog would have ministers' full support to take action against X, including effectively banning the platform in the UK, if the company did not make changes. She condemned the platform's decision to limit some use of Grok's image generating function to X's paying subscribers, saying the platform was \"monetising abuse\". And Ms Kendall said legislation making it a criminal offence to create or request the creation of non-consensual intimate images would come into force this week following the Grok outcry. Mr Musk, the site's billionaire owner, had initially claimed the threats were part of an effort to censor X. Sir Keir also called it “astonishing” that Reform UK defended Mr Musk on the issue. \"I said the images are disgusting, their position is disgusting on this. This is weaponising images of women and children that should never be made.\" Reform UK's leader Nigel Farage has called the images being produced by Grok \"horrible in every way\" but said that banning X would infringe on free speech. Ofcom's powers fall under the Online Safety Act, which states that online platforms have to make sure they're not hosting illegal content. If X is found to not comply with the Online Safety Act, Ofcom can issue a fine of up to 10% of its worldwide revenue or £18m, and if that is not enough, can go as far as getting a court approval to block the site."

        "Content": "\n          news reporter\n       Ten British \"far-right activists\" have been banned from France for \"reconnaissance and destruction activities\" against small boats used in migrant crossings. The country's interior ministry said in a statement that the individuals were identified as part of the Raise the Colours movement. Raise the Colours told Sky News it has not received formal notification of the bans, and said it \"has always maintained that its activities must remain peaceful and within the law\". The French ministry said the 10 \"engaged, in particular, in reconnaissance and destruction activities targeting small boats, as well as in propaganda activities along the French coastline\". It said those banned on Tuesday were \"far-right activists\" who took part in operations in the Nord and Pas-de-Calais areas in December. The 10, which have not been named, are now prohibited from entering and staying in France. \"These actions were aimed at a British audience, calling on them to bolster the ranks of the movement in order to put an end to migration,\" the ministry added. Videos posted by Raise the Colours on X in December, seen by Sky News, show some members of the group saying they are in France to stop small boats used by migrants from illegally crossing the English Channel. One video, posted on 5 December, shows an inflatable small boat destroyed, with the caption: \"Some people say 'Stop The Boats' we actually STOP THE BOATS.\" Sky News could not verify the location of that post. Other posts by the account, under what it calls Operation Overload, suggest the videos online are filmed in France. The group came to prominence last summer as part of a collective movement to display the Union Flag and St George's flag - which do not often appear outside sporting, royal or military events - across the country. According to its website, Raise the Colours is a \"lawful, civic movement\", but added \"individuals connected to our movement have filmed and recorded events in northern France in order to uncover and expose what is happening around illegal Channel crossings\". It says it does \"not encourage, endorse or support anyone travelling to France, approaching migrant vessels, or attempting to intervene in crossings\". \"Any individual choosing to travel abroad or take physical action does so entirely on their own initiative and without our support, approval or encouragement,\" it added. In a statement to Sky News about the bans, Raise the Colours said: \"At the time of issuing this statement, no formal notification has been received by Raise the Colours regarding any administrative measures.\" Read more from Sky News:Small boat crossings in 2025 second highest everPower to seize phones comes into force The group said it understands \"the statements refer to administrative decisions concerning specific individuals, rather than the organisation as a whole,\" and added that \"any official correspondence will be reviewed if and when it is received through the appropriate channels\". It then reiterated that Raise the Colours \"has always maintained that its activities must remain peaceful and within the law\" and it \"does not support violence or any unlawful activity\" - citing a \"structured recruitment and screening process we have put in place\". \"We respect the authority of national governments to maintain public order and will continue to act responsibly and diligently moving forward in our endeavours to stop the illegal invasion of our country.\" Sky News has contacted the Home Office for comment."

        "Content": "MPs have warned that recent and upcoming policies could be the final nail in the coffin for many pubs, as the Commons backed an increase in alcohol duty in line with inflation. Pubs have faced a toxic cocktail in recent years, including an increase in employer's national insurance, the minimum wage, energy costs, business rates, inflation, new worker's rights legislation and now a rise in alcohol duty. The alcohol duty rise will come into play from 1 February, after MPs backed the government's Finance Bill that will enact policies announced in Rachel Reeves's budget. Analysis of government data by tax specialists at Ryan showed that one pub a day closed permanently in England and Wales in 2025. Another 540 pubs are set to close this year, according to new modelling from UKHospitality. That has raised alarm among many, including among Labour figures - and Ms Reeves is working on a package for pubs which could help them with business rates. 'The rural pub is in danger' Despite the alcohol duty rise being backed in the Commons on Tuesday, Labour MPs were among those who voiced concern about the pressures facing pubs. Years of multiple challenges have \"left many venues operating on very low margins, if any at all,\" Jacob Collier, Labour MP for Burton and Uttoxeter said. Gareth Snell, another Labour MP, said one brewer in his area faced a 450% business rate increase and called for a \"realistic, workable solution\" from the government. Liberal Democrat MP Calum Miller many pubs in his Bicester and Woodstock constituency have shut, leaving towns and villages without a \"key institution that brings the community together\". Shadow treasury minister James Wild said the hospitality industry is being \"punished\" by the government, who are \"layering costs upon costs\". The UK's longest serving and oldest MP, Sir Edward Leigh, also raised concerns about government plans to lower the legal limit for drink-driving and what it would mean for rural pubs. He cautioned that \"everybody who accesses these pubs in rural England has to go there by car\", adding: \"The government has to understand that the rural pub is in real danger for these alcohol limits.\" Read more from Sky News:Government U-turns on digital IDBirmingham to Manchester rail line announced Also on Tuesday, mayor of Greater Manchester Andy Burnham, tipped as a future Labour leader, said he wanted a rebalancing of business rates and supported \"relief for the high street and particularly pubs\". Pubs will continue to be hit with rising prices in the meantime, with The Morning Advertiser reporting that the price of various drinks will rise from April. Price hikes from Diageo will see Guinness jump by around 4p a pint - and there's a 13p increase in the list price of a 70cl bottle of Smirnoff Vodka. Price increases will add further pressure this year on a sector that has already seen more than 15,000 pubs close between 2000 and 2024, according to British Beer & Pub Association figures. A new survey shows businesses turned their most pessimistic in three years at the ‌end of 2025 and their mood worsened after Ms Reeves's budget at the end ​of November. The survey, published on Wednesday by The Institute of Chartered Accountants ⁠in England and Wales, revealed confidence dropped from September to December. Treasury minister Lucy Rigby told MPs on Tuesday the government wants pubs to \"thrive\" and would work with the sector on what support is required. She defended the move on alcohol duty, saying continuing the freeze would mainly benefit shops and supermarkets, rather than the hospitality sector."

        "Content": "\n          Scotland reporter\n              @Jenster13\n The Scottish government has unveiled its draft budget for 2026-27 - with a boost to its child payment benefit, changes to income tax and new taxes on expensive homes and private jet travel. Finance Secretary Shona Robison says the SNP administration's spending plans would benefit families and was a budget for a \"more prosperous Scotland\". It comes just four months before the Holyrood election, so some of the pledged changes are dependent on the party retaining power. THE WINNERS Scottish Child Payment The Scottish Child Payment will be increased to £40 per week for families with a child under the age of one. The change is scheduled come into force at the beginning of the 2027-28 year. It is currently £27.15 per week. \n                  Scottish Budget 2026: Finance Secretary Shona Robison unveils SNP government's spending and tax plans\n                 \n                  Scotland's Justice Secretary Angela Constance 'unintentionally' breached ministerial code, investigation finds\n                 \n                  Scotland's first minister John Swinney announces bank holiday to celebrate World Cup\n                 The benefit, which is given to low-income families, will also increase in line with inflation. Ms Robison said: \"The first year of a baby's life is one of the most exciting times for any family, but we know this time can bring extra stress and costs too. \"This support for mums and dads will help them through that critical first year of their child's life, delivering the best start in life for children and for families.\" Breakfast clubs The government has pledged funding to set up breakfast clubs in every primary and additional support needs (ASN) school by August 2027. Ms Robison said it would give parents the opportunity to drop their children off at school earlier, which could open up new shifts at work. She added: \"For some, families saving on the cost of breakfast. For others, the kids getting a breakfast that they wouldn't otherwise receive, fuelling them to learn.\" WINNERS AND LOSERS Income tax A tax cut has been provided to low earners. Thresholds for the basic (20%) and intermediate rates (21%) will increase by 7.4% to £16,537 and £29,526 respectively. This will push some workers into lower tax brackets and keep others from paying more. The rise is expected to cost the government £50m in the coming financial year, according to the Scottish Fiscal Commission, while the decision to continue the freeze for other bands up to 2028-29 will see a £200m boost in that year. The increase to the rates means the Scottish government can continue to claim that the majority of Scots pay less tax than they would elsewhere in the UK, a claim which has been debunked by experts in recent years. Ms Robison later admitted lower earners would not save a \"great deal of tax\" due to the budget. But she said the package of support, including tax and social security, was worth about £480 a year. Meanwhile, in 2025-26 there were 728,000 taxpayers in the higher, advanced and top bands. The Scottish government now expects that to increase to 834,000 in 2026-27. Ms Robison said it would have cost £125m alone to increase the threshold for the 42p higher rate of income tax from its current level of £43,663 to £44,000. In response, the Scottish Conservatives said the SNP was \"clobbering middle-income workers\". MSP Craig Hoy, the Tories' shadow finance secretary, said: \"Tens of thousands more nurses, teachers and police officers on relatively modest salaries are being dragged into the higher rate, which was never intended for them. \"The SNP's vindictive tax on aspiration is stifling Scotland's economic performance by making it harder and harder for businesses to recruit and retain skilled individuals.\" Mr Hoy branded it a \"bad budget for Scotland\". He added: \"If you are earning £43,000 a year and you get a £2,000 pay increase next year, the Scottish government will take £1,000 of that. \"That's not fair, it's not equitable, and that is why the Scottish government is not growing the Scottish economy.\" Read more from Sky News:More than 500 pubs tipped to close this yearOut of a job and on benefits: Why Britain isn't working THE LOSERS Mansion tax Two new council tax bands are to be created by April 2028 for homes worth more than £1m. Band I will be for properties valued between £1m and £2m, while Band J will be for properties valued above £2m. The higher bands seek to \"improve fairness at the top end of the system\" and will be based on up-to-date values for those properties only. The Scottish government's budget document reads: \"This is a targeted change, with fewer than 1% of households affected, and seeks to ensure that those with the broadest shoulders contribute more, by requiring the highest value properties to pay higher charges.\" Ms Robison said the change will \"bring greater fairness, as well as increased revenues to councils\". The wider council tax framework will remain unchanged. Councils are to receive a record allocation of almost £15.7bn to deliver key public services. Ms Robison said the funding to local government had risen by 2% in real terms and urged councils not to make large increases in levies. She said: \"Decisions on council tax rates will, of course, be taken locally. \"However, this is a reasonable deal and given the cost of living pressures that we all recognise, I urge local authorities to translate the settlement into reasonable decisions on council tax.\" Private jet tax and air travel An airport departure tax will be implemented by April 2027, with a consultation on a potential exemption for the Highlands and Islands. The budget document says: \"To provide certainty and stability for industry and taxpayers, we will match the UK government's APD rates and bands for 2027-28. \"Rates and bands for 2028-29 will be set out in the 2027-28 Scottish budget and developed in line with the Scottish government's high-level principles for ADT.\" A tax for private jets is expected to come into force at some point after April next year. Ms Robison said: \"To those who choose to travel by private jet, in Scotland you will pay, and pay a fair share for that privilege, and in doing so you will be helping us make Scotland a fairer nation we all know it can and should be.\""

        "Content": "Four astronauts are buckling up for an unexpected return from the International Space Station (ISS) after one of them suffered a \"serious medical condition\".  It's the first time in its 25-year history that a mission is being cut short due to such an incident. NASA will not say which of the four astronauts is affected due to confidentiality, nor will it state what the problem is. The person's condition is said to be stable and the space agency's medical chief, Dr. James Polk, said last week they were \"erring on the side of caution\". The crew in the Dragon Endeavour spacecraft undocked just after 10.20pm UK time and drifted away from the space station. Splashdown off California is being targeted for 8.41am on Thursday, according to an ISS post on X. The crew is made up of Americans Mike Fincke and Zena Cardman, Russian Oleg Platonov and Japanese astronaut Kimiya Yui. They arrived at the ISS via a Space X mission in August and were intending on staying for at least six months. Sky News science correspondent Thomas Moore says up to now, ISS astronauts, backed by a flight surgeon and other medics on the ground, have been able to deal with all medical incidents. These have included a blood clot in the jugular vein of an unnamed astronaut a few years ago. The ISS has more than 190 drugs on board as well as medical equipment, including an ultra-sound machine, defibrillator and an intravenous therapy kit. The emergency means the first planned spacewalk of 2026 has been cancelled. Cardman and Fincke were planning to venture outside to make preparations for some new solar panels. \"I'm proud of the swift effort across the agency thus far to ensure the safety of our astronauts,\" said NASA boss Jared Isaacman.

They arrived in November and are not due home until the summer. NASA is planning on taking the 400-tonne space station - which circles the Earth at around 17,500mph - out of orbit in late 2030 or early 2031. The structure will be brought down in the ocean, and the vision is for privately-funded space stations to fill the gap."

        "Content": "Elon Musk's X is acting to comply with UK safety laws and the government \"won't back down\", Sir Keir Starmer has said.  The prime minister told PMQs that the nonconsensual sex images produced by the platform's Grok AI tool are \"disgusting\" and \"shameful\" . Politics Live: Elon Musk is complying with UK law in relation to Grok image abuse He added that X's decision to turn its AI image editing tool into a premium service was \"horrific\" and ministers are \"absolutely determined to take action\". Responding to a question from Labour MP Emily Darlington, Sir Keir said: \"I have been informed this morning that X is acting to ensure full compliance with UK law. \"If so, that is welcome, but we're not going to back down, and they must act. \"We will take the necessary measures. We will strengthen existing laws and prepare for legislation if it needs to go further, and Ofcom will continue its independent investigation.\" Read more: Everything you need to know about Grok controversy After the prime minister's comments, Mr Musk wrote on X: \"I not aware of any naked underage images generated by Grok. Literally zero. \"Obviously, Grok does not spontaneously generate images, it does so only according to user requests. When asked to generate images, it will refuse to produce anything illegal, as the operating principle for Grok is to obey the laws of any given country or state. \"There may be times when adversarial hacking of Grok prompts does something unexpected. If that happens, we fix the bug immediately.\" In a second post, he wrote: \"History will not be kind to Starmer.\" He was sharing a post by Reform's head of policy Zia Yusuf that said the PM was \"now coming after your end-to-end encrypted messaging apps like Whatsapp and iMessage\". Ofcom, the media regulator, launched an investigation into X on Monday following mounting concerns over reports Grok was allowing users to manipulate images of women and children to sexualise them. Technology Secretary Liz Kendall said the watchdog would have ministers' full support to take action against X, including effectively banning the platform in the UK, if the company did not make changes. She condemned the platform's decision to limit some use of Grok's image generating function to X's paying subscribers, saying the platform was \"monetising abuse\". And Ms Kendall said legislation making it a criminal offence to create or request the creation of non-consensual intimate images would come into force this week following the Grok outcry. Mr Musk, the site's billionaire owner, had initially claimed the threats were part of an effort to censor X. Sir Keir also called it “astonishing” that Reform UK defended Mr Musk on the issue. \"I said the images are disgusting, their position is disgusting on this. This is weaponising images of women and children that should never be made.\" Reform UK's leader Nigel Farage has called the images being produced by Grok \"horrible in every way\" but said that banning X would infringe on free speech. Ofcom's powers fall under the Online Safety Act, which states that online platforms have to make sure they're not hosting illegal content. If X is found to not comply with the Online Safety Act, Ofcom can issue a fine of up to 10% of its worldwide revenue or £18m, and if that is not enough, can go as far as getting a court approval to block the site."

        "Content": "\n          Climate reporter\n              @SeabrookClimate\n Planet Earth has just lived through its third-warmest year on record, EU scientists said on Wednesday. Last year was also the hottest on record for Antarctica, another alarm bell that climate change is even catching up with the remote, ice-covered continent that for decades appeared sheltered from it. Read more: Why Antarctica could hold key to our future For the planet as a whole, 2025 came in as the third-hottest on records going back to 1940, according to new data from the European Centre ⁠for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF). Although the world has experienced other hot periods many thousands of years ago, the danger now is how quickly it is warming, making it hard for people and nature to adapt. Last year's heat made extreme weather more dangerous, including the intensity of Hurricane Melissa in the Caribbean and monsoon rains in Pakistan that killed more than 1,000 people. It also drove \"nationally significant\" water problems in the UK during its record hot summer. \n                  Trailer released for King Charles documentary on harmony with nature\n                 \n                  Why there's no escape from Delhi's biggest killer\n                 \n                  2025 on track to be UK's warmest year on record, says Met Office\n                 How hot was 2025? In 2025, average temperatures on Earth's surface clocked in at 1.47C - higher than levels 150 years ago - following 1.6C in 2024, the warmest on record, and 2023 in second place. The unprecedented heat of those past three years inched the world closer to a point it has been trying to avoid. Under the landmark Paris Agreement, from 2015, governments agreed to try to limit global warming to ideally 1.5C above levels before humans started burning fossil fuels at scale. That's because climate impacts beyond that point become more dangerous, costly and disruptive - and some will be irreversible. But temperatures across the past three-year period averaged 1.5C. While such heat would have to last for five years before it is classed as a long-term trend, scientists now think that could happen as soon as 2030 - a decade earlier than had been predicted when the Paris treaty was ‍signed. Samantha Burgess, strategic lead for climate at ECMWF, said: \"1.5C is not a cliff edge. However, we know that every fraction of a degree matters, particularly for worsening ‌extreme weather events.\" Why was 2025 so hot? Two main causes have been blamed for the heat of the past three years. The periodic El Nino weather pattern, which pumps out heat from the Pacific Ocean, added to heat in 2023 and 2024. But it had subsided by 2025, revealing the persistent, long-term warming trend driven by human-made climate change, scientists said. Helen Clarkson, chief executive of the Climate Group, said we are now \"witnessing human-driven warming in real time\". She added: \"Energy and food security, the ability to insure our homes, economic productivity, it's all at risk.\" Political pushback Just as climate impacts worsen, efforts and science to tackle it are being strained. In the UK, the long-standing political consensus on zeroing out emissions - known as net zero - collapsed last year. Meanwhile President Donald Trump is pulling the United States out of scores of climate initiatives, including the Paris Agreement and UN science body the IPCC. This retreat of the world's biggest economy is straining efforts by other countries to reign in climate change, such as last year's COP30 climate summit and proposals to add a green tax to shipping. But it has not sparked a widespread collapse of climate action that some feared, with most countries maintaining their climate targets - albeit with delivery scientists warn is far too slow. Bob Ward, of London's Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment, said: \"Temperatures will continue to rise until the world reaches net zero emissions of greenhouse gases by making the transition away from fossil fuels.\""

        "Content": "Sting has paid £595,000 to his former The Police bandmates since facing legal action over unpaid royalties, the High Court has heard. Drummer Stewart Copeland and guitarist Andrew Summers contend they are owed more than $2m (£1.49m) in \"arranger's fees\" by bassist Sting and his company Magnetic Publishing. Their barrister claimed that arranger's fees - an arrangement where a songwriter would give 15% of publishing income to the other two bandmates - had not been paid from money generated through streaming, according to court documents filed in December 2024. Their case hinges on the interpretation of various agreements made between the band's formation in the late 1970s and 2016. But Robert Howe KC, for Sting, said in written submissions for a preliminary hearing at the High Court on Wednesday that the arrangement does not apply to streaming and should only apply to physical products such as vinyl and cassettes. He also said Sting, whose real name is Gordon Sumner, has paid more than $800,000 (£595,000) in \"certain admitted historic underpayments\" since legal action was launched in late 2024. Mr Howe explained that the musicians couldn't agree on how the phrases \"mechanical income\" and \"public performance fees\" apply to streaming, which continues to generate significant income. The barrister highlighted a \"professionally drafted\" agreement in 2016, which he said states that Sting and his publishing company only owe money on mechanical income \"from the manufacture of records\". Meanwhile, Ian Mill KC, representing Mr Copeland and Mr Summers and their companies, Megalo Music, Kent Foundation Laboratories and Kinetic Kollections, said the agreements go back to 1977. He added that the band - with hits including Every Breath You Take, Roxanne and Message In A Bottle - agreed on the 15% figure before formalising it in written contracts later. In the upcoming trial, the issue to be determined was \"whether the parties have accounted to each other for arranger's fees correctly in accordance with the terms of the 2016 settlement agreement\", Mr Mill said. Read more from Sky News:Actor Kiefer Sutherland arrestedK-pop stars reveal comeback tour In the court documents Mr Mills filed in 2024, Mr Mills said Mr Copeland and Mr Summers believe the 2016 agreement means they are entitled to a share of money \"from all publishing income derived from all manner of commercial exploitation\". The preliminary hearing is set to conclude on Thursday, with the trial expected at a later date."
