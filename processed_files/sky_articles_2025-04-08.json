        "Content": "Donald Trump's trade tariffs on what he calls \"the worst offenders\" come into effect at 5am UK time, with China facing by far the biggest levy. The US will hit Chinese imports with 104% tariffs, marking a significant trade escalation between the world's two largest superpowers. At a briefing on Tuesday, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said Donald Trump \"believes that China wants to make a deal with the US,\" before saying: \"It was a mistake for China to retaliate. \"When America is punched, he punches back harder.\"  After Mr Trump announced sweeping levies last week - hitting some imported goods from China with 34% tariffs - Beijing officials responded with like-for-like measures. The US president then piled on an extra 50% levy on China, taking the total to 104% unless it withdrew its retaliatory 34% tariff. China's commerce ministry said in turn that it would \"fight to the end\", and its foreign ministry accused the US of \"economic bullying\" and \"destabilising\" the world's economies. \n                  What we learn from video of captured Chinese national in Ukraine - and the serious questions it raises\n                 \n                  What China could do next as Trump's tariff war ramps up\n                 \n                  Asian markets rally as China vows to 'fight to the end' over Trump's new tariff threat\n                 'Worst offender' tariffs also in effect Alongside China's 104% tariff, roughly 60 countries - dubbed by the US president as the \"worst offenders\" - will also see levies come into effect today. The EU will be hit with 20% tariffs, while countries like Vietnam and Cambodia see a 46% levy and 49% rate respectively. The UK was not included on this list, and instead saw a \"baseline\", worldwide 10% tariff on imported goods in effect from last Saturday. At the weekend, Sir Keir Starmer promised the government was ready to \"shelter British businesses from the storm\".  Since the tariffs were announced last Wednesday, global stock markets have plummeted, with four days of steep losses for all three of the US' major indexes. As trading closed on Tuesday evening, the S&P 500 lost 1.49%, the Nasdaq Composite fell 2.15%, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 0.84%. According to LSEG data, S&P 500 companies have lost $5.8tn (£4.5tn) in stock market value since last Wednesday, the deepest four-day loss since the benchmark was created in the 1950s.

        "Content": "By Steph Oliver, news editor, and Katerina Vittozzi, news correspondent   London schools are at risk of \"increased violence\" and \"gang exploitation\" following the decision to remove specialist police officers, headteachers have told Sky News. Education leaders are \"urging\" the Metropolitan Police to reconsider a decision to transfer 371 safer schools officers into neighbourhood policing teams next month. Teachers warn pupils will be at \"greater risk\" of violence as a result - and some students told Sky News they were worried \"more knives\" and \"more drugs\" would be brought into schools. Safer schools officers were introduced into London schools in 2009, where they help de-escalate peer-on-peer conflict and prevent youth involvement in crime. In a letter obtained by Sky News, a group of 15 headteachers from secondary schools in northeast London have written to the Met Police warning that \"without the support of safer school officers, vulnerable students may become prey to exploitation and, in turn, perpetrators of crime\". Sam Jones, chair of The Waltham Forest Secondary Heads group, which wrote the letter, said teachers were \"extremely concerned\" about the withdrawal of safer school officers and they had not been consulted about the decision. Mr Jones told Sky News that the decision was \"very misguided\". \"We think that it will increase in violence, potentially increase bullying and weapons-related incidents,\" he said. Safer schools officers are a \"key deterrent when it comes to gang recruitment and county lines issues,\" he added. \"I think this is a huge backward step.\" Knife crime hit a record high of 16,521 offences in London in the year ending September 2024 - an 18% increase from the previous year, according to the Office for National Statistics. A Sky News survey of secondary school teachers in England revealed almost one in five had seen pupils with knives in schools. Students from Footsteps Trust in London said the removal of officers could make schools more violent. \"There will be more knives,\" Tyrelle, 14, told Sky News. \"There will be fighting, there will be drugs coming into school and no one will be there to actually stop it.\" \"If anything happens outside of school you can tell them [the safer school officer] and let them know,\" he added. Another pupil, Mikolej, 15, said having an officer in their school had been a \"good thing\" that had helped young people \"speak more to police officers outside of school\". Chris Hall, headteacher of Footsteps Trust, told Sky News it was \"quite staggering\" that no one in education was consulted about the decision. He said the school-based officers had been \"very, very, valuable assets\" who had helped familiarise \"young people with the police in the most positive way\". \"I would 100% ask them [the Met] to re-consider,\" Mr Hall said. Walthamstow MP Stella Creasy echoed calls for the police force to think again, telling Sky News she hoped the force would \"sit down with all of us so that we can work together on this\". In a letter to headteachers, the Met said the changes will come into effect from 2 May and that the decision was \"not made lightly\". The force said the changes aimed to improve their presence in the community.

        "Content": "By Ali Fortescue, political correspondent, and Hannah Woodward, political news editor   It is \"difficult\" to give a \"cast iron guarantee\" that lives won't be lost because of a coal tip disaster, the deputy first minister of Wales has told Sky News.   Nearly 60 years since the Aberfan disaster, which killed 144 people when coal waste slid down the side of a mountain into a school, £130m has been invested in securing waste left behind by coal mining operations. Earlier this year, the Welsh government said up to £600m could be needed to secure coal tips across the nation. Politics latest: Follow live updates Olivia White, who lives beneath a disused coal heap in Cwmtillery that has been deemed a potential risk to public safety, says she is living with \"horrific fear every day, waking up thinking we're lucky we're here again today\". Ms White's home was one of around 40 evacuated when part of the coal tip collapsed last year. She says she will never forget opening the door and \"thick, dirty sludge pouring through\". She warned: \"I think it is going to take somebody to die or something awful to happen until they realise how serious this is. That's what it feels like. Aberfan just lingers over me all the time\". \n                  Politics latest: Trump tariffs had a 'massive impact', says minister - as Starmer brands situation 'very challenging'\n                 \n                  Chancellor to hold tariff crisis talks with top City executives\n                 \n                  Labour MPs back Corbyn calls for Chilcot-style inquiry into UK's role in Gaza war\n                 Her neighbour, Zara Cotterell, says it was \"very lucky\" that children weren't playing outside at that time. She says: \"It was 7.30pm, if it was 5.30pm the street above would have had all the children playing; it took a car, it took a garage, it would have taken lives.\" Work is under way to secure the tip at Cwmtillery, which could collapse again, but both women say they feel \"no one is listening\" to them. There are 2,573 disused coal tips across Wales, 360 of which are categorised as having a potential impact on public safety. Deputy First Minister Huw Irranca-Davies says he can give people an \"absolute guarantee\" that no expense is being spared to fix the problem. However, he said it is \"pretty difficult\" to give a \"cast iron guarantee\" that people are safe. \"It's an almost impossible question,\" he said. Mr Irranca-Davies said the Welsh government has spent the last five years assessing which tips are the most high risk and work is starting to secure them. He added that the £600m figure is a long-term goal to totally clear the tips, not all of which are high risk. In the autumn budget, the UK government provided the Welsh government with £25m for essential work on disused coal tips. The Welsh finance minister Mark Drakeford is seeking a £91m commitment over three years from Westminster. Mr Irranca-Davies says it is \"great\" that \"after years of asking\" there has been a contribution from the UK government. Wales Secretary Jo Stevens says she wants people to feel reassured that coal tips are being inspected regularly and the \"significant sum of money\" given in the autumn budget will deal with the risks. Plaid Cymru says the £25m from Westminster falls short of what should be paid, adding that Wales \"can't afford to wait for a tragedy to happen\". Delyth Jewell, a member of the Senedd for South Wales East, says the coal tips are \"ticking time bombs\" and \"Westminster should be paying to clear these tips\". \"Money, it's not a question of [it] should be found. Money has to be found because this is correcting a historic injustice that should never have happened,\" she said. \"And if they can't prioritise clearing the coal tips in the valleys, who do they even represent? Who do they stand for? \"The legacy of Aberfan hangs over these communities.\""

        "Content": "The Israeli military has \"nothing to hide\" and is \"thoroughly\" investigating the fatal shooting of aid workers by its forces in Gaza, an Israeli government spokesman has told Sky News. David Mencer said the Israel Defence Forces (IDF) opened fire \"from a distance\" at a convoy that was \"moving suspiciously in their direction\" on 23 March. Fifteen emergency workers were killed in the incident near the southern city of Rafah. When asked by Sky's Mark Austin on the News Hour why Israel is not allowing an independent investigation into the shooting, Mr Mencer said: \"Israel is not afraid of anything. \"It's not the first time that Hamas has used ambulances to smuggle terrorists. \"It's a matter of public record.\" Asked whether the IDF had any evidence any of those in the convoy were Hamas terrorists before they opened fire, Mr Mencer replied: \"Our investigation is taking place right now.

Hamas has turned them into getaway cars for killers.\"  It comes after the IDF said on Monday that findings from a preliminary investigation found six of those who died were \"identified as Hamas terrorists\". The IDF also said in a statement: \"All the claims raised regarding the incident will be examined through the mechanism and presented in a detailed and thorough manner for a decision on how to handle the event.\" Footage at the weekend showed the moment the aid workers came under fire, with ambulances and fire insignia clearly visible and red lights flashing. The Palestine Red Crescent Society (PRCS) has demanded an independent investigation into the \"atrocious\" deaths of the aid workers.  Israel had earlier claimed the shooting took place in a combat zone, however, an investigation by Sky's data and forensics unit found this was not the case. Asked about the findings, Mr Mencer said: \"There's nothing I'm going to say that is going to prejudice this investigation. \"The results will come out shortly. It's a thorough investigation by the IDF.\" Deported MPs row Mr Mencer has also spoken to Sky News a day after one of the Labour MPs who was denied entry and deported from Israel accused the state of \"control and censorship\". Abtisam Mohamed and fellow Labour MP Yuan Yang were denied entry to Israel when they arrived there on Saturday as part of a parliamentary delegation to visit humanitarian aid projects in the West Bank, they said. Mr Mencer claimed the MPs had wanted people to \"boycott Israel\", adding: \"Boycotting this country essentially means that you do not wish Israel to exist.\" He also accused the two MPs of accusing Israel of \"false crimes\" and \"promoting sanctions\" against the Israeli people.

She called on the government to ensure journalists can work safely in Gaza and then posted on X about many of her former Financial Times colleagues being denied entry to Gaza by Israel, as have all international reporters. Ms Mohamed is Yemeni-Muslim and has been outspoken against Israel in her role on the Foreign Affairs Committee, speaking in the Commons five times on the topic since becoming an MP last July. The MP has described Israel's actions in Gaza as \"war crimes\", something Israel has rejected. She also spearheaded a cross-party call from 61 MPs for a UK ban on Israeli goods. Mr Mencer added: \"We will always defend ourselves.... Because this country is a democracy and we will defend our values.\" In a remark directed at Mark Austin, he continued: \"You may have succumbed to this woke, Islamist ideology - we have not.\" In a joint statement after they were deported, Ms Yang and Ms Mohamed said they were \"astounded at the unprecedented step taken by the Israeli authorities\". \"It is vital that parliamentarians are able to witness, first-hand, the situation in the occupied Palestinian territory,\" they said. Following the incident, Foreign Secretary David Lammy said it was \"unacceptable, counterproductive, and deeply concerning that two British MPs on a parliamentary delegation to Israel have been detained and refused entry by the Israeli authorities\"."

It means residents with growing piles of rubbish outside their homes are still without a solution to the massive mess. Bin workers began their strike on 11 March and Birmingham City Council declared a major incident on 31 March, citing public health concerns. Workers are striking due to a long-running dispute over the role of waste recycling and the removal of the collection officer (WRCO) role, which will leave about 150 members £8,000 worse off according to the Unite union. The council - which denies the claim - has been meeting with representatives from the union.

He then hoses down the enormous pile of rubbish that's been dumped on the pavement right outside his terraced home.  \"You get depressed sometimes, but everyone comes and tips their bags - it's been here for almost five weeks.\" The mound of black bin bags and other junk is about 5ft high and grows everyday – the flies buzz around and there's rat bite marks in the bags.

        "Content": "By Dominic Waghorn, international affairs editor, in France   The impact of Trump's tariffs is reaching deep into every economy. We travelled into the French rural heartland, heading for Cognac - the home of French brandy. It is only half the size of Surrey but its exports to America are worth €1bn a year and that trade is now severely threatened. The first buds are out on the vines of Amy Pasquet's vineyard. An American, she has married into the industry and with her French husband owns JLP Cognac. She knows more than most the bond brandy has formed between their two countries that goes back to the war. Tariffs latest: Follow live updates \n                  Two Chinese citizens captured during fighting in eastern Ukraine, Zelenskyy says\n                 \n                  What we learn from video of captured Chinese national in Ukraine - and the serious questions it raises\n                 \n                  Donald Trump's 104% tariffs on China - and other levies on 'worst offenders' - in effect this morning \n                 Ms Pasquet said: \"A lot of the African-American soldiers had really loved their experience here and had brought back the cognac. And I think that stayed because this African-American community truly is a community. and they want to drink like their grandfather did.\" The ties remain with rappers like Jay Z's love for cognac. However, Ms Pasquet adds: \"There's also this other community of people who have been drinking bourbon for a long time, love bourbon, but find the prices just outrageous today. So they want to try something different.\" JLP's products were served at New York's prestigious Met Gala. They were preparing to launch new product lines in the US. But now that's in doubt. It is hard being an American in France now, Ms Pasquet says. Her French neighbours are appalled by what US President Donald Trump is doing. She continues: \"They're like, okay, America's forgotten how close France and America are as far as (their) relationship is concerned. And I think that's hurtful on both sides. I think it's important to remember that the US is many things, and not just this one person, and there are millions of inhabitants that didn't vote for him.\" A fresh challenge for a centuries-old tradition Making cognac takes years, using techniques that go back centuries. In another vineyard we met Pierre Louis Giboin whose family have been doing it for more than 200 years. In a cellar dating back to the French Revolution, barrels of oak sit under thick cobwebs, ageing the brandy. The walls are lined with a unique black mould that thrives off the vapours of cognac. They have seen threats come and go over those centuries, wars, weather, pestilence. But never from a country they regard as one of their oldest allies and best of customers. Read more:What China could do next as Trump's tariff warHow tariffs will affect your moneyCould Trump's tariffs tip the world into recession? Mr Trump's tariffs, says Mr Giboin, now threaten a way of life. \"It's at the end of like very good times in the Cognac region. It's been like 10 years when everything's been perfect, we have good harvest, we sell really easily all the stock, but now I mean it's the end.\" Ms Pasquet and Mr Giboin are unusual. Most cognac makers sell their produce through the drink's four big houses, Hennessy, Remy Martin, Martell and Courvoisier. Some have been told the amounts they can sell have been drastically reduced. Independents though like them must find new markets if the tariff threat persists. Confusion away from the chaos Outside in the dappled light of a Cognac evening Mr Giboin and I toast glasses of pineau - the diluted form of cognac drunk as an aperitif. In this idyllic corner of France, a world away from Washington, Mr Trump's trade war on Europe simply makes no sense. \"He's like angry against the whole world and the way he talks like that Europe the EU was made against the US to cheat on the US. It's just crazy to think like this,\" Mr Giboin says. It's not just what Mr Trump's done. It's how Europe now strikes back that concerns the French. And it's not just in Cognac where they're concerned France exports more than €2bn worth of wine to America. In the heart of the Bordeaux wine region, Sylvie Courselle's family have been making wine since the 1940s at their Chateau Thieuley vineyard. It's bottling season but they can't prepare the wine headed for America while everything is up in the air. Showing me the unused reels of US labels for her wine she told me she was losing sleep over the uncertainty. Later she was meeting with her American distributors. Gerry Keogh sells Ms Courselle's wine across the US. He says the entire industry is reeling \"I think it's like anything. You don't really believe it's happening. And even when you're in the midst of it, it was kind of like 9/11. \"You're like... This is actually happening. It's unbelievable. And when you start seeing the repercussions from the stock market, et cetera, and how it's impacting every level, it's quite shocking.\" They know the crisis is far from over and could now escalate. \"We feel stuck in the middle of this commercial war and we don't have the weapons to fight, I think,\" Ms Courselle said. It is, she says, very stressful. The histories of America and France have been intertwined for centuries through revolutions against tyranny and two wars fighting for liberty. America used to call France its oldest ally, but under Mr Trump it is now being as turned on, as France, along with the rest of Europe, finds itself in what many would argue is a reckless and unjustified trade war. It is all doing enormous harm to relations between the US and its European allies. How Europe now decides to retaliate will help determine the extent of that damage."

        "Content": "By Steph Oliver, news editor, and Katerina Vittozzi, news correspondent   London schools are at risk of \"increased violence\" and \"gang exploitation\" following the decision to remove specialist police officers, headteachers have told Sky News. Education leaders are \"urging\" the Metropolitan Police to reconsider a decision to transfer 371 safer schools officers into neighbourhood policing teams next month. Teachers warn pupils will be at \"greater risk\" of violence as a result - and some students told Sky News they were worried \"more knives\" and \"more drugs\" would be brought into schools. Safer schools officers were introduced into London schools in 2009, where they help de-escalate peer-on-peer conflict and prevent youth involvement in crime. In a letter obtained by Sky News, a group of 15 headteachers from secondary schools in northeast London have written to the Met Police warning that \"without the support of safer school officers, vulnerable students may become prey to exploitation and, in turn, perpetrators of crime\". Sam Jones, chair of The Waltham Forest Secondary Heads group, which wrote the letter, said teachers were \"extremely concerned\" about the withdrawal of safer school officers and they had not been consulted about the decision. Mr Jones told Sky News that the decision was \"very misguided\". \"We think that it will increase in violence, potentially increase bullying and weapons-related incidents,\" he said. Safer schools officers are a \"key deterrent when it comes to gang recruitment and county lines issues,\" he added. \"I think this is a huge backward step.\" Knife crime hit a record high of 16,521 offences in London in the year ending September 2024 - an 18% increase from the previous year, according to the Office for National Statistics. A Sky News survey of secondary school teachers in England revealed almost one in five had seen pupils with knives in schools. Students from Footsteps Trust in London said the removal of officers could make schools more violent. \"There will be more knives,\" Tyrelle, 14, told Sky News. \"There will be fighting, there will be drugs coming into school and no one will be there to actually stop it.\" \"If anything happens outside of school you can tell them [the safer school officer] and let them know,\" he added. Another pupil, Mikolej, 15, said having an officer in their school had been a \"good thing\" that had helped young people \"speak more to police officers outside of school\". Chris Hall, headteacher of Footsteps Trust, told Sky News it was \"quite staggering\" that no one in education was consulted about the decision. He said the school-based officers had been \"very, very, valuable assets\" who had helped familiarise \"young people with the police in the most positive way\". \"I would 100% ask them [the Met] to re-consider,\" Mr Hall said. Walthamstow MP Stella Creasy echoed calls for the police force to think again, telling Sky News she hoped the force would \"sit down with all of us so that we can work together on this\". In a letter to headteachers, the Met said the changes will come into effect from 2 May and that the decision was \"not made lightly\". The force said the changes aimed to improve their presence in the community.

        "Content": "By Ali Fortescue, political correspondent, and Hannah Woodward, political news editor   It is \"difficult\" to give a \"cast iron guarantee\" that lives won't be lost because of a coal tip disaster, the deputy first minister of Wales has told Sky News.   Nearly 60 years since the Aberfan disaster, which killed 144 people when coal waste slid down the side of a mountain into a school, £130m has been invested in securing waste left behind by coal mining operations. Earlier this year, the Welsh government said up to £600m could be needed to secure coal tips across the nation. Politics latest: Follow live updates Olivia White, who lives beneath a disused coal heap in Cwmtillery that has been deemed a potential risk to public safety, says she is living with \"horrific fear every day, waking up thinking we're lucky we're here again today\". Ms White's home was one of around 40 evacuated when part of the coal tip collapsed last year. She says she will never forget opening the door and \"thick, dirty sludge pouring through\". She warned: \"I think it is going to take somebody to die or something awful to happen until they realise how serious this is. That's what it feels like. Aberfan just lingers over me all the time\". \n                  Politics latest: Trump tariffs had a 'massive impact', says minister - as Starmer brands situation 'very challenging'\n                 \n                  Chancellor to hold tariff crisis talks with top City executives\n                 \n                  Labour MPs back Corbyn calls for Chilcot-style inquiry into UK's role in Gaza war\n                 Her neighbour, Zara Cotterell, says it was \"very lucky\" that children weren't playing outside at that time. She says: \"It was 7.30pm, if it was 5.30pm the street above would have had all the children playing; it took a car, it took a garage, it would have taken lives.\" Work is under way to secure the tip at Cwmtillery, which could collapse again, but both women say they feel \"no one is listening\" to them. There are 2,573 disused coal tips across Wales, 360 of which are categorised as having a potential impact on public safety. Deputy First Minister Huw Irranca-Davies says he can give people an \"absolute guarantee\" that no expense is being spared to fix the problem. However, he said it is \"pretty difficult\" to give a \"cast iron guarantee\" that people are safe. \"It's an almost impossible question,\" he said. Mr Irranca-Davies said the Welsh government has spent the last five years assessing which tips are the most high risk and work is starting to secure them. He added that the £600m figure is a long-term goal to totally clear the tips, not all of which are high risk. In the autumn budget, the UK government provided the Welsh government with £25m for essential work on disused coal tips. The Welsh finance minister Mark Drakeford is seeking a £91m commitment over three years from Westminster. Mr Irranca-Davies says it is \"great\" that \"after years of asking\" there has been a contribution from the UK government. Wales Secretary Jo Stevens says she wants people to feel reassured that coal tips are being inspected regularly and the \"significant sum of money\" given in the autumn budget will deal with the risks. Plaid Cymru says the £25m from Westminster falls short of what should be paid, adding that Wales \"can't afford to wait for a tragedy to happen\". Delyth Jewell, a member of the Senedd for South Wales East, says the coal tips are \"ticking time bombs\" and \"Westminster should be paying to clear these tips\". \"Money, it's not a question of [it] should be found. Money has to be found because this is correcting a historic injustice that should never have happened,\" she said. \"And if they can't prioritise clearing the coal tips in the valleys, who do they even represent? Who do they stand for? \"The legacy of Aberfan hangs over these communities.\""

        "Content": "A murder investigation has been launched after a 60-year-old man was shot through his front window. Durham Constabulary said 35 officers are working on the probe into the death of Barry Dawson, who was shot once at his home on Elm Street, South Moor, Stanley, at around 5.20pm on Saturday. The force said doorbell camera footage showed two figures approaching the home before one smashed the window and another - wearing a hood - shot through the blinds. A man can be heard shouting \"they've killed me dad\" in the footage. A 37-year-old man and a 35-year-old woman were later arrested on suspicion of conspiracy to murder. They remain in police custody. In an update on Tuesday, Superintendent Peter Carr said the \"extensive investigation\" is ongoing. \"This was a frightening incident for those involved and those living nearby,\" he added. \"I'd like to thank the local community for their patience and cooperation while we work to establish exactly what has happened.\" Read more:Meta announces new restrictions for teen Instagram usersGirl and boy 'humiliated' and killed 80-year-old man Mr Carr then said there will continue to be \"significant police activity\" in the area for some time."

        "Content": "A deal for a new Universal theme park in Bedfordshire has been confirmed, which Rachel Reeves says will bring \"billions\" to the economy and create thousands of jobs. It will be the first Universal-branded theme park and resort in Europe and is set to open in 2031, when it is expected to become the UK's most popular visitor attraction. The government said it will bring an estimated £50bn into the British economy and will create about 28,000 jobs - nearly 20,000 during the construction phase, and 8,000 more in hospitality and the creative industries when it opens. A 500-room hotel and a retail and entertainment complex is planned alongside the theme park, which will be built on a former brickworks. Universal, which is owned by Sky News' US parent company Comcast, expects the 476-acre site just south of Bedford to generate nearly £50bn for the economy by 2055, with 8.5m visitors in its first year. The plan remains subject to a formal planning decision process from the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government.

Downing Street said the deal represents \"a major vote of confidence\" in the UK economy and the future of partnerships between the UK and the US.

It will also commit to a \"major investment\" in infrastructure around the Universal site to ensure it is well connected and easily accessible. The announcement comes days after the government approved an expansion of nearby Luton Airport. Mike Cavanagh, President of Comcast Corporation, said: \"We could not be more excited to take this very important step in our plan to create and deliver an incredible Universal theme park and resort in the heart of the United Kingdom, which complements our growing US-based parks business by expanding our global footprint to Europe. \"We appreciate the leadership and support of Prime Minister Keir Starmer, Chancellor Rachel Reeves, Minister for Investment Poppy Gustafsson, Culture Secretary Lisa Nandy and their teams, as we work together to create and deliver a fantastic new landmark destination.\""

The Duke of Sussex, 40, waved at reporters as he entered the Royal Courts of Justice in central London for his appeal on Tuesday morning. He lost a legal challenge last year against the government's decision to remove his right to automatic police protection when he is in Britain. Wearing a dark suit, white shirt and pale blue patterned tie, Harry sat on the back row behind his lawyers in a courtroom packed with journalists and members of the public.

Harry's barrister Shaheed Fatima KC said Ravec did not get an assessment from an expert specialist body called the risk management board (RMB) and instead followed a \"bespoke\" process. \"(He) does not accept that 'bespoke' means 'better'. In fact, in his submission, it means that he has been singled out for different, unjustified and inferior treatment,\" she said. Couple 'felt forced to step back' In written submissions to the court, Harry's lawyers said he and his wife \"felt forced to step back\" from their roles as senior working royals because they thought \"they were not being protected by the institution\". \"But they wished to continue their duties in support of the late Queen as privately funded members of the Royal Family,\" they said.

'Dangerous car pursuit' They also highlight an incident in May 2023 when Harry and Meghan \"were involved in a dangerous car pursuit with paparazzi in New York City\". His lawyers said \"no formal charges were brought but the investigation found reckless disregard of vehicle and traffic laws and 'persistently dangerous and unacceptable behaviour on the part of the paparazzi'\". Sir James Eadie KC, representing the Home Office, said experts, including the chair of Ravec and the chair of the RMB, had decided Harry's \"unique circumstances\" required a \"bespoke approach\" to the provision of his security. Royal 'already treated exceptionally' The prince would be \"better served\" by this approach and the decision did not mean \"personal security of the kind previously provided would under no circumstances be provided\", he said. In written arguments, the government's lawyers said while they recognise that Harry \"disagrees vehemently\" with the decision over his security arrangements, his views are \"legally irrelevant\". Ravec \"implemented the bespoke process\" for Harry and so he is \"already treated exceptionally\", they argued. Written submissions on behalf of both the duke and the government have been redacted and the second day of the hearing on Wednesday will largely be held behind closed doors. The three judges hearing the case previously ruled evidence relating to security arrangements and threat levels, and assessments for Harry and other public figures, was \"highly confidential\" and should and will be heard in private."

        "Content": "By Dominic Waghorn, international affairs editor, in France   The impact of Trump's tariffs is reaching deep into every economy. We travelled into the French rural heartland, heading for Cognac - the home of French brandy. It is only half the size of Surrey but its exports to America are worth €1bn a year and that trade is now severely threatened. The first buds are out on the vines of Amy Pasquet's vineyard. An American, she has married into the industry and with her French husband owns JLP Cognac. She knows more than most the bond brandy has formed between their two countries that goes back to the war. Tariffs latest: Follow live updates \n                  Two Chinese citizens captured during fighting in eastern Ukraine, Zelenskyy says\n                 \n                  What we learn from video of captured Chinese national in Ukraine - and the serious questions it raises\n                 \n                  Donald Trump's 104% tariffs on China - and other levies on 'worst offenders' - in effect this morning \n                 Ms Pasquet said: \"A lot of the African-American soldiers had really loved their experience here and had brought back the cognac. And I think that stayed because this African-American community truly is a community. and they want to drink like their grandfather did.\" The ties remain with rappers like Jay Z's love for cognac. However, Ms Pasquet adds: \"There's also this other community of people who have been drinking bourbon for a long time, love bourbon, but find the prices just outrageous today. So they want to try something different.\" JLP's products were served at New York's prestigious Met Gala. They were preparing to launch new product lines in the US. But now that's in doubt. It is hard being an American in France now, Ms Pasquet says. Her French neighbours are appalled by what US President Donald Trump is doing. She continues: \"They're like, okay, America's forgotten how close France and America are as far as (their) relationship is concerned. And I think that's hurtful on both sides. I think it's important to remember that the US is many things, and not just this one person, and there are millions of inhabitants that didn't vote for him.\" A fresh challenge for a centuries-old tradition Making cognac takes years, using techniques that go back centuries. In another vineyard we met Pierre Louis Giboin whose family have been doing it for more than 200 years. In a cellar dating back to the French Revolution, barrels of oak sit under thick cobwebs, ageing the brandy. The walls are lined with a unique black mould that thrives off the vapours of cognac. They have seen threats come and go over those centuries, wars, weather, pestilence. But never from a country they regard as one of their oldest allies and best of customers. Read more:What China could do next as Trump's tariff warHow tariffs will affect your moneyCould Trump's tariffs tip the world into recession? Mr Trump's tariffs, says Mr Giboin, now threaten a way of life. \"It's at the end of like very good times in the Cognac region. It's been like 10 years when everything's been perfect, we have good harvest, we sell really easily all the stock, but now I mean it's the end.\" Ms Pasquet and Mr Giboin are unusual. Most cognac makers sell their produce through the drink's four big houses, Hennessy, Remy Martin, Martell and Courvoisier. Some have been told the amounts they can sell have been drastically reduced. Independents though like them must find new markets if the tariff threat persists. Confusion away from the chaos Outside in the dappled light of a Cognac evening Mr Giboin and I toast glasses of pineau - the diluted form of cognac drunk as an aperitif. In this idyllic corner of France, a world away from Washington, Mr Trump's trade war on Europe simply makes no sense. \"He's like angry against the whole world and the way he talks like that Europe the EU was made against the US to cheat on the US. It's just crazy to think like this,\" Mr Giboin says. It's not just what Mr Trump's done. It's how Europe now strikes back that concerns the French. And it's not just in Cognac where they're concerned France exports more than €2bn worth of wine to America. In the heart of the Bordeaux wine region, Sylvie Courselle's family have been making wine since the 1940s at their Chateau Thieuley vineyard. It's bottling season but they can't prepare the wine headed for America while everything is up in the air. Showing me the unused reels of US labels for her wine she told me she was losing sleep over the uncertainty. Later she was meeting with her American distributors. Gerry Keogh sells Ms Courselle's wine across the US. He says the entire industry is reeling \"I think it's like anything. You don't really believe it's happening. And even when you're in the midst of it, it was kind of like 9/11. \"You're like... This is actually happening. It's unbelievable. And when you start seeing the repercussions from the stock market, et cetera, and how it's impacting every level, it's quite shocking.\" They know the crisis is far from over and could now escalate. \"We feel stuck in the middle of this commercial war and we don't have the weapons to fight, I think,\" Ms Courselle said. It is, she says, very stressful. The histories of America and France have been intertwined for centuries through revolutions against tyranny and two wars fighting for liberty. America used to call France its oldest ally, but under Mr Trump it is now being as turned on, as France, along with the rest of Europe, finds itself in what many would argue is a reckless and unjustified trade war. It is all doing enormous harm to relations between the US and its European allies. How Europe now decides to retaliate will help determine the extent of that damage."

        "Content": "\n          Asia correspondent\n              @HelenAnnSmith0\n The severity cannot be overstated, if an additional 50% tariffs are levied on all Chinese goods it will decimate trade between the world's two biggest economies. Remember, 50% would sit on top of what is already on the table: 34% announced last week, 20% announced at the start of US President Donald Trump's term, and some additional tariffs left over from his first term in office. In total, it means all Chinese goods would face tariffs of over 100%, some as high as 120%. It's a price that makes any trade almost impossible. China is really the only nation in the world at the moment that is choosing to take a stand. While others are publicly making concessions and sending delegations to negotiate, China has clearly calculated that not being seen to be bullied is worth the cost that retaliation will bring.  The real question, though, is if the US does indeed impose this extra 50% tomorrow, what could or would China do next? It has said it will \"fight to the end\", but what does that mean? In reality, there are few good options. There are some obvious measures that China will almost certainly enact. 👉 Follow Trump 100 on your podcast app 👈 Further export controls on rare earth minerals (crucial for the development of high-tech products) are one example. China controls a huge proportion of the world's supply, but the US would likely find workarounds in time. Hiking tariffs on high-impact US products such as agricultural goods is another option, but there is only so far this could go. The potentially more impactful options have significant drawbacks for Beijing. It could, for instance, target high-profile American companies such as Apple and Tesla, but this isn't ideal at a time when China is trying to attract more foreign investment, and some devaluation of the currency is possible, but it would also come with adverse effects. Other options are more political and come with the risk of escalation beyond the economic arena. In an opinion piece this morning, the editor of Xinhua, China's state news agency, speculated that China could cease all cooperation with the US on the war against fentanyl.

Other options touted include banning the import of American films, or perhaps calling for the Chinese public to boycott all American products. Anything like this comes with a sense that the world's two most powerful superpowers might be teetering on the edge of not just a total economic decoupling, but cultural separation too. There is understandably serious nervousness about how that could spiral and the precedent it sets."

        "Content": "The Israeli military has \"nothing to hide\" and is \"thoroughly\" investigating the fatal shooting of aid workers by its forces in Gaza, an Israeli government spokesman has told Sky News. David Mencer said the Israel Defence Forces (IDF) opened fire \"from a distance\" at a convoy that was \"moving suspiciously in their direction\" on 23 March. Fifteen emergency workers were killed in the incident near the southern city of Rafah. When asked by Sky's Mark Austin on the News Hour why Israel is not allowing an independent investigation into the shooting, Mr Mencer said: \"Israel is not afraid of anything. \"It's not the first time that Hamas has used ambulances to smuggle terrorists. \"It's a matter of public record.\" Asked whether the IDF had any evidence any of those in the convoy were Hamas terrorists before they opened fire, Mr Mencer replied: \"Our investigation is taking place right now.

Hamas has turned them into getaway cars for killers.\"  It comes after the IDF said on Monday that findings from a preliminary investigation found six of those who died were \"identified as Hamas terrorists\". The IDF also said in a statement: \"All the claims raised regarding the incident will be examined through the mechanism and presented in a detailed and thorough manner for a decision on how to handle the event.\" Footage at the weekend showed the moment the aid workers came under fire, with ambulances and fire insignia clearly visible and red lights flashing. The Palestine Red Crescent Society (PRCS) has demanded an independent investigation into the \"atrocious\" deaths of the aid workers.  Israel had earlier claimed the shooting took place in a combat zone, however, an investigation by Sky's data and forensics unit found this was not the case. Asked about the findings, Mr Mencer said: \"There's nothing I'm going to say that is going to prejudice this investigation. \"The results will come out shortly. It's a thorough investigation by the IDF.\" Deported MPs row Mr Mencer has also spoken to Sky News a day after one of the Labour MPs who was denied entry and deported from Israel accused the state of \"control and censorship\". Abtisam Mohamed and fellow Labour MP Yuan Yang were denied entry to Israel when they arrived there on Saturday as part of a parliamentary delegation to visit humanitarian aid projects in the West Bank, they said. Mr Mencer claimed the MPs had wanted people to \"boycott Israel\", adding: \"Boycotting this country essentially means that you do not wish Israel to exist.\" He also accused the two MPs of accusing Israel of \"false crimes\" and \"promoting sanctions\" against the Israeli people.

Ms Mohamed is Yemeni-Muslim and has been outspoken against Israel in her role on the Foreign Affairs Committee, speaking in the Commons five times on the topic since becoming an MP last July. The MP has described Israel's actions in Gaza as \"war crimes\", something Israel has rejected. She also spearheaded a cross-party call from 61 MPs for a UK ban on Israeli goods. Mr Mencer added: \"We will always defend ourselves.... Because this country is a democracy and we will defend our values.\" In a remark directed at Mark Austin, he continued: \"You may have succumbed to this woke, Islamist ideology - we have not.\" In a joint statement after they were deported, Ms Yang and Ms Mohamed said they were \"astounded at the unprecedented step taken by the Israeli authorities\". \"It is vital that parliamentarians are able to witness, first-hand, the situation in the occupied Palestinian territory,\" they said. Following the incident, Foreign Secretary David Lammy said it was \"unacceptable, counterproductive, and deeply concerning that two British MPs on a parliamentary delegation to Israel have been detained and refused entry by the Israeli authorities\"."

        "Content": "\n          Climate reporter\n              @SeabrookClimate\n While wealthy Western countries have been weaning themselves off coal for the last two decades, Donald Trump is now trying to take the US in the opposite direction. The president is issuing further orders to start digging and burning more of what he calls \"beautiful, clean coal\". The good Why? The \"good\" thing about coal is that it is cheap, reliable and abundant. It still provides just over a third of global electricity, and the US has masses of it. Supporters say its existing coal plants only provide power to the grid about 40% of the time, which could easily be boosted by slashing regulation - something which he has already started.

As a result, it's been in decline in richer, Western countries (including the US) since around 2008 - helped by plummeting costs of clean power. It's also why the world (including the US) pledged to \"phase down\" coal at the COP26 climate summit in Glasgow in 2021.  But fast forward around three years, and the world's appetite for electricity is bigger than expected. In the US, electricity demand, after plateauing for years, is now rising at speed. It has been driven not just by energy-hungry AI data centres, which tend to grab the headlines, but things like cloud computing, electric vehicles and a revitalised industrial sector. Like the UK, the US wants to lure AI companies to build on there to bolster economic growth, and to compete with China. Mr Trump sees coal as a cheap way to power all these things. It's a case of \"if China can have it, why can't we?\" - or at least that's what he says on social media. China has continued to build scores of new coal power plants (though it is also building jaw-dropping amounts of solar and wind power). But \"just because they can have lots of coal and lots of renewables in China, doesn't mean that you can do the same in the US\", says Dan Quiggin from the thinktank Chatham House. \"Apart from one thing, the Chinese economy is massive and has grown lots over the years and is continuing to grow.\" The ugly So here's the potentially ugly part for Mr Trump: it's possible the orders have little impact. Gas, wind and solar in the US are largely cheaper than coal power, and are more attractive investments. \"From an economic standpoint, an investment standpoint, coal is orders of magnitude away from alternative energy sources\" like wind, solar, storage and gas, said Sam Berman, from energy consultancy Wood MacKenzie in Boston. \"Executive orders may create a little bit of buzz in the near term. But you need long certainty for these types of investments and shifts, and it's not likely that we'll get there from an executive order.\" Mr Trump also tried this before, attempting to revive the industry during his last presidential term in 2017. No new major coal plants have been built in the US since then - the economics just don't stack up, says Mr Berman. Existing plants could see their lifespans extended after this news. But it all looks like more of a prolonging than a comeback for coal. As ever with Mr Trump, the future is highly unpredictable. But like other energy announcements, the latest should be taken with a pinch of salt."

        "Content": "South Korea's military has said its soldiers fired warning shots at North Korean troops who crossed the demarcation line between the two countries. Around 10 North Korean soldiers violated the military line on Tuesday, but returned after it made warning broadcasts and fired warning shots, South Korea's military said. In a text sent to reporters, South Korea's Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS), said \"North Korean soldiers crossed the military demarcation line (MDL) in the eastern area of the demilitarised zone (DMZ) around 5:00 pm local time. \"Our military is closely monitoring the North Korean military's activity and taking necessary measures according to the operational procedures.\" Some of the North Korean soldiers were armed, according to the South Korean military. There is no clear motive for the crossing, but tensions between the two countries have been running high as North Korean leader Kim Jong Un continues to order missile tests and align with Russia over President Vladimir Putin's war on Ukraine. North Korean special operations units are among the thousands of troops that Pyongyang has sent to Russia to fight in the Ukraine war, according to South Korea. In January, Pyongyang tested a hypersonic missile of intermediate range, in a sign of its determination to continue its weapons development programme. Since re-entering the White House, US President Donald Trump has said he would reach out to North Korean leader Kim Jong Un again to revive diplomatic efforts. The secretive regime has not responded to Mr Trump's remarks, but recently claimed US hostilities against it had deepened since Mr Trump's return to office. Last month, Mr Kim's sister threatened the Trump administration with retaliatory action for stepping up \"provocations\" with the deployment of a US aircraft carrier to South Korea. Bloodshed and violent confrontations have occasionally occurred at the Koreas' heavily fortified border, called the Demilitarised Zone, or DMZ. But when North Korean troops briefly violated the border in June last year, it didn't escalate as South Korean officials realised they were carrying construction tools and decided the incursion was accidental. The 155-mile long (249km), 2.5-mile wide (4km) DMZ is the world's most heavily armed border.

It's a legacy of the 1950-53 Korean War, which ended with an armistice, not a peace treaty. The incursion comes as South Korea copes with a leadership vacuum after the ousting of President Yoon Suk Yeol last week over his ill-fated imposition of martial law."

The royal couple were met by President Sergio Mattarella at his official residence in Rome, the Quirinale Palace, after their limousine was escorted into the palace quadrangle by mounted Corazzieri guards. Laura Mattarella, the president's daughter, acting in a first lady role following the death of her mother, was also there to greet Charles and Camilla. The couple landed at Rome's Ciampino Airport on Tuesday morning, where again they had a red carpet rolled out for them as they were met by dignitaries, including the UK's ambassador to Italy, Edward Llewellyn. Charles, Camilla, President Mattarella and his daughter stood still as they listened to the national anthems of Italy and the UK being played out at the Quirinale. Lined up nearby them were a guard of honour formed of the Quirinale Band, troops from the Italian army, navy and air force, members of Italy's military police the Carabinieri and mounted Corazzieri guards. The King and Queen watched a joint flypast over the capital by the Italian air force's aerobatic team, Frecce Tricolori, streaming Italy's national colours, and the RAF's Red Arrows, who left red, white and blue smoke in their wake. Honours were later exchanged by the King and the president at the palace. The King was made a Knight Grand Cross with Collar of the Order of Merit of the Republic of Italy, and he presented Mr Mattarella with the insignia for a Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the Bath. \"It goes back quite a long way,\" said Charles. \"It's just a token really of our appreciation, you've served for so long.\" \"I'm humbled, your majesty,\" Mr Mattarella replied. The Queen was made a Dame Grand Cross of the Order of Merit of the Republic of Italy, and told her host: \"I'm very honoured and humbled.\" What else has been on Charles and Camilla's schedule? After meeting the president, the couple visited the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier, located within the Victor Emmanuel II Monument (also known as Altare della Patria) in Rome's famed Piazza Venezia, where they laid a wreath. Italian defence minister Guido Crosetto and UK Foreign Secretary David Lammy were also in attendance. Charles and Camilla then headed to the Colosseum, where they took pictures in front of the 2,000-year-old Roman amphitheatre. The couple greeted members of the public during their visit to the Colosseum and beamed as they waved to crowds with the iconic site in the background. British and Italian military bands stood outside the Colosseum, which attracts millions of tourists every year, during the state visit. Built during the first century, in its day the Colosseum held around 50,000 spectators who watched gladiators compete, including contests between men and animals and larger staged battles under the shade of a huge retractable awning. During the royals' visit on Tuesday, spectators were entertained by the band of the Welsh Guards and Italy's Sassari Brigade Band, who played a selection of movie themes and other popular songs. Charles and Camilla are also attending a British community reception later on Tuesday. The timing of Charles and Camilla's visit means they will spend their 20th wedding anniversary on Wednesday in Italy. The trip comes just less than a fortnight after Buckingham Palace confirmed the King had been taken to hospital following side effects related to his ongoing cancer treatment.

        "Content": "\n          Asia correspondent\n              @HelenAnnSmith0\n The severity cannot be overstated, if an additional 50% tariffs are levied on all Chinese goods it will decimate trade between the world's two biggest economies. Remember, 50% would sit on top of what is already on the table: 34% announced last week, 20% announced at the start of US President Donald Trump's term, and some additional tariffs left over from his first term in office. In total, it means all Chinese goods would face tariffs of over 100%, some as high as 120%. It's a price that makes any trade almost impossible. China is really the only nation in the world at the moment that is choosing to take a stand. While others are publicly making concessions and sending delegations to negotiate, China has clearly calculated that not being seen to be bullied is worth the cost that retaliation will bring.  The real question, though, is if the US does indeed impose this extra 50% tomorrow, what could or would China do next? It has said it will \"fight to the end\", but what does that mean? In reality, there are few good options. There are some obvious measures that China will almost certainly enact. 👉 Follow Trump 100 on your podcast app 👈 Further export controls on rare earth minerals (crucial for the development of high-tech products) are one example. China controls a huge proportion of the world's supply, but the US would likely find workarounds in time. Hiking tariffs on high-impact US products such as agricultural goods is another option, but there is only so far this could go. The potentially more impactful options have significant drawbacks for Beijing. It could, for instance, target high-profile American companies such as Apple and Tesla, but this isn't ideal at a time when China is trying to attract more foreign investment, and some devaluation of the currency is possible, but it would also come with adverse effects. Other options are more political and come with the risk of escalation beyond the economic arena. In an opinion piece this morning, the editor of Xinhua, China's state news agency, speculated that China could cease all cooperation with the US on the war against fentanyl.

Other options touted include banning the import of American films, or perhaps calling for the Chinese public to boycott all American products. Anything like this comes with a sense that the world's two most powerful superpowers might be teetering on the edge of not just a total economic decoupling, but cultural separation too. There is understandably serious nervousness about how that could spiral and the precedent it sets."

        "Headline": "Could Donald Trump's widespread 'Liberation Day' tariffs result in a global recession - and how best can the UK prepare for the possibility?",
        "Content": "Donald Trump's \"Liberation Day\" tariffs last week spooked the markets.  Stock markets tumbled on Monday, with most US markets down and stocks in Hong Kong falling 13.2%, their worst day since 1997 during the Asian financial crisis. There was slight growth in Asian and UK markets on Tuesday, but recovery is still a way off after a steep decline in reaction to Mr Trump's tariffs on goods imported to the US, which he announced last week. Tariffs latest: Follow live updates US economists at Goldman Sachs raised their assessment of the odds that America will tip into recession to 45%, up from 35% the week before. And if most tariffs aren't reduced or negotiated away, \"we expect to change our forecast to a recession\", Goldman's chief economist Jan Hatzius said in an analyst note. Other economists are raising similar alarms, with JPMorgan putting the odds of a US and global recession at 60% and projecting inflation will reach 4.4% by the end of this year, up from 2.8% currently. How do you know if a recession has begun? The most commonly used definition of a recession is at least two consecutive quarters of economic contraction - or \"negative growth\" - in gross domestic product (GDP). To break that down, GDP is the total value of goods and services produced over a specific time period. When it goes up, the economy is considered to be doing well. When it goes down - negative growth or economic contraction - it's not doing well. And when it doesn't do well for six months, it counts as a recession.  In the US, the National Bureau of Economic Research is the body which officially declares a recession - taking in a variety of economic data, not just GDP, defining it as \"a significant decline in economic activity that is spread across the economy and lasts more than a few months\". Currently, there are no signs the US or global economy is in recession, and it remains unknown if tariffs will have a large enough impact to knock America's into reverse. But it is this uncertainty that has the potential to cause the most damage. \"People are all at sea,\" Sky News Business Live presenter Darren McCaffrey told the Sky News Daily podcast. 👉 Listen to Sky News Daily on your podcast app 👈 \"No one can quite work out whether President Trump wants a genuine rewiring of globalisation, what the consequences of that will be for the US and globally, and that these tariffs will remain permanent, or whether this is part of a negotiating tactic. \"That's what no one can work out. That uncertainty is difficult, and it is going to cause damage.\" Stockbroker Russ Mould added that the markets are hoping the Trump administration is planning to use tariffs as a way of extracting better trade deals from existing trade partners. If this happens, it would help restore global trade to what's been the standard in recent decades. What could a global recession mean? If the US and the rest of the world falls into recession - even if the UK doesn't - it will \"fundamentally mean we will all be poorer in the future,\" McCaffrey said. He added that Britain especially has not had a prolonged period of serious economic growth for a long time - held back by the financial crisis in 2008, the shock of Brexit, COVID, the Ukraine war and now US tariffs. However, it is not all doom and gloom.  👉 Follow Trump 100 on your podcast app 👈 \"The markets will always find a way,\" McCaffrey says. \"The US is the world's largest economy, but it is only 13% of global trade. Countries like China, Vietnam, Cambodia and others with high tariffs will find new markets. And one of the places that benefit from that in the short-medium term could be the UK. \"It will also force big wealthy blocs - the biggest of which is the EU - to look for new markets. Canada is also suggesting they would like a trade deal with the UK. \"This will cause damage to the US economy more than anywhere else, because other countries will want to be more reliant on more stable partners. As always with economics, there are winners and losers and ultimately the market will find a place for lots of these goods.\" How could the UK best prepare for potential recession? Instead of retaliatory tariffs, the UK is looking to secure a post-Brexit trade deal with the US, Russ Mould explained, calling that \"the UK's primary goal\". But if the UK is stuck with tariffs in the long-term, Mr Mould said it would be wise to consider deals with other countries.  He said: \"Statistics show that 87% of global trade does not involve US, so maybe you can look elsewhere for trade deals with countries who also feel they have been badly treated by tariffs. I would guess India would be at the top of that list. \"The question is how quickly can trade deals be struck, given the fact the UK has been casting the net around for the last five years without a huge amount of progress.\" Read more:Everything you need to know about Trump's tariffsWhat China could do next as Trump's tariff war ramps-upA major economic shock is happening thanks to Trump Mr Mould added that the recipe for economic growth in any market is the growth of the labour force coupled with productivity growth. \"In terms of productivity, [leaders] are probably looking at targeted tax breaks for investment and to stimulate research and development. Other positive things for long-term benefits include examining infrastructure and transport access,\" Mr Mould said. \"In terms of encouraging labour participation, you are into the deep waters of whether it is education or tax breaks for child care. All of those are very long-term solutions to a potential near-term challenge.\" Listen to the full Sky News Daily episode here"

        "Content": "\n          Climate reporter\n              @SeabrookClimate\n While wealthy Western countries have been weaning themselves off coal for the last two decades, Donald Trump is now trying to take the US in the opposite direction. The president is issuing further orders to start digging and burning more of what he calls \"beautiful, clean coal\". The good Why? The \"good\" thing about coal is that it is cheap, reliable and abundant. It still provides just over a third of global electricity, and the US has masses of it. Supporters say its existing coal plants only provide power to the grid about 40% of the time, which could easily be boosted by slashing regulation - something which he has already started.

As a result, it's been in decline in richer, Western countries (including the US) since around 2008 - helped by plummeting costs of clean power. It's also why the world (including the US) pledged to \"phase down\" coal at the COP26 climate summit in Glasgow in 2021.  But fast forward around three years, and the world's appetite for electricity is bigger than expected. In the US, electricity demand, after plateauing for years, is now rising at speed. It has been driven not just by energy-hungry AI data centres, which tend to grab the headlines, but things like cloud computing, electric vehicles and a revitalised industrial sector. Like the UK, the US wants to lure AI companies to build on there to bolster economic growth, and to compete with China. Mr Trump sees coal as a cheap way to power all these things. It's a case of \"if China can have it, why can't we?\" - or at least that's what he says on social media. China has continued to build scores of new coal power plants (though it is also building jaw-dropping amounts of solar and wind power). But \"just because they can have lots of coal and lots of renewables in China, doesn't mean that you can do the same in the US\", says Dan Quiggin from the thinktank Chatham House. \"Apart from one thing, the Chinese economy is massive and has grown lots over the years and is continuing to grow.\" The ugly So here's the potentially ugly part for Mr Trump: it's possible the orders have little impact. Gas, wind and solar in the US are largely cheaper than coal power, and are more attractive investments. \"From an economic standpoint, an investment standpoint, coal is orders of magnitude away from alternative energy sources\" like wind, solar, storage and gas, said Sam Berman, from energy consultancy Wood MacKenzie in Boston. \"Executive orders may create a little bit of buzz in the near term. But you need long certainty for these types of investments and shifts, and it's not likely that we'll get there from an executive order.\" Mr Trump also tried this before, attempting to revive the industry during his last presidential term in 2017. No new major coal plants have been built in the US since then - the economics just don't stack up, says Mr Berman. Existing plants could see their lifespans extended after this news. But it all looks like more of a prolonging than a comeback for coal. As ever with Mr Trump, the future is highly unpredictable. But like other energy announcements, the latest should be taken with a pinch of salt."

        "Content": "\n          US correspondent\n              @jamesmatthewsky\n The US Supreme Court is where the country’s constitution will be tested. Its nine judges have been presented with a number of cases that challenge actions taken by the Trump administration. Their rulings will measure the power of this president. Donald Trump argues he was elected to enact policies as he sees fit. Opponents say he's driving a coach and horses through a constitution that has, as its cornerstone, the executive (presidency), the legislature (Congress) and the judiciary (courts) as coequal and separate branches of government - a framework set up to ensure checks and balances against an abuse of authority. The use of the Alien Enemies Act of 1798 was one such test. It's the wartime law the administration used to fly alleged gang members to a prison in El Salvador.  The highest court in the land has ruled the Trump administration can keep loading up planes with people they think are undesirables from another country. Mr Trump duly hailed the judgment a victory, posting on Truth Social that it was a \"great day for justice in America\".But there's more. While the court has given Mr Trump the ruling he sought in this case, it has emphasised the necessity for proper legal process. The Justices ruled that individuals must be given time to challenge their detention and make the government prove it's legally justified. Some of the men sent over in those planes to Venezuela say they were denied due process. In this ruling, the justices didn't go into whether the Trump administration was wrong to deport some of these men - many of them claim they have no gang affiliations. In favouring the Trump administration's use of the Alien Enemies Act, the Supreme Court added guardrails. Deportees do have the right to go to court and challenge their detention. Also, they have to be given reasonable advance notice so they can attend court and not simply be whisked away in the middle of the night.

He's been told he can use an archaic law to deport people, but they have the right to a fair hearing. There are more than 200 languishing in an El Salvadorian prison who had no hearing at all. Reacting to the court's ruling, Lee Gelernt, of the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), said: \"The critical point is that the court rejected the government's remarkable position that it does not even have to give individuals meaningful advance notice to challenge their removal under the Alien Enemies Act. That is a big victory.\" Both sides claimed the result in America's highest court, even if both know the game's far from over."

        "Headline": "Could Donald Trump's widespread 'Liberation Day' tariffs result in a global recession - and how best can the UK prepare for the possibility?",
        "Content": "Donald Trump's \"Liberation Day\" tariffs last week spooked the markets.  Stock markets tumbled on Monday, with most US markets down and stocks in Hong Kong falling 13.2%, their worst day since 1997 during the Asian financial crisis. There was slight growth in Asian and UK markets on Tuesday, but recovery is still a way off after a steep decline in reaction to Mr Trump's tariffs on goods imported to the US, which he announced last week. Tariffs latest: Follow live updates US economists at Goldman Sachs raised their assessment of the odds that America will tip into recession to 45%, up from 35% the week before. And if most tariffs aren't reduced or negotiated away, \"we expect to change our forecast to a recession\", Goldman's chief economist Jan Hatzius said in an analyst note. Other economists are raising similar alarms, with JPMorgan putting the odds of a US and global recession at 60% and projecting inflation will reach 4.4% by the end of this year, up from 2.8% currently. How do you know if a recession has begun? The most commonly used definition of a recession is at least two consecutive quarters of economic contraction - or \"negative growth\" - in gross domestic product (GDP). To break that down, GDP is the total value of goods and services produced over a specific time period. When it goes up, the economy is considered to be doing well. When it goes down - negative growth or economic contraction - it's not doing well. And when it doesn't do well for six months, it counts as a recession.  In the US, the National Bureau of Economic Research is the body which officially declares a recession - taking in a variety of economic data, not just GDP, defining it as \"a significant decline in economic activity that is spread across the economy and lasts more than a few months\". Currently, there are no signs the US or global economy is in recession, and it remains unknown if tariffs will have a large enough impact to knock America's into reverse. But it is this uncertainty that has the potential to cause the most damage. \"People are all at sea,\" Sky News Business Live presenter Darren McCaffrey told the Sky News Daily podcast. 👉 Listen to Sky News Daily on your podcast app 👈 \"No one can quite work out whether President Trump wants a genuine rewiring of globalisation, what the consequences of that will be for the US and globally, and that these tariffs will remain permanent, or whether this is part of a negotiating tactic. \"That's what no one can work out. That uncertainty is difficult, and it is going to cause damage.\" Stockbroker Russ Mould added that the markets are hoping the Trump administration is planning to use tariffs as a way of extracting better trade deals from existing trade partners. If this happens, it would help restore global trade to what's been the standard in recent decades. What could a global recession mean? If the US and the rest of the world falls into recession - even if the UK doesn't - it will \"fundamentally mean we will all be poorer in the future,\" McCaffrey said. He added that Britain especially has not had a prolonged period of serious economic growth for a long time - held back by the financial crisis in 2008, the shock of Brexit, COVID, the Ukraine war and now US tariffs. However, it is not all doom and gloom.  👉 Follow Trump 100 on your podcast app 👈 \"The markets will always find a way,\" McCaffrey says. \"The US is the world's largest economy, but it is only 13% of global trade. Countries like China, Vietnam, Cambodia and others with high tariffs will find new markets. And one of the places that benefit from that in the short-medium term could be the UK. \"It will also force big wealthy blocs - the biggest of which is the EU - to look for new markets. Canada is also suggesting they would like a trade deal with the UK. \"This will cause damage to the US economy more than anywhere else, because other countries will want to be more reliant on more stable partners. As always with economics, there are winners and losers and ultimately the market will find a place for lots of these goods.\" How could the UK best prepare for potential recession? Instead of retaliatory tariffs, the UK is looking to secure a post-Brexit trade deal with the US, Russ Mould explained, calling that \"the UK's primary goal\". But if the UK is stuck with tariffs in the long-term, Mr Mould said it would be wise to consider deals with other countries.  He said: \"Statistics show that 87% of global trade does not involve US, so maybe you can look elsewhere for trade deals with countries who also feel they have been badly treated by tariffs. I would guess India would be at the top of that list. \"The question is how quickly can trade deals be struck, given the fact the UK has been casting the net around for the last five years without a huge amount of progress.\" Read more:Everything you need to know about Trump's tariffsWhat China could do next as Trump's tariff war ramps-upA major economic shock is happening thanks to Trump Mr Mould added that the recipe for economic growth in any market is the growth of the labour force coupled with productivity growth. \"In terms of productivity, [leaders] are probably looking at targeted tax breaks for investment and to stimulate research and development. Other positive things for long-term benefits include examining infrastructure and transport access,\" Mr Mould said. \"In terms of encouraging labour participation, you are into the deep waters of whether it is education or tax breaks for child care. All of those are very long-term solutions to a potential near-term challenge.\" Listen to the full Sky News Daily episode here"

        "Content": "A deal for a new Universal theme park in Bedfordshire has been confirmed, which Rachel Reeves says will bring \"billions\" to the economy and create thousands of jobs. It will be the first Universal-branded theme park and resort in Europe and is set to open in 2031, when it is expected to become the UK's most popular visitor attraction. The government said it will bring an estimated £50bn into the British economy and will create about 28,000 jobs - nearly 20,000 during the construction phase, and 8,000 more in hospitality and the creative industries when it opens. A 500-room hotel and a retail and entertainment complex is planned alongside the theme park, which will be built on a former brickworks. Universal, which is owned by Sky News' US parent company Comcast, expects the 476-acre site just south of Bedford to generate nearly £50bn for the economy by 2055, with 8.5m visitors in its first year. The plan remains subject to a formal planning decision process from the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government.

There are five Universal theme parks already: Orlando in Florida, Hollywood, Japan, Beijing and Singapore. Downing Street said the deal represents \"a major vote of confidence\" in the UK economy and the future of partnerships between the UK and the US. The announcement comes days after Donald Trump's 10% tariffs on all UK exports set in after British trade teams failed to agree a deal.

It will also commit to a \"major investment\" in infrastructure around the Universal site to ensure it is well connected and easily accessible. The announcement comes days after the government approved an expansion of nearby Luton Airport. Mike Cavanagh, President of Comcast Corporation, said: \"We could not be more excited to take this very important step in our plan to create and deliver an incredible Universal theme park and resort in the heart of the United Kingdom, which complements our growing US-based parks business by expanding our global footprint to Europe. \"We appreciate the leadership and support of Prime Minister Keir Starmer, Chancellor Rachel Reeves, Minister for Investment Poppy Gustafsson, Culture Secretary Lisa Nandy and their teams, as we work together to create and deliver a fantastic new landmark destination.\""

        "Content": "Retail tycoon Sir Philip Green's human rights were not breached when he was named in parliament as the holder of an injunction against the Telegraph newspaper, the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) has ruled. The former Topshop boss previously obtained a court injunction preventing the Telegraph from publishing allegations of misconduct made against him by five ex-employees who had agreed to keep the details of their complaints confidential under non-disclosure agreements (NDAs). Sir Philip \"categorically\" denied any unlawful sexual behaviour. However, he was named as the businessman behind the injunction in parliament in October 2018 by Labour peer Lord Hain who used parliamentary privilege. Parliamentary privilege grants certain legal immunities for members of both the House of Commons and House of Lords and is in place to ensure MPs and peers can go about their work without fear of being sued or prosecuted for contempt of court. Sir Philip brought a complaint to the ECHR, with lawyers for the Monaco-based businessman challenging the absence of controls on the power of parliamentary privilege to reveal information covered by an injunction.  On Tuesday, the ECHR ruled against Sir Philip. In a unanimous decision, eight judges in Strasbourg found the right to privacy under Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights had not been violated. A majority of the judges also found that his complaints brought under Article 6, the right to a fair hearing, and Article 13, the right to an effective remedy, were \"inadmissible\". NDAs are legal contracts often used by companies to preserve confidentiality. If the contract is breached, the party breaking the agreement could be liable for damages in the form of hefty financial compensation.

But his reputation was damaged by the collapse of BHS after he sold the chain for one pound in 2015 to a businessman who had previously been declared bankrupt. Arcadia Group subsequently went into administration in 2020. Sky News has approached Sir Philip's representatives for comment on Tuesday's ruling."

        "Content": "\n          News Reporter\n              @kjjjwilliams\n Much of the past week has been dominated by scenes of tumbling markets, stressed trading floors and world leaders scrambling after Donald Trump unleashed a barrage of tariffs. We're going to take a step back and ask what the chaos means for pensioners, soon-to-be retirees and younger people concerned about their future retirement. Two different types of pensions - one won't be affected Generally, there are two different types of private pensions in the UK: defined benefit (DB, also known as final salary), often used in the public sector, and defined contribution (DC) pensions. \"Those who have a DB pension should be largely unaffected as their payouts are fixed and guaranteed,\" Lucie Spencer, financial planning partner at UK wealth manager Evelyn Partners, told Money. DC schemes are more exposed to the US markets, which have been badly hit. Read the latest Money news here \n                  Chancellor to hold tariff crisis talks with top City executives\n                 \n                  Money: Could my pension be wiped out? Will house prices fall? How tariffs will affect your money\n                 \n                  Donald Trump's 104% tariffs on China - and other levies on 'worst offenders' - in effect this morning \n                 But Anthony Ellis, head of DC Investment strategy at Hymans Robertson, had good news on that front: most DC scheme users were in default strategies that would be de-risking the closer you got to retirement. De-risking means money is moved away from riskier equities and into safer cash and bonds. The worst affected group Mark Chicken, chartered financial planner at The Private Office, warned there was a worst-case scenario where some pensioners, or soon-to-be pensioners, either delayed or came out of retirement. Chicken told Money: \"It's possible people could have to come out of retirement. \"If someone's pension wealth is 100% invested in global equities... and if their retirement plans were thin, then absolutely.\" This was echoed by Jos Vermeulen, a member of the Society of Pension Professionals Investment Committee and head of solution design at Insight Investment. He also warned that people could lose as much as 20% of their income if they're overly exposed to global equities. People in their 50s Those in the middle, say in their 50s, might have seen a largely equity-invested pension take a large hit. Ellis said: \"That's the cohort who might be most concerned because they might see a 15-20% drop in their funds. \"For those people, the comfort I would give is that if you look back at previous sell-offs, the recovery is usually relatively short. \"With your ongoing contributions, you're going to average in at a lower price and markets will recover in the full course, so don't panic.\" What should they do? \"The conversations I am having are: 'This is really painful. It doesn't look great. But we were ready for it,'\" Chicken said. \"It's 100% a case of sitting tight and not doing anything dramatic.\" Lily Megson, policy director at My Pension Expert, agreed: \"Often, the bigger risk lies not in the markets themselves, but in how we respond to them.\" The overwhelming message from experts we spoke to was to keep calm and carry on. Ellis summarised: \"Most people have a pretty terrible track record of timing the market. \"If you panic and take out your money you're almost certain not to time it in the best way. \"You're better off just hanging fire. \"Just carry on and see out this pretty bumpy ride and don't look at your pension value too much.\" \"Don't knee-jerk panic,\" was the message repeatedly expressed to Money.

Ellis expanded on this, adding that young investors shouldn't be discouraged from investing in their futures. All the experts told Sky News that those with decades ahead of them before retirement would see the value recover over that extended period of time."

        "Content": "Donald Trump's tariffs could disrupt the supply of medicines into the UK, the health secretary has warned. Wes Streeting said the government was \"constantly watching and acting on this situation\" after the US president refused to back down from the punitive policy, despite turmoil in the markets. So far Mr Trump has imposed a series of tariffs of varying severity on countries across the world, including a 10% baseline tax on imports from all nations and a 25% levy on all cars imported to the US. Politics latest: PM prepares to face questions from senior MPs His actions have sparked fears of a global trade war, with the UK's benchmark stock market index, the FTSE 100, only just witnessing a slight rise this morning after three days of steep losses. While the reciprocal tariffs have not yet included pharmaceutical products, there are concerns this could change in the near future. Speaking to Wilfred Frost on Sky News Breakfast, the health secretary said that even before the US president's tariff agenda - which has seen him impose a 10% baseline tax on imports from all nations - there had been \"issues with medicines production and supply internationally\". \"We are constantly watching and acting on this situation to try and get medicines into the country, to make sure we've got availability, to show some flexibility in terms of how medicines are dispensed, to deal with shortages,\" he said. \"But whether it's medicines, whether it's parts for manufacturing, whether it's… the ability of businesses in this country to turn a profit, this is an extremely turbulent situation.\" Mr Streeting, who was speaking following the announcement that the government has recruited more than 1,500 new GPs since 1 October, said the steps taken by Mr Trump were \"unprecedented in terms of global trade\". \"As ever in terms of medicines, there's a number of factors at play,\" he said. \"There have been challenges in terms of manufacturing, challenges in terms of distribution, and if we start to see tariffs kicking in, that's another layer of challenge, but we watch this situation extremely closely. \"We work on a daily basis to make sure that we have the medicine supply this country needs.\" Read more:Trump's tariffs could herald painful episodeChina vows to 'fight to the end' over Trump's new tariff threat  Sir Keir Starmer had been seeking to secure an exemption for the UK from Mr Trump's punitive tariffs. But last week, the UK was hit with both the 10% baseline tariff on all imports and the 25% tariff on all cars imported to the US. The latter tariff could prove particularly damaging for the UK, owing to the fact that the US is the car sector's largest single market by country - accounting for £6.4bn worth of car exports in 2023. On Monday, the prime minister announced he would relax rules around electric vehicles in order to mitigate the worst effects of the US tariffs. While the 2030 ban on the sale of new petrol and diesel cars remains in place, regulations around manufacturing targets on electric cars and vans will be altered to help firms during the transition. Luxury supercar firms such as Aston Martin and McLaren will still be allowed to keep producing petrol cars beyond the 2030 date, while petrol and diesel vans will also be allowed to be sold until 2035, along with hybrids and plug-in hybrid cars."

Sky News has learnt that John Fingleton, who stepped down as chief executive of the Office of Fair Trading in 2012 and now runs a leading regulatory consulting firm, is to chair a taskforce announced by the prime minister in February. Whitehall sources said Mr Fingleton's appointment to lead the nuclear regulatory task force could be announced by the PM as soon as next week. Money: The groups most likely to see pensions hurt by market turmoil The focus of the taskforce, which will report back to Sir Keir later this year, will be on incentivising investment in building new nuclear energy capacity in the UK. News of Mr Fingleton's appointment comes days after it emerged that Ed Miliband, the energy secretary, had authorised a further £2.7bn of taxpayer funding for the Sizewell C nuclear plant in Suffolk. A government source said on Tuesday: \"After 14 years of no new nuclear, this government is determined to unlock the power of nuclear energy as part of our clean energy superpower mission. \n                  'British people don't want culture war on climate' says Ed Miliband as cuts to GB Energy ruled out\n                 \n                  Ed Miliband will find Heathrow third runway support 'uncomfortable' but he won't cause 'disruption', Harriet Harman says\n                 \n                  Net Zero Secretary Ed Miliband says he will not resign if govt backs Heathrow third runway - after years of opposition\n                 \"This includes reviewing regulation to drive delivery of new projects, and we will set out further plans in due course.\" Announcing the review in February, the government said removing red tape would enable more nuclear power plants to gain approval, despite widespread scepticism from industry executives about the deliverability of the plans. \"For too long the country has been mired by delay and obstruction, with a system too happy to label decisions as too difficult, or too long-term,\" Downing Street said in a statement at the time. \"The UK was the first country in the world to develop a nuclear reactor, but the last time a nuclear power station was built was back in 1995. \"None have been built since, leaving the UK lagging behind in a global race to harness cleaner, more affordable energy.\" Read more from Sky News:Insurer Hiscox lines up chairman months after Bayesian sinkingPhilip Green's human rights not breached over injunction, court rules It said that while just one new nuclear plant was under construction in Britain, China was building 29 reactors and there were 12 at the planning stage in the European Union. \"Our energy security has been hostage to Putin for too long, with British prices skyrocketing at his whims,\" Sir Keir said in February. \"I'm putting an end to it - changing the rules to back the builders of this nation, and saying no to the blockers who have strangled our chances of cheaper energy, growth and jobs for far too long.\" Mr Fingleton could not be reached for comment on Tuesday."

Sky News has learnt the chancellor will hold talks with bosses from companies including Hargreaves Lansdown, Legal & General, Lloyds Banking Group and M&G amid ongoing volatility in global financial markets. Insiders said the talks had been convened to help frame the Treasury's financial services growth and competitiveness strategy. However, they acknowledged that the fallout from US tariffs, while not directly affecting most City employers, would feature prominently on Wednesday's agenda. \"The chancellor will use this meeting to show leadership, building on her statement to the House earlier today, and reiterating that the government will act decisively to take the right decisions in our national interest and protect working people,\" a Treasury insider said. Ms Reeves would stress a commitment to working with international partners to reduce barriers to trade, while pursuing the best possible bilateral deal with the US, they added.

        "Content": "By Ali Fortescue, political correspondent, and Hannah Woodward, political news editor   It is \"difficult\" to give a \"cast iron guarantee\" that lives won't be lost because of a coal tip disaster, the deputy first minister of Wales has told Sky News.   Nearly 60 years since the Aberfan disaster, which killed 144 people when coal waste slid down the side of a mountain into a school, £130m has been invested in securing waste left behind by coal mining operations. Earlier this year, the Welsh government said up to £600m could be needed to secure coal tips across the nation. Politics latest: Follow live updates Olivia White, who lives beneath a disused coal heap in Cwmtillery that has been deemed a potential risk to public safety, says she is living with \"horrific fear every day, waking up thinking we're lucky we're here again today\". Ms White's home was one of around 40 evacuated when part of the coal tip collapsed last year. She says she will never forget opening the door and \"thick, dirty sludge pouring through\". She warned: \"I think it is going to take somebody to die or something awful to happen until they realise how serious this is. That's what it feels like. Aberfan just lingers over me all the time\". \n                  Politics latest: Trump tariffs had a 'massive impact', says minister - as Starmer brands situation 'very challenging'\n                 \n                  Chancellor to hold tariff crisis talks with top City executives\n                 \n                  Labour MPs back Corbyn calls for Chilcot-style inquiry into UK's role in Gaza war\n                 Her neighbour, Zara Cotterell, says it was \"very lucky\" that children weren't playing outside at that time. She says: \"It was 7.30pm, if it was 5.30pm the street above would have had all the children playing; it took a car, it took a garage, it would have taken lives.\" Work is under way to secure the tip at Cwmtillery, which could collapse again, but both women say they feel \"no one is listening\" to them. There are 2,573 disused coal tips across Wales, 360 of which are categorised as having a potential impact on public safety. Deputy First Minister Huw Irranca-Davies says he can give people an \"absolute guarantee\" that no expense is being spared to fix the problem. However, he said it is \"pretty difficult\" to give a \"cast iron guarantee\" that people are safe. \"It's an almost impossible question,\" he said. Mr Irranca-Davies said the Welsh government has spent the last five years assessing which tips are the most high risk and work is starting to secure them. He added that the £600m figure is a long-term goal to totally clear the tips, not all of which are high risk. In the autumn budget, the UK government provided the Welsh government with £25m for essential work on disused coal tips. The Welsh finance minister Mark Drakeford is seeking a £91m commitment over three years from Westminster. Mr Irranca-Davies says it is \"great\" that \"after years of asking\" there has been a contribution from the UK government. Wales Secretary Jo Stevens says she wants people to feel reassured that coal tips are being inspected regularly and the \"significant sum of money\" given in the autumn budget will deal with the risks. Plaid Cymru says the £25m from Westminster falls short of what should be paid, adding that Wales \"can't afford to wait for a tragedy to happen\". Delyth Jewell, a member of the Senedd for South Wales East, says the coal tips are \"ticking time bombs\" and \"Westminster should be paying to clear these tips\". \"Money, it's not a question of [it] should be found. Money has to be found because this is correcting a historic injustice that should never have happened,\" she said. \"And if they can't prioritise clearing the coal tips in the valleys, who do they even represent? Who do they stand for? \"The legacy of Aberfan hangs over these communities.\""

        "Content": "Donald Trump's tariffs could disrupt the supply of medicines into the UK, the health secretary has warned. Wes Streeting said the government was \"constantly watching and acting on this situation\" after the US president refused to back down from the punitive policy, despite turmoil in the markets. So far Mr Trump has imposed a series of tariffs of varying severity on countries across the world, including a 10% baseline tax on imports from all nations and a 25% levy on all cars imported to the US. Politics latest: PM prepares to face questions from senior MPs His actions have sparked fears of a global trade war, with the UK's benchmark stock market index, the FTSE 100, only just witnessing a slight rise this morning after three days of steep losses. While the reciprocal tariffs have not yet included pharmaceutical products, there are concerns this could change in the near future. Speaking to Wilfred Frost on Sky News Breakfast, the health secretary said that even before the US president's tariff agenda - which has seen him impose a 10% baseline tax on imports from all nations - there had been \"issues with medicines production and supply internationally\". \"We are constantly watching and acting on this situation to try and get medicines into the country, to make sure we've got availability, to show some flexibility in terms of how medicines are dispensed, to deal with shortages,\" he said. \"But whether it's medicines, whether it's parts for manufacturing, whether it's… the ability of businesses in this country to turn a profit, this is an extremely turbulent situation.\" Mr Streeting, who was speaking following the announcement that the government has recruited more than 1,500 new GPs since 1 October, said the steps taken by Mr Trump were \"unprecedented in terms of global trade\". \"As ever in terms of medicines, there's a number of factors at play,\" he said. \"There have been challenges in terms of manufacturing, challenges in terms of distribution, and if we start to see tariffs kicking in, that's another layer of challenge, but we watch this situation extremely closely. \"We work on a daily basis to make sure that we have the medicine supply this country needs.\" Read more:Trump's tariffs could herald painful episodeChina vows to 'fight to the end' over Trump's new tariff threat  Sir Keir Starmer had been seeking to secure an exemption for the UK from Mr Trump's punitive tariffs. But last week, the UK was hit with both the 10% baseline tariff on all imports and the 25% tariff on all cars imported to the US. The latter tariff could prove particularly damaging for the UK, owing to the fact that the US is the car sector's largest single market by country - accounting for £6.4bn worth of car exports in 2023. On Monday, the prime minister announced he would relax rules around electric vehicles in order to mitigate the worst effects of the US tariffs. While the 2030 ban on the sale of new petrol and diesel cars remains in place, regulations around manufacturing targets on electric cars and vans will be altered to help firms during the transition. Luxury supercar firms such as Aston Martin and McLaren will still be allowed to keep producing petrol cars beyond the 2030 date, while petrol and diesel vans will also be allowed to be sold until 2035, along with hybrids and plug-in hybrid cars."

Kim Leadbeater, the MP who introduced the bill, has sent letters to all 650 MPs saying the next debate will now take place on 16 May, instead of 25 April. She said she had listened to MPs \"on all sides of the issue\" who have said they would welcome more time to consider amendments made to the bill through a scrutiny committee of 23 cross-party MPs from both sides of the debate. The new date is now after the local elections on 1 May. Politics latest: Trump tariffs 'very challenging', Starmer says Ms Leadbeater recently said 150 amendments have been adopted to the bill, which aims to allow terminally ill people to end their lives \"on their own terms\". One of the biggest and most controversial amendments has seen the requirement for a High Court judge's involvement scrapped and replaced with a voluntary assisted dying commissioner. \n                  The cheerful optimism of supporters of the assisted dying bill has turned to nervousness\n                 \n                  Assisted dying in doubt as rollout could be delayed until at least 2029\n                 \n                  Isle of Man to become first of British Isles to legalise assisted dying\n                 It will comprise of a judge or former judge to oversee assisted dying cases, along with expert panels featuring a senior legal figure, a psychiatrist and a social worker. Ms Leadbeater also announced an impact assessment of the revised bill will now not be published this week, and she wants MPs to have time to look at it before the next stage (the report stage), when all MPs consider what has been done at the committee stage. She said the delay of three weeks \"is now sensible\", given the comments made on the amendments and her belief \"it is more important to do this work properly than to do it quickly\". The MP added she is \"absolutely confident\" that delaying the next debate will not stall the bill's passage towards becoming law, if MPs support it. In late March, Ms Leadbeater pushed back the rollout of assisted dying - if it passes - to at least 2029 instead of 2027 as she said it was \"more important to do this properly than to do it quickly\". Read more:What is in assisted dying bill?The lengthy delays to assisted dying billOptimism of bill supporters turns to nervousness  She said she believes the amendments already chosen have \"significantly strengthened what was already the most robust assisted dying legislation in the world\". But, she said she appreciates some of the changes are \"significant and colleagues will want time to study them\". She also wants politicians from the Welsh government to have more time to consider how the bill would apply in Wales, as it affects both England and Wales. The amendment removing a requirement for a High Court judge would give the bill \"additional patient-centred safeguards\" by providing a \"range of expertise\", Ms Leadbeater said. Opponents say this \"fundamentally weakens protections for the vulnerable and shows just how haphazard this whole process has become\". After that amendment was accepted, 26 Labour MPs previously in favour said it does \"not increase judicial safeguards but instead creates an unaccountable quango\"."

        "Content": "\n          Political reporter\n              @alexrogerssky\n  Labour have been a \"crushing disappointment\" in government, the Green Party said as it pitched itself as a progressive alternative in its local election campaign launch.  Co-leader Carla Denyer said the country was looking for \"positive change\" but that was not being offered by the government - \"and with every day, it's looking less and less likely that it will\". Ms Denyer, who won the seat of Bristol Central from Labour for the first time in last year's general election, criticised recent policies including the cut to the winter fuel allowance, maintaining the two-child benefit cap and the £5bn reduction in the benefits bill. Labour have admitted the policies are unpopular but have defended them as necessary in light of a turbulent economic landscape, which saw Donald Trump impose blanket 10% tariffs on all imports to the US as well as a 25% levy on car imports. Ms Denyer admitted to Sky News that it was because of Brexit that the UK had only been slapped with a 10% tariff rather than the 20% that has been imposed on EU nations. However, she said the policy was proof that the UK should focus its attention on our \"closest allies\" in the EU. Appealing to disaffected Labour voters, she said the party was now \"making choices that increase poverty, making things so much worse for so many people and burdening councils with an ever-increasing demand on services, on only a fraction of the financial support that they need\". Her criticism was echoed by co-leader Adrian Ramsay, the MP for Waveney Valley, who said Labour have had \"nine months to prove themselves and yet they have failed at every turn\". \"We, like so many others, were hoping that the change in government would make things better after so many years of the Conservatives' cruel and short-sighted cuts to our public services,\" he said. \"We have said all along that we will congratulate Labour and support them where we think they are heading in the right direction - and will push them and call on them to be more ambitious where we think they are getting it wrong. \"Needless to say, we've done less congratulating than we would have liked since they came into government\". The Greens unveiled its local election pitch in Warwickshire - where they form the largest party on Warwick District Council. The party is also hoping to make gains in Gloucestershire, Worcestershire, East Hertfordshire and Lancaster, as well as Devon and Oxfordshire. Derbyshire, North Northamptonshire and Leicestershire are also target areas for the Greens. Other parties are also campaigning ahead of the local elections, which take place on 1 May. The Green Party, which now has four MPs in parliament, is hoping to pick up more council seats in the ballot, which will be held for 23 councils and six mayoralties in England. The party currently has more than 800 councillors in 170 councils across England and Wales. The May ballot will be the first electoral test for all the political parties since the general election, which saw Labour win a landslide victory while the Tories were reduced to just 121 MPs.

Ms Denyer also turned her fire on Reform UK, accusing it of using \"the politics of fear to divide our communities\" and wanting to privatise the NHS. Mr Farage has denied wanting to make people pay to visit the doctor but said Britain should \"re-examine\" how it funds the NHS, including by considering a \"'French-style\" insurance system. At Labour's campaign launch last week, Sir Keir Starmer promoted his record on the NHS, saying the government had delivered two million extra hospital appointments within its first few months in office. Meanwhile, the Conservatives have warned that \"almost every\" council the party won in 2021 could be lost in this year's local elections. Tory leader Kemi Badenoch warned party members: \"It will be the first time since the general election, the greatest defeat in all parties' history, that we fight these seats.\""

The president is issuing further orders to start digging and burning more of what he calls \"beautiful, clean coal\". The good Why? The \"good\" thing about coal is that it is cheap, reliable and abundant. It still provides just over a third of global electricity, and the US has masses of it. Supporters say its existing coal plants only provide power to the grid about 40% of the time, which could easily be boosted by slashing regulation - something which he has already started.

As a result, it's been in decline in richer, Western countries (including the US) since around 2008 - helped by plummeting costs of clean power. It's also why the world (including the US) pledged to \"phase down\" coal at the COP26 climate summit in Glasgow in 2021.  But fast forward around three years, and the world's appetite for electricity is bigger than expected. In the US, electricity demand, after plateauing for years, is now rising at speed. It has been driven not just by energy-hungry AI data centres, which tend to grab the headlines, but things like cloud computing, electric vehicles and a revitalised industrial sector. Like the UK, the US wants to lure AI companies to build on there to bolster economic growth, and to compete with China. Mr Trump sees coal as a cheap way to power all these things. It's a case of \"if China can have it, why can't we?\" - or at least that's what he says on social media. China has continued to build scores of new coal power plants (though it is also building jaw-dropping amounts of solar and wind power). But \"just because they can have lots of coal and lots of renewables in China, doesn't mean that you can do the same in the US\", says Dan Quiggin from the thinktank Chatham House. \"Apart from one thing, the Chinese economy is massive and has grown lots over the years and is continuing to grow.\" The ugly So here's the potentially ugly part for Mr Trump: it's possible the orders have little impact. Gas, wind and solar in the US are largely cheaper than coal power, and are more attractive investments. \"From an economic standpoint, an investment standpoint, coal is orders of magnitude away from alternative energy sources\" like wind, solar, storage and gas, said Sam Berman, from energy consultancy Wood MacKenzie in Boston. \"Executive orders may create a little bit of buzz in the near term. But you need long certainty for these types of investments and shifts, and it's not likely that we'll get there from an executive order.\" Mr Trump also tried this before, attempting to revive the industry during his last presidential term in 2017. No new major coal plants have been built in the US since then - the economics just don't stack up, says Mr Berman. Existing plants could see their lifespans extended after this news. But it all looks like more of a prolonging than a comeback for coal. As ever with Mr Trump, the future is highly unpredictable. But like other energy announcements, the latest should be taken with a pinch of salt."

        "Content": "Teenagers using Instagram will be prevented from using some of its features without parental permission as part from an update to the app. Instagram owner Meta has announced users who are under 16 will not be able to livestream without the approval of their parents. They will also need permission to disable a feature within the app's messages, which automatically blurs images containing potential nudity. The updates are an expansion of the social media giant's Teen Accounts system, which Meta has announced is being extended to Facebook and Messenger. Meta launched its Teen Account programme for Instagram in September to give parents more options to supervise their children's online activity. It follows a growing backlash about how social media affects the lives of young people. Meta said around 54 million teenagers globally had been moved on to Teen Accounts and the latest changes will be rolled out first to users in the UK, US, Canada and Australia. Other safeguards already in place for teen Instagram users include: setting accounts to private by default, blocking private messages from strangers, strict limits on sensitive content, reminders to take screen breaks and restricting notifications during bedtime hours.

In the UK, the Online Safety Act is coming into force, requiring the biggest tech platforms to take action to prevent users, and particularly children, from encountering illegal or harmful content. But tech giants have also been under huge pressure over the use of end-to-end encryption within messaging apps, including Facebook Messenger and WhatsApp, over concerns it will be harder to tackle child abuse. The NSPCC has accused Mark Zuckerberg's firm of \"choosing to turn a blind eye to crimes against children\" by rolling out encryption within Messenger. The firm argues that the feature is vital to protecting users' privacy."

        "Content": "\n          Climate reporter\n              @SeabrookClimate\n Clean power provided 40% of the world's electricity last year for the first time since the 1940s, new figures show. Clean energy comes from nuclear and renewable sources like wind and solar. The milestone has been reached thanks to the \"staggering\" rise of solar, which has doubled in just three years, energy thinktank Ember said in its new report. And solar was the fastest-growing electricity source for the 20th year in a row. It now provides 7% of the world's electricity. But it remains eclipsed by wind, which grew to 8% last year, and nuclear to 9%. Hydropower - produced by running water, usually from rivers or reservoirs, and the world's oldest and largest single source of renewable power - has hovered at 14%. Phil MacDonald, Ember's managing director, said: \"Paired with battery storage, solar is set to be an unstoppable force. \"As the fastest-growing and largest source of new electricity, it is critical in meeting the world's ever-increasing demand for electricity.\"  Nuclear energy is considered a clean energy source because it produces almost zero greenhouse gases or other air pollutants. The report's findings come as US President Donald Trump, in charge of the world's second most polluting country, restricts offshore wind farms and seeks to expand the mining and burning of coal in a bid to fuel booming AI data centres. China and India, the world's largest and third largest polluting countries respectively, are steaming ahead with their clean power plans. More than half the world's new solar electricity came from China last year - though it is still building new coal power plants too. Professor Xunpeng Shi, president of the International Society for Energy Transition Studies (ISETS), said: \"The future of the global power system is being shaped in Asia, with China and India at the heart of the energy transition.\" Electricity demand on the rise Despite the rise in renewable power, electricity from more polluting fossil fuels crept up by 1.4% last year due to surging demand, meaning emissions from the sector rose too to an all-time high. Ember had previously predicted that these emissions would peak in 2023. But a series of heatwaves thwarted those expectations, as the world turned up the air conditioning to cope with hot weather turbocharged by climate change and the El Nino weather phenomenon, which has since subsided. Increases in AI, electric vehicles and heat pumps are also driving up electricity demand. Ember forecasts the growth in clean power will soon outpace the growth in demand, helping to displace fossil fuels from the system. Bruce Douglas, chief executive of the Global Renewables Alliance, said: \"Despite geopolitical and economic headwinds, the renewables industry delivered an additional 858 TWh of generation to the system last year - more than the combined annual electricity consumption of the UK and France.\""

The 3D platformer, which was launched to critical acclaim in September to mark PlayStation's 30th anniversary, was nominated for eight gongs, while Senua's Saga: Hellblade II, led with 11 nods. But in the end, the critics - some of whom had dubbed Astro Bot a \"perfect game\" - were right as it dominated the awards at London's Queen Elizabeth Hall, hosted by comedian Phil Wang for the second year running. BAFTAs for audio achievement, game design, animation, and best family game completed the set for developers Team Asobi, who designed multiple galaxies and dozens of levels for the titular Astro to journey through, retrieving spaceship parts and rescuing lost robots. \"We're a team based in Japan, but we have over 12 nationalities.
