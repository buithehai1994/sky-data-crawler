        "Content": "Donald Trump says he will impose 25% tariffs on all steel and aluminium imports into the US, including from Canada and Mexico. The president said he would make the announcement on Monday, signalling yet another major escalation in his trade policy overhaul. Speaking on Air Force One as he flew from Florida to New Orleans for the Super Bowl, he said the new levies would be on top of existing metals duties. \"Any steel coming into the United States is going to have a 25% tariff,\" Mr Trump told reporters on Sunday. When asked about aluminium, he responded, \"aluminium, too\" will be subject to the trade penalties. The share prices of Japanese steel makers fell around 1% on the news. Mr Trump also said he will announce reciprocal tariffs on Tuesday or Wednesday, to take effect almost immediately, applying them to all countries and matching the tariff rates levied by each nation. \n                  Prince Harry's criticism of 'weak moral character' at Invictus Games felt like a jibe at Donald Trump\n                 \n                  Day 21: Trump's popularity, Musk's influence and America's soft power  \n                 \n                  Judge pauses Donald Trump's plan to put thousands of USAID workers on leave\n                 \"And very simply, it's, if they charge us, we charge them,\" Mr Trump said of the reciprocal tariff plan. Mr Trump previously threatened 25% import taxes on all goods from Canada and Mexico, though he paused them for 30 days last week. At the same time, he proceeded to add 10% duties on imports from China. Also last week, Mr Trump said tariffs on the European Union would be implemented \"pretty soon\". When questioned about the UK, the president said Britain was \"out of line\" when it came to trade but he thought the situation could be \"worked out\" without the use of tariffs. ðŸ‘‰ Follow Trump 100 on your podcast app ðŸ‘ˆ His latest comments on the presidential plane came just after German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said the EU was ready to respond \"within an hour\" if the US levied tariffs on European goods, highlighting the risks of an escalating trade war. China's retaliatory tariffs on some US exports are due to take effect on Monday, with no sign yet of progress between Beijing and Washington. 'Gulf of America' day Also on board Air Force One, Mr Trump signed a proclamation declaring 9 February 2025 as the first ever \"Gulf of America\" day. One of the first executive orders the president signed was renaming the Gulf of Mexico. While signing the latest proclamation, he posed in front of a map with the newly changed name. Trump reiterates desire to make Canada 51st state In a separate interview earlier on Fox News, Mr Trump repeated calls to make Canada \"the 51st state\" as he reiterated his support for tech billionaire Elon Musk.  When asked if he was serious about Canada being a 51st state, Mr Trump said: \"I think Canada would be much better off. \"We lose $200bn a year with Canada. And I'm not going to let that happen. It's too much. \"Why are we paying $200bn a year essentially in subsidy to Canada? Now, if they are a 51st state, I don't mind doing it.\" He also continued to voice support for Mr Musk. The X owner is spearheading the US president's efforts to cut costs and bureaucracy in government, which has already seen the US Aid Agency for International Development targeted. Named the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), its aim is to find ways to sack federal workers, cut programmes and cut federal regulations.

He's been terrific,\" he said."

        "Content": "A police officer who took part in tragedy chanting against Liverpool fans has been sacked. Sergeant Tyler Coppin, of Essex Police, pleaded guilty to the public order offence while at a Premier League match between Liverpool and Chelsea at Anfield on 20 October. Merseyside Police said that the officer was seen by club stewards chanting toward Liverpool supporters, before being ejected from the stadium and arrested by local police. Coppin was handed a three-year football banning order, along with Â£645 in fines and costs in December. On Friday, a misconduct panel - chaired by Essex Police's Chief Constable Ben-Julian Harrington - found Coppin had breached standards of professional behaviour concerning honesty and integrity, authority, respect and courtesy and discreditable conduct. He was dismissed from the force without notice and will be placed on the College of Policing barred list. The chief constable noted Coppin's remorse for the incident and his previously unblemished policing record, but added that while the dismissal was over \"a moment's serious stupidity... this is the only appropriate outcome\". He added: \"His actions will seriously undermine public trust and confidence and I must send a clear message to officers, staff and the wider public that behaviour such as this cannot and will not be tolerated in policing. \"If officers are responsible for upholding the law, it cannot be right that they break it.\" The Crown Prosecution Service describes tragedy chanting as when fans sing, chant or gesture offensive messages about disasters or accidents involving players or fans.

        "Content": "\n          News reporter\n              @samuelosborne93\n Israeli forces have begun pulling back from a key corridor through Gaza as part of its ceasefire deal with Hamas. As part of the deal, Israel agreed to withdraw its military from the four-mile-long Netzarim corridor, which separates northern Gaza from the south. When the ceasefire began last month Israel began allowing Palestinians to cross the corridor and return to their homes, many of which are little more than rubble after 15 months of war. Hamas has celebrated the withdrawal as a victory and said the Hamas-run police force had deployed to the area to supervise the flow of Palestinians passing through. Separately on Sunday, the Palestinian health ministry said two women in their 20s - including one who was pregnant - were fatally shot by Israeli gunfire in the northern occupied West Bank, where troops have been carrying out a broad operation. And five Thai workers who were held hostage for more than a year have arrived back in Bangkok. They were embraced by family members, some of whom cried, in the arrivals hall at the city's airport. They were the second group of Thai hostages released since the war broke out. During an earlier ceasefire, in November 2023, 23 Thai nationals were released in exchange for assistance from Qatar and Iran. Little progress in negotiating second phase of deal Little progress has emerged in negotiating the second phase of the deal, which is supposed to see all Israeli hostages released in return for a complete Israeli withdrawal from Gaza. A delegation from Israel has arrived in Doha for further talks, amid concern the deal might collapse before all 76 remaining hostages are freed. Israel has previously said it will not agree to a complete withdrawal until Hamas's military and political capabilities are eliminated - while Hamas has countered that it will not hand over the final hostages until Israel removes all its troops from Gaza. During the first 42-day phase of the deal, which began on 19 January, Hamas has been gradually releasing 33 Israeli hostages captured during its rampage into Israel on 7 October 2023 in exchange for the return of hundreds of Palestinian prisoners. Read more:What you need to know about Trump's Gaza planThe Israel-Hamas war in numbers  Trump to meet leaders of Saudi Arabia and Egypt The issue has been further complicated in recent weeks by Donald Trump's proposal to relocate Palestinians so the US can take over Gaza. The US president said his country would then develop the land and turn it into the \"Riviera of the Middle East,\" while the enclave's population of two million are resettled in nearby countries such as Egypt and Jordan. Speaking on Air Force One on his way to the Super Bowl on Sunday, Mr Trump reiterated this idea, saying he would make Gaza into a \"good site\" for future development. He said he was committed to buying and owning in Gaza, adding that he may give sections to other states in the Middle East to rebuild. Israel welcomed the idea, with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu saying a Palestinian state should be created in Saudi Arabia because \"they have a lot of land over there\". But the Arab world has rejected Mr Trump's idea, with Saudi Arabia saying Mr Netanyau's remarks \"aim to divert attention from the successive crimes committed by the Israeli occupation against our Palestinian brothers in Gaza, including the ethnic cleansing they are being subjected to\". Now Mr Trump is set to meet Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi and possibly Saudi Arabian Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, the Israeli president Isaac Herzog has said, although he gave no exact dates for the talks. Israel's war with Hamas, which has left much of Gaza devastated, was sparked when Hamas crossed into Israel on 7 October 2023, killing around 1,200 Israelis and taking around 250 hostages. The war has killed more than 47,000 people, according to the Hamas-run health ministry, which does not differentiate between civilians and combatants."

        "Content": " Reform UK leader Nigel Farage has said the party now has more than 200,000 members and is aiming to overtake the Labour Party's total of 309,000. Speaking to delegates at a regional conference in Wiltshire, the Clacton MP called his party's growth \"truly extraordinary\" since its founding in 2021 as the re-launch of the Brexit Party. With the party's live membership ticker displayed on a screen behind him, he said it was on course to become \"the biggest political party in this country\". \"That's our goal. That's our aim. That's our target,\" he said. Reform UK is already ahead of the Conservatives, who revealed in November that almost 132,000 members were eligible to vote during the party's leadership election to replace Rishi Sunak. Referring to last year's row with new Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch, when she doubted Reform's total membership, he said the party \"got people to come in and check and look at the back end, and it's all absolutely legit\". Reflecting on Reform UK's rapid growth, he said: \"In the modern world to have got here this quickly, isn't it truly extraordinary? \"Doesn't it show you something is happening in this country? People want real political leadership. They want real change. That's what that tells you.\" The party polled more than four million votes in last year's election, winning five seats, including Mr Farage's Essex constituency. Mr Farage, the former head of UKIP, had ruled himself out of standing but made a U-turn after saying he had a \"terrible sense of guilt\" for not offering to run. In another sign of its growing threat to the main parties, last week, Reform UK came top in a poll of people who voted Conservative at the last election. Switching his focus to their political opponents, he declared that \"when we overtake [the Labour Party], we will be the biggest political party in this country\". The Tories had \"betrayed the country with open door immigration, increased taxes, with not delivering Brexit\", he said. \"A 10 million increase in the population of this country over the course of the last 20 years has devalued the living standards of everybody in this country,\" Mr Farage added. \"It's truly incredible. The wave of people that came under Boris Johnson from 2021, of the millions that came, only 20% are working or contributing. The rest are costing us, the taxpayer. It's an outrage.\" Read more:More ministers 'could be caught up' in scandalWarning to MPs behind Reform threat chat groupGreen or growth?

        "Content": "A police officer who took part in tragedy chanting against Liverpool fans has been sacked. Sergeant Tyler Coppin, of Essex Police, pleaded guilty to the public order offence while at a Premier League match between Liverpool and Chelsea at Anfield on 20 October. Merseyside Police said that the officer was seen by club stewards chanting toward Liverpool supporters, before being ejected from the stadium and arrested by local police. Coppin was handed a three-year football banning order, along with Â£645 in fines and costs in December. On Friday, a misconduct panel - chaired by Essex Police's Chief Constable Ben-Julian Harrington - found Coppin had breached standards of professional behaviour concerning honesty and integrity, authority, respect and courtesy and discreditable conduct. He was dismissed from the force without notice and will be placed on the College of Policing barred list. The chief constable noted Coppin's remorse for the incident and his previously unblemished policing record, but added that while the dismissal was over \"a moment's serious stupidity... this is the only appropriate outcome\". He added: \"His actions will seriously undermine public trust and confidence and I must send a clear message to officers, staff and the wider public that behaviour such as this cannot and will not be tolerated in policing. \"If officers are responsible for upholding the law, it cannot be right that they break it.\" The Crown Prosecution Service describes tragedy chanting as when fans sing, chant or gesture offensive messages about disasters or accidents involving players or fans.

Temperatures will possibly turn milder over the weekend, with daytime highs generally a few degrees below the February average and often a rather raw east to south-easterly wind. Fairly cloudy skies and the wind will tend to keep most places frost-free, although it will feel freezing, but lighter winds and clearer conditions over western parts in particular will allow temperatures to drop below zero on occasion. Get the weather forecast where you are Some parts of north-western Scotland may see temperatures as low as -6C tonight. It will be cloudy for many with rain and showers at times. A covering of snow is likely over some hills, and over some central parts. There will also be icy patches and overnight frost in places, although the weather is not expected to be disruptive. A yellow cold health alert has been issued by the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) for the south-east of England and parts of northern England and remains in place until 9am on 11 February.

        "Content": " Reform UK leader Nigel Farage has said the party now has more than 200,000 members and is aiming to overtake the Labour Party's total of 309,000. Speaking to delegates at a regional conference in Wiltshire, the Clacton MP called his party's growth \"truly extraordinary\" since its founding in 2021 as the re-launch of the Brexit Party. With the party's live membership ticker displayed on a screen behind him, he said it was on course to become \"the biggest political party in this country\". \"That's our goal. That's our aim. That's our target,\" he said. Reform UK is already ahead of the Conservatives, who revealed in November that almost 132,000 members were eligible to vote during the party's leadership election to replace Rishi Sunak. Referring to last year's row with new Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch, when she doubted Reform's total membership, he said the party \"got people to come in and check and look at the back end, and it's all absolutely legit\". Reflecting on Reform UK's rapid growth, he said: \"In the modern world to have got here this quickly, isn't it truly extraordinary? \"Doesn't it show you something is happening in this country? People want real political leadership. They want real change. That's what that tells you.\" The party polled more than four million votes in last year's election, winning five seats, including Mr Farage's Essex constituency. Mr Farage, the former head of UKIP, had ruled himself out of standing but made a U-turn after saying he had a \"terrible sense of guilt\" for not offering to run. In another sign of its growing threat to the main parties, last week, Reform UK came top in a poll of people who voted Conservative at the last election. Switching his focus to their political opponents, he declared that \"when we overtake [the Labour Party], we will be the biggest political party in this country\". The Tories had \"betrayed the country with open door immigration, increased taxes, with not delivering Brexit\", he said. \"A 10 million increase in the population of this country over the course of the last 20 years has devalued the living standards of everybody in this country,\" Mr Farage added. \"It's truly incredible. The wave of people that came under Boris Johnson from 2021, of the millions that came, only 20% are working or contributing. The rest are costing us, the taxpayer. It's an outrage.\" Read more:More ministers 'could be caught up' in scandalWarning to MPs behind Reform threat chat groupGreen or growth? Only one winner for PM Spelling out Reform UK's key platform, he said: \"Anyone that comes here illegally will be deported. Simple as that. \"We're the only party that says 'no more population increase through immigration for many years to come'.\" Calling it \"the one net zero I approve of\", he said the UK \"hasn't got enough houses, we can't get GP appointments, our roads are completely overloaded, our infrastructure is crumbling\"."

        "Content": " Five Thai men held hostage for 15 months in Gaza have arrived back in their home country where they were reunited with their families. Pongsak Thaenna, 36, Sarusak Rumnao, 32, Watchara Sriaoun, 33, Sathian Suwannakham, 35, and Bannawat Saethao, 27, were released by militants on 30 January as part of a ceasefire deal between Israel and Hamas. Mr Pongsak said all of the group \"feel grateful and are so delighted to return to our motherland once again\". In emotional scenes at Suvarnabhumi Airport in the Thai capital Bangkok on Sunday, they were met with embraces from their loved ones, some of whom cried. The farm workers were assessed at a hospital outside Tel Aviv before their return. Earlier this week, four of them were joined by one relative each. The five had been taken during Hamas's cross-border attack in southern Israel on 7 October 2023, when 1,200 people were killed and about 250 others kidnapped. During the assault, gunmen killed 41 Thais and seized 31 others, making them the largest group of foreigners held captive in Gaza. \n                  Israeli forces withdraw from key Netzarim corridor in Gaza\n                 \n                  Israel reacts with anger to hostage treatment - where does this leave the ceasefire?\n                 \n                  Hamas names three Israeli hostages it says it will release today after accusing Israel of breaching Gaza ceasefire\n                 Praise for officials Speaking during a news conference, Mr Pongsak praised officials for helping to get the group freed. He said: \"I would like to thank the prime minister, Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Ministry of Labour and relevant officers who helped us to be released. \"For today I get to be standing right here. It wouldn't have happened if it wasn't because of each one of you who provided assistance. \"All of us here feel grateful and are so delighted to return to our motherland once again. We all thank you very much. I don't know what to say. Thank you very much.\" Speaking to Sky News, Mr Pongsak's father, Wilas Thaenna, 64, from Buriram province, said he was feeling \"very very glad. I'm so touched\". \"I was so overwhelmed. I was speechless.\" The group then left to return to their hometowns in Thailand's northern and northeastern regions. 'We never gave up' Thai foreign minister Maris Sangiampongsa, who escorted the hostages back from Israel, expressed relief at their return. \"This is emotional... to come back to the embrace of their families,\" he said. \"We never gave up and this was the fruit of that.\" It comes a day after Hamas handed over three Israeli hostages whose gaunt appearance shocked Israelis, and Israel freed dozens of Palestinian prisoners in the latest stage of a fragile ceasefire aimed at ending the Gaza war.

During a ceasefire-hostage deal in November 2023, some 23 Thais were released in an agreement negotiated between Thailand and Hamas, with assistance from Qatar and Iran. A Thai national is still believed to be held captive by Hamas, according to Thailand's foreign ministry. \"We still have hope and continue to work to bring them back,\" Mr Maris said, adding that this includes the bodies of two Thais. More than 47,000 Palestinians in Gaza have been killed in Israel's offensive, said the Hamas-run health ministry. The ministry does not distinguish between civilians and combatants in its count but has said that more than half of the fatalities are women and children."

        "Content": "\n          News reporter\n              @samuelosborne93\n Israeli forces have begun pulling back from a key corridor through Gaza as part of its ceasefire deal with Hamas. As part of the deal, Israel agreed to withdraw its military from the four-mile-long Netzarim corridor, which separates northern Gaza from the south. When the ceasefire began last month Israel began allowing Palestinians to cross the corridor and return to their homes, many of which are little more than rubble after 15 months of war. Hamas has celebrated the withdrawal as a victory and said the Hamas-run police force had deployed to the area to supervise the flow of Palestinians passing through. Separately on Sunday, the Palestinian health ministry said two women in their 20s - including one who was pregnant - were fatally shot by Israeli gunfire in the northern occupied West Bank, where troops have been carrying out a broad operation. And five Thai workers who were held hostage for more than a year have arrived back in Bangkok. They were embraced by family members, some of whom cried, in the arrivals hall at the city's airport. They were the second group of Thai hostages released since the war broke out. During an earlier ceasefire, in November 2023, 23 Thai nationals were released in exchange for assistance from Qatar and Iran. Little progress in negotiating second phase of deal Little progress has emerged in negotiating the second phase of the deal, which is supposed to see all Israeli hostages released in return for a complete Israeli withdrawal from Gaza. A delegation from Israel has arrived in Doha for further talks, amid concern the deal might collapse before all 76 remaining hostages are freed. Israel has previously said it will not agree to a complete withdrawal until Hamas's military and political capabilities are eliminated - while Hamas has countered that it will not hand over the final hostages until Israel removes all its troops from Gaza. During the first 42-day phase of the deal, which began on 19 January, Hamas has been gradually releasing 33 Israeli hostages captured during its rampage into Israel on 7 October 2023 in exchange for the return of hundreds of Palestinian prisoners. Read more:What you need to know about Trump's Gaza planThe Israel-Hamas war in numbers  Trump to meet leaders of Saudi Arabia and Egypt The issue has been further complicated in recent weeks by Donald Trump's proposal to relocate Palestinians so the US can take over Gaza. The US president said his country would then develop the land and turn it into the \"Riviera of the Middle East,\" while the enclave's population of two million are resettled in nearby countries such as Egypt and Jordan. Speaking on Air Force One on his way to the Super Bowl on Sunday, Mr Trump reiterated this idea, saying he would make Gaza into a \"good site\" for future development. He said he was committed to buying and owning in Gaza, adding that he may give sections to other states in the Middle East to rebuild. Israel welcomed the idea, with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu saying a Palestinian state should be created in Saudi Arabia because \"they have a lot of land over there\". But the Arab world has rejected Mr Trump's idea, with Saudi Arabia saying Mr Netanyau's remarks \"aim to divert attention from the successive crimes committed by the Israeli occupation against our Palestinian brothers in Gaza, including the ethnic cleansing they are being subjected to\". Now Mr Trump is set to meet Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi and possibly Saudi Arabian Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, the Israeli president Isaac Herzog has said, although he gave no exact dates for the talks. Israel's war with Hamas, which has left much of Gaza devastated, was sparked when Hamas crossed into Israel on 7 October 2023, killing around 1,200 Israelis and taking around 250 hostages. The war has killed more than 47,000 people, according to the Hamas-run health ministry, which does not differentiate between civilians and combatants."

Just days after being re-elected to the Seanad (Senate), Martin Conway admitted that he was arrested in the early hours of 22 January \"for being in an intoxicated state due to consumption of sleeping tablets and alcohol\". He said: \"I was detained at Store Street Garda Station and subsequently released without charge a number of hours later.\" The 50-year-old member of the Seanad (the upper house) admitted that he did not inform his party of the arrest. Senator Conway was a member of Fine Gael, led by the current deputy prime minister Simon Harris. In a statement, the senator said he \"would like to apologise unreservedly for this to my family, colleagues, supporters and my nominating body, Vision Ireland\".

I would also like to apologise to the members of An Garda SÃ­ochÃ¡na [Irish police] for having to deal with this matter. \"I have resigned from the Fine Gael Parliamentary Party. I understand that a disciplinary process will now commence.\" Fine Gael said it \"notes\" the senator's \"statement, apologies and his resignation of the party whip\", and confirmed the matter is now subject to a party disciplinary process. Senator Conway, from Co Clare, was born with congenital cataracts. He has been a board member of the charity Vision Ireland since 2013. The organisation has been approached for comment. His arrest took place just hours before the Dail (lower house of the parliament) met to confirm Micheal Martin as the new taoiseach, or prime minister. Chaotic scenes in the chamber over speaking rights led to that process being postponed until the following day. New senators were elected or nominated in an election in January. Just six days ago, Senator Conway said he was \"absolutely delighted\" to be re-elected and thanked his supporters. The Seanad consists of 60 members, who are elected to five vocational panels, from two university constituencies or nominated by the taoiseach. New senators include former Sky News broadcaster Alison Comyn."

The president said he would make the announcement on Monday, signalling yet another major escalation in his trade policy overhaul. Speaking on Air Force One as he flew from Florida to New Orleans for the Super Bowl, he said the new levies would be on top of existing metals duties. \"Any steel coming into the United States is going to have a 25% tariff,\" Mr Trump told reporters on Sunday. When asked about aluminium, he responded, \"aluminium, too\" will be subject to the trade penalties. The share prices of Japanese steel makers fell around 1% on the news.

Mr Trump previously threatened 25% import taxes on all goods from Canada and Mexico, though he paused them for 30 days last week. At the same time, he proceeded to add 10% duties on imports from China. Also last week, Mr Trump said tariffs on the European Union would be implemented \"pretty soon\". When questioned about the UK, the president said Britain was \"out of line\" when it came to trade but he thought the situation could be \"worked out\" without the use of tariffs. ðŸ‘‰ Follow Trump 100 on your podcast app ðŸ‘ˆ His latest comments on the presidential plane came just after German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said the EU was ready to respond \"within an hour\" if the US levied tariffs on European goods, highlighting the risks of an escalating trade war. China's retaliatory tariffs on some US exports are due to take effect on Monday, with no sign yet of progress between Beijing and Washington. 'Gulf of America' day Also on board Air Force One, Mr Trump signed a proclamation declaring 9 February 2025 as the first ever \"Gulf of America\" day. One of the first executive orders the president signed was renaming the Gulf of Mexico. While signing the latest proclamation, he posed in front of a map with the newly changed name. Trump reiterates desire to make Canada 51st state In a separate interview earlier on Fox News, Mr Trump repeated calls to make Canada \"the 51st state\" as he reiterated his support for tech billionaire Elon Musk.  When asked if he was serious about Canada being a 51st state, Mr Trump said: \"I think Canada would be much better off. \"We lose $200bn a year with Canada. And I'm not going to let that happen. It's too much. \"Why are we paying $200bn a year essentially in subsidy to Canada? Now, if they are a 51st state, I don't mind doing it.\" He also continued to voice support for Mr Musk. The X owner is spearheading the US president's efforts to cut costs and bureaucracy in government, which has already seen the US Aid Agency for International Development targeted. Named the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), its aim is to find ways to sack federal workers, cut programmes and cut federal regulations.

Mr Musk said at the time the account would be suspended after he posted an image that appeared to show a swastika inside a Star of David. Mr Musk said the suspension was \"for incitement to violence\". The account was unsuspended by July 2023. In October 2022, West's account was restricted over antisemitic comments but he returned to the platform the following month.

        "Content": "\n          Royal correspondent\n              @laurabundock\n  Prince Harry's memoir dropped so many bombshells, his admission of drug-taking certainly was not the most jaw-dropping revelation. But it did start a campaign by a US thinktank to question whether he lied on his visa application or was given special dispensation. Two years later, the legal case rumbles on, but the Duke of Sussex might have been thrown an unexpected lifeline by US President Donald Trump, who once said he would not protect the prince if he was re-elected because \"he betrayed the Queen\". In a recent interview with the New York Post, Mr Trump said he would not intervene in Harry's case. Mr Trump said: \"I don't want to do that. I'll leave him alone. He's got enough problems with his wife. She's terrible.\" The comments might help Harry's case, but Mr Trump clearly could not resist another attack on Meghan Markle. It's no great surprise - he's aired derogatory views before, branding her \"nasty\" and more recently saying: \"I'm not a fan of hers.\" As for the Sussexes, there will be little love lost. Meghan once called Mr Trump \"misogynistic\", albeit before she married Harry. The couple have not directly expressed their political persuasion, but Meghan spoke positively about Kamala Harris being named Joe Biden's running mate in 2020. The couple have also worked closely with Mr Biden's daughter, who runs a wellness centre for women who have suffered trauma. Since they left their roles as working royals, the duke and duchess have been able to speak out more freely. And to that, hours after Mr Trump made his Meghan comments, Harry used his opening speech at the Invictus Games to criticise \"weak moral character\". It feels like a jibe at Mr Trump. Invictus has always been a cause very close to Harry's heart, and one which is widely respected. It is also familiar territory for the Sussexes. It was at these games in Canada in 2017 that they made their first public appearance together. So much has happened since we saw them there. They wanted to escape from the scrutiny and intrusion of royal life. But the negative headlines which they were so desperate to escape, are harder to leave behind."

Sky News has learnt that executives from companies including Barclays, HSBC, Lloyds Banking Group, NatWest and Nationwide have been asked to attend a meeting with Ms Reeves on Wednesday. The talks have been convened to discuss Labour's financial services growth strategy - one of the pillars of the wider industrial strategy being drawn up by ministers. Among the attendees at the meeting are expected to be Georges Elhedery, HSBC Holdings' CEO; Debbie Crosbie, CEO of Nationwide; Charlie Nunn, the Lloyds Banking Group chief; Paul Thwaite, NatWest CEO; and senior representatives of Barclays and Santander UK. The meeting will come as the UK-listed banks begin their full-year results reporting season in earnest, with Barclays due to unveil its 2024 figures on Thursday. The chancellor has been spearheading efforts to kickstart economic growth in recent weeks, following a disastrous reaction to her inaugural Budget last autumn.

        "Content": "\n          News correspondent\n              @AlicePorterTV\n  Reports of \"ghost broking\", scammers selling fake car insurance, have risen by 30% over the last five years, exclusive data obtained by Sky News reveals. Ghost brokers sell false policies to drivers, manipulate information given to genuine insurance companies, or take out insurance and cancel it straight away. This leaves people without valid car insurance, which is illegal. Wayne Simpson lost over Â£500 to a ghost broker. He was looking for cheap car insurance and saw an advertisement on social media for a deal which was half the price of other companies. He bought the policy, and it was only when he tried to make a claim after a crash that he discovered the truth: \"We called up Aviva and they told me there wasn't a policy taken out in my name and that the number we had given them was not a number they would use. \"That's when the dust settles, and you realise it's been a scam.\" Aviva was not at fault. Victims are lured in by genuine-looking websites and are sent professional-looking invoices. Mr Simpson received insurance documents that looked so real, they even fooled the police officer at the accident. \"She said, 'Your car's not popping up as insured'. Straight away I went to my glove box, pulled the insurance documents, showed her the documents and she read through it and said, 'That's totally fine',\" he said.

According to the RAC, almost half of young drivers said insurance costs were a top concern. Exclusive data obtained by Sky News from Action Fraud reveals \"ghost broking\" reports have risen by 30% since 2019. Detective Superintendent Tom Hill, head of the City of London Police's Insurance Fraud Enforcement Department, said social media is behind this increase: \"There are limited barriers to entry for social media accounts to be set up so people can take out car insurance and spread the word quite widely. \"Do your research and make sure you're dealing with a genuine broker or genuine insurance company. If the conversation has been moved on to WhatsApp, for example, alarm bells should be ringing\". In 2024, victims of ghost broking lost an average of Â£2,206. Victims lose money to the scam and then have to pay additional costs to repair their cars after an accident. They could also face criminal charges, a fine or licence points if found to be driving without a valid licence."

        "Content": " Reform UK leader Nigel Farage has said the party now has more than 200,000 members and is aiming to overtake the Labour Party's total of 309,000. Speaking to delegates at a regional conference in Wiltshire, the Clacton MP called his party's growth \"truly extraordinary\" since its founding in 2021 as the re-launch of the Brexit Party. With the party's live membership ticker displayed on a screen behind him, he said it was on course to become \"the biggest political party in this country\". \"That's our goal. That's our aim. That's our target,\" he said. Reform UK is already ahead of the Conservatives, who revealed in November that almost 132,000 members were eligible to vote during the party's leadership election to replace Rishi Sunak. Referring to last year's row with new Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch, when she doubted Reform's total membership, he said the party \"got people to come in and check and look at the back end, and it's all absolutely legit\". Reflecting on Reform UK's rapid growth, he said: \"In the modern world to have got here this quickly, isn't it truly extraordinary? \"Doesn't it show you something is happening in this country? People want real political leadership. They want real change. That's what that tells you.\" The party polled more than four million votes in last year's election, winning five seats, including Mr Farage's Essex constituency. Mr Farage, the former head of UKIP, had ruled himself out of standing but made a U-turn after saying he had a \"terrible sense of guilt\" for not offering to run. In another sign of its growing threat to the main parties, last week, Reform UK came top in a poll of people who voted Conservative at the last election. Switching his focus to their political opponents, he declared that \"when we overtake [the Labour Party], we will be the biggest political party in this country\". The Tories had \"betrayed the country with open door immigration, increased taxes, with not delivering Brexit\", he said. \"A 10 million increase in the population of this country over the course of the last 20 years has devalued the living standards of everybody in this country,\" Mr Farage added. \"It's truly incredible. The wave of people that came under Boris Johnson from 2021, of the millions that came, only 20% are working or contributing. The rest are costing us, the taxpayer. It's an outrage.\" Read more:More ministers 'could be caught up' in scandalWarning to MPs behind Reform threat chat groupGreen or growth?

        "Content": "\n          Sky News commentator\n              @adamboultonTABB\n Margaret Thatcher died on 8 April 2013. But the UK's longest-serving post-war prime minister still casts a long shadow over politics today, more than a decade later. Only last week the Labour Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer cited her example in support of his deregulation plans. \"In the 1980s, the Thatcher government deregulated finance capitalâ€¦,\" he wrote in The Times, \"This is our equivalent.\" No British woman leader other than Elizabeth I has been the subject of so many plays and films, or impersonated by so many actors. The Iron Lady has been played by Meryl Streep, Gillian Anderson, Lindsay Duncan and Andrea Riseborough, among others. Harriet Walter takes the lead in the latest Channel 4 drama Brian and Maggie, which recreates a TV interview in which the real Thatcher confirmed to journalist Brian Walden that she did not believe in \"equality\". A year of anniversaries This is a big year for admirers - and detractors - of Thatcher. \n                  Kemi Badenoch after 100 days: A work in progress and her Farage problem\n                 \n                  Former Tory MP speaks from Ukraine after joining military following end of political career\n                 \n                  Conservatives pledge to tighten immigration rules in Reform fightback\n                 This October marks 100 years since her birth in Grantham, Lincolnshire, the daughter of a grocer. The Westminster thinktank Policy Exchange is launching The Thatcher Centenary Project. This week it held its inaugural meeting marking an equally important Thatcher anniversary: 50 years since she became the leader of the Conservative Party. On 5 February 1979, Thatcher scored a surprise victory over the incumbent Ted Heath in the first round of the Conservative leadership election, winning the votes of 130 MPs to Heath's 119. Sir Hugh Fraser MP, husband of the glamorous author Lady Antonia Fraser, also ran, garnering 16 votes. Heath was out. He had been elected prime minister in 1970 and took the UK into the European Community, but after an economically damaging period of confrontation with trade unions, he was defeated in two general elections in 1974. In the second round on 11 February 1975, she was elected leader of the opposition by a majority knock-out, 146 votes to 79 for Willie Whitelaw, 19 each for Jim Prior and Geoffrey Howe, and 11 for John Peyton. She became the first female leader of a major British political party. Four years later she beat Labour's Jim Callaghan in the general election to become Britain's first woman prime minister. She would go on to win two further elections, and be prime minister for 11 years, until she was forced out by her party in the autumn of 1990 - a fate she put down to \"treachery\". 'We need impact' That was more than 30 years ago and does not explain why she is still such a potent icon today, both hated and revered. The explanation lies partly in the way in which her policies transformed Britain, partly in her political success and partly in the force of her character. As she wrote in a letter to her daughter Carol: \"Brain power is not enough. We need personality and impact as well.\" I started to cover British politics from about 1983 and interviewed Mrs Thatcher quite often. She was great to talk to because she engaged, even with a young reporter, and seemed to enjoy being challenged while arguing her position with conviction. In her later years in Downing Street, she lost this openness and ability to respond to those who disagreed with her. Months before her downfall, I remember the cabinet minister Chris Patten complaining: \"She'll have to go. She's stopped listening.\" In foreign affairs, her years in power included a military victory to retake the Falkland Islands, a genuinely special relationship with US president Ronald Reagan, detente with Mikhail Gorbachev as the Soviet Union imploded and an increasingly sceptical approach to membership of what became the European Union. At home, Sir Keir is still praising her for the \"meaningful change\" she made to Britain/he and Rachel Reeves are trying on her clothes as they try to emulate her efforts to \"drag Britain out of its stupor by letting loose our natural entrepreneurialism\". This prime minister is now looking to the private sector to provide homes and build infrastructure. The milk snatcher Thatcher's former speechwriter John O'Sullivan views her election as Tory leader as \"the first big victory for radical Conservatism\". She set about selling off council houses to create a \"property-owning democracy\" and began privatisation of many nationalised industries. There was a widescale deindustrialisation of Britain's traditional heavy industries and simultaneous deregulation which led to a boom in the services and financial sector. She confronted trade union power and defeated the National Union of Mineworkers' strike. Unsurprisingly, she became a hate figure to many on the centre and left of British politics. At my children's primary school in the 1980s and '90s there was a playground rhyme about \"Margaret Thatcher milk snatcher\", a reference to the cancellation of free milk for school children during her time as Heath's education secretary. There is a song \"Merry Christmas Maggie Thatcher/ We all celebrate today /'Cause it's one day closer to your death\" in 2005's Billy Liar The Musical. The audience voted to keep it in when she died in 2013. Disciples of the Iron Lady Thatcher's legacy has been complicated for Conservative politicians. They continue to argue over whether Thatcher in her prime would have been a leave or remain voter in the 2016 referendum. Read more:Obituary of the Iron LadyThatcher refused to share flight with pandaThirty years on from Thatcher's No10 exit She campaigned to join the EEC, enjoyed sparring with Brussels as prime minister, but became a bitter critic in her post-Downing Street decline. Her immediate successor, John Major, built on Thatcherite policies but was heavily critical of her behaviour as a self-declared \"back seat driver\". Tory leaders since Major have all claimed to be her disciples. From cold to warm in Labour land On the Labour side, attitudes have generally warmed up over the years. Neil Kinnock, the Labour leader who was beaten by Thatcher in 1992 and 1997, insists that the only thing he admires about her is her success as a woman. John Smith challenged her economic approach. Tony Blair invited her for a private discussion in Number 10 soon after his general election victory and continued to treat her with wary respect. Gordon Brown went further. He welcomed the then 81-year-old to tea in Downing Street and told journalists: \"I admire Lady Thatcherâ€¦ I am a conviction politician like her.\" On her death, Ed Miliband paid tribute to a woman who \"broke the mould\". Jeremy Corbyn, the left-winger who led Labour between 2015 and 2020, was the exception. He stuck by the barbs he had aimed at prime minister Thatcher when he was a backbench Labour MP: \"Every week, I speak to renters threatened with eviction. Homeless people struggling to survive. Parents using food banks. Elderly people who can't afford heating. That is the legacy of Thatcherism. We will never achieve meaningful change until it ends for good.\" Today Sir Keir is happy to strike Thatcherite poses. Ironically, while some Conservatives are celebrating Thatcher this year, other Tories want to move on. Kwasi Kwarteng, who served briefly as Liz Truss's \"kamikaze\" chancellor, chose this anniversary year to warn \"modern politicians\" that \"they should not indulge in a grotesque cosplay of an idealised Thatcher who only ever existed in their imagination\". The debate is as lively as ever about Thatcher and her legacy. She is not forgotten - whether people actually knew her when she was alive or not. One thing everyone agrees on is that she always enjoyed a good argument, until her declining years. With Churchill and Blair she is one of the most memorable British prime ministers of her century and her much-disputed political soul goes marching on into the next one."

Sky News has learnt that executives from companies including Barclays, HSBC, Lloyds Banking Group, NatWest and Nationwide have been asked to attend a meeting with Ms Reeves on Wednesday. The talks have been convened to discuss Labour's financial services growth strategy - one of the pillars of the wider industrial strategy being drawn up by ministers.

        "Content": "\n          Wales reporter\n              @TomosGruffydd\n Residents who live near disused coal tips in South Wales say lessons have not been learned from the Aberfan disaster nearly 60 years on. Their comments come after a disused coal tip in Cwmtillery, Blaenau Gwent, partially collapsed in November, forcing around 40 homes to be evacuated. A coal tip is made up of waste material from coal mining, many of which have existed for several decades.  Dianne Morgan, 68, has lived in the house she had built in the Cwmtillery ward for the last 10 years. She told Sky News she didn't know there was a category D tip - the most dangerous - behind her property, until the slip, which happened after heavy rainfall during Storm Bert. \"All we were told was underlying mines had been there. But there was no mention of a tip when we had searches at all,\" she said. \"I'm not being funny, if I had known there was a tip behind me, I wouldn't have built here.\" \n                  Charlene Hobbs: Fresh appeal for information about missing mum as new CCTV released\n                 \n                  Colin Richards death: 18-year-old Corey Gauci denies murder of father-of-seven\n                 \n                  Sophia Kelemen: Man in court over baby's death after she was hit by car\n                 'Got to be sorted' There are 2,573 disused coal tips in Wales, according to Welsh government data - the vast majority of which are in the former coal mining communities of the South Wales Valleys. Three hundred and sixty of these are in the two most dangerous categories and are monitored at least once a year as they have \"the potential to impact public safety\". Ms Morgan said she believes lessons have not been learned from the Aberfan disaster in 1966 when a colliery spoil tip collapsed killing 144 people, including 116 children. A build-up of water within the tip after heavy rain caused it to suddenly slide downhill as slurry. The tragedy is considered the worst mining-related disaster in British history and was more recently featured in an episode of Netflix series The Crown. \"The tip's got to come down,\" she said, but added that the authorities \"don't want to pay\". \"They think they'll just drag it on and on and on and then people just forget, but you're not going to forget are you? Because every time we have pouring down rain or if you hear a noise, you come out here and I have a check just in case it's something,\" she added. \"They all talk about they're all broke, ain't we all? But that doesn't matter, it's people's lives you're dealing with and people's homes at the end of the day. \"It took everything we had to build this, if that came down and wrecked this, even if I wasn't in it, we've got nothing.\" She said the slip before Christmas \"could have been a lot worse\". \"Irrespective of who owns it, it's got to be sorted...'cause you don't know where it's going to come down next',\" Ms Morgan said. \"We've got to have a surety that this tip is going to be seen to, and not only this tip but other tips for other people that could be in the same situation that we are, especially with the rain we're having at the moment.\" 'Nothing getting done' Brian Preece, 77, has lived in Cwmtillery all his life. He told Sky News he \"always played on the tips\" as a child. \"We never had one inclination from anywhere in my life that them tips was dangerous,\" he said. \"I played on them myself, my children played on them, my grandchildren, my great-grandchildren.\" He said that if a larger tip would have come down, his street \"would have gone\" and the tips needed to be taken \"down to a safe level\". \"They've said they was going to do this, and they said they was going to do that, but there's nothing getting done and everybody's worrying now,\" he added. \"The only safe way on my behalf, and I'm sure everybody else, is they should be dropped. \"Alright, they say it's going to cost a lot of money, [but] they've got to drop it. You can't put a price on children's lives, on anybody's life, and it should be down.\" Sky News has approached Blaenau Gwent Council for its response. 'Nothing has changed' In October, Chancellor Rachel Reeves announced Â£25m in the budget for the maintenance of coal tips in Wales to ensure communities are kept \"safe\". Meanwhile, the Welsh government has outlined proposals for a Disused Tips Authority for Wales, which would take on responsibility for coal tip safety in future. But campaigners say the money promised to tackle the issue is not enough. Stuart Adams, 65, regularly walks the tips at Bedwas and Cilfynydd. Mr Adams is part of the Clear South Wales's Coal Tips group, which is calling for action to make the tips safer. \"It's ordinary people that are going to be affected if there is a disaster, or even a minor slip, which has just happened in Cwmtillery. They still cause masses of disruption for people,\" he told Sky News. \"I'm no expert on the financial side of things, but clearly [the money's] not enough to make these places safe.\" Mr Adams said the tip at Cilfynydd Common collapsed in 1939 and was seen as \"a precursor to an Aberfan disaster\". \"Luckily no one was hurt, and no one was killed [in the 1939 slip],\" he added. \"The same could quite easily happen again as nothing has changed with regards to the tips.\" 'First of its kind' legislation A Welsh government spokesperson said it had invested more than Â£100m in coal tip safety since 2021 \"to ensure our coal tip communities are safe\". \"We have also introduced modern legislation - the first of its kind in the UK - to prevent disused coal and non-coal tips from being a threat to human life,\" they added. \"The highest risk coal tips (category C and D) are regularly inspected by the Mining Remediation Authority (MRA) and we continue to work with partners across Wales to inspect sites, including additional checks during extreme weather.\" A spokesperson for the MRA (formerly the Coal Authority) said it continued to provide \"support, expertise and advice\" to the Welsh government. \"We undertake an inspection programme on behalf of Welsh government and other agencies, providing recommendations for maintenance requirements,\" they added. \"We also continue to directly manage the 26 coal tips that the Mining Remediation Authority owns in Wales and provide management services to other landowners as needed.\""

It comes after the US rapper, also known as Ye, appeared to write a barrage of posts on his social media account, making offensive comments, including about Jewish people. Many of the musician's X posts on Friday centred on the Jewish community, the most severe of which said \"I love Hitler\" and \"I'm a Nazi\". Another post said: \"I'm never apologising for my Jewish comments.\" On Saturday, Schwimmer, who is Jewish, urged Mr Musk to remove West from X because of his \"hate-filled, ignorant bile\". The US actor said on his Instagram account: \"This is so 2022. \"We can't stop a deranged bigot from spewing hate filled, ignorant bileâ€¦ but we CAN stop giving him a megaphone, Mr. Musk. \n                  Which celebrities are attending Donald Trump's inauguration?\n                 \n                  Kanye West accused of sexual assault on set of music video in new lawsuit\n                 \n                  Kanye West and Adidas reach settlement after years of lawsuits\n                 \"Kanye West has 32.7 million followers on your platform, X.

A while later, West was posting more offensive comments about Jewish people. The Campaign Against Antisemitism has also called for Mr Musk to remove West from X.

West has had his X account suspended at least twice in the past. It was suspended in December 2022 after he made antisemitic comments and praised Hitler. Mr Musk said at the time the account would be suspended after he posted an image that appeared to show a swastika inside a Star of David. Mr Musk said the suspension was \"for incitement to violence\". The account was unsuspended by July 2023. In October 2022, West's account was restricted over antisemitic comments but he returned to the platform the following month. In that case, he also made antisemitic remarks that led to Adidas cutting ties with the rapper."

        "Content": "\n          Entertainment reporter\n              @Debbie_Ridgard\n Jack Rooke says he does not want to revisit the Big Boys story again once season three is out. The Bafta award-winning writer based the Channel 4 series on his university experience in the 2010s while he explored his sexuality for the first time and learned to live with the grief from his father's death. Speaking to Sky News, he says although the drama comedy received a great reaction from fans and critics, he does not imagine ever returning to it for a reboot or spin-off. \"I know everyone always wants to leave the door open. I think there's something so brilliant, a special moment here to just celebrate something being exactly what it is,\" he says. \"It's a succinct story that has a beginning and an end in the final episode of Big Boys, the last two episodes I wrote kind of almost run one into another. It's like a two-part ending.\" He adds: \"I just think there's something about leaving them. Every single character by the end of their series, their story is tied up, and I'm proud of that as a writer because it's quite difficult to try and give everyone an ending. But I think we've done that.\" That decision does not mean he wants to leave his cast behind, in fact, he says he already has a goal in mind. \"I'm really up for writing something completely different that has exactly the same cast. I would like to write like a completely different story. Completely fictional, completely oddball, completely weird, but have the whole gang in there again playing completely different parts,\" he says. \"One day I'd like to write Dylan [Llewellyn] as a real nasty villain. No more sweethearts from the 'wee English fella' [from Derry Girls]. I want him to play like someone quite bloodthirsty.\" Read more from Sky News:Friends star calls on Elon Musk to ban Kanye West from XOasis fans say Ticketmaster cancelled orders over 'bot' claimsDemi Moore continues winning streak at Critics Choice Awards Season one and two of Big Boys followed Jack, played by Derry Girls star Llewellyn, a shy 19-year-old student moving a short distance away from his mother for the first time to start his new life at Brent University. Sharing accommodation with Danny, Sweetpea actor Jon Pointing, the pair quickly form a close bond and begin to navigate through their lives together. Llewellyn says he will look back proudly at what the cast and crew achieved with the series, showing young people finding their footing and pride in themselves. \"I think that the dynamic between Jack and Danny is something you don't see very often - a gay guy and a straight guy having that friendship, having that bond,\" he says. \"You don't see it enough on TV, I don't think. And yet you have it every day, you have it like in real life so why isn't it on TV, you know?\" For those who may not have watched a full episode yet, they have more than likely stumbled upon one of its most poignant scenes. The moment the character Jack made the decision to tell his mother he's gay featured on Celebrity Gogglebox and quickly went viral on social media. Rooke says the appearance on Gogglebox was huge for the show, but it was also special to have a moment about his mother and late father resonate with people. \"People call it a coming out scene but to me, every line in that scene was about grief. It was about loss. It was about when you can't tell someone who is no longer with you something so huge about yourself, but you can still tell the people who are there and who are going to love and support you, whatever,\" he says. \"So, I think that scene to me is always going to be really close to my heart. And the three of them performed their socks off in that moment.\" The 31-year-old says he is slightly apprehensive about how he has decided to finish the acclaimed show. \"There is a scene in episode six of series three, and even just the last two minutes of that episode, the last two minutes of Big Boys, to me, I feel like that is the show. It's about 'chosen family' and people who pick you up when you are at your lowest and I think that's the sort of legacy of the show,\" he says. \"It's always about the people we choose, and I know that the concept of chosen family isn't a new thing, but I don't think you can ever be reminded enough how important that is, especially right now in the current climate we're in. It is about saying 'we' first.\" He adds: \"It's a risk some people might not like the ending of this show [sic]. I think we've taken a bit of a riskier end to this but that feels truer and more authentic and will hopefully resonate with people.\" Big Boys season three airs on Channel 4 at 10pm on Sunday 9 February."
