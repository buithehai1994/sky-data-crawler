        "Content": " Sir Keir Starmer has warned China poses \"real national security threats to the United Kingdom\" - and hit out at Brexit. During a speech at the Guildhall in London, the prime minister said \"wild promises\" made to the British people ahead of the referendum have been unfulfilled. \"How it was sold and delivered was simply wrong,\" he added. \"We are still dealing with the consequences today.\" Sir Keir argued it would be \"utterly reckless\" to consider Brexit as a template for future foreign policy - and attacked politicians who have a \"corrosive, inward-looking attitude\". He singled out Kemi Badenoch and Nigel Farage, who have both called for the UK to leave the European Convention on Human Rights - and Zack Polanski, who wants to leave NATO. Such attitudes \"offer grievance rather than hope\", the PM said - accusing them of having \"a declinist vision of a lesser Britain, not a Great Britain\". Although Sir Keir opposed Brexit when in Opposition, he stressed that the vote to leave \"was a fair, democratic expression, and I will always respect that\". He told the Lady Mayor's Banquet that Labour has made \"a decisive move to face outward again and build our power, both hard and soft, which had been so damaged and neglected\". 'Protecting our security is non-negotiable' Elsewhere in the speech, the prime minister warned the UK needs a policy towards China that recognises the national security threat it poses. He said: \"For years we have blown hot and cold. We had the 'Golden Age', which then flipped to an 'Ice Age'. We reject that binary choice. \"So our response will not be driven by fear, nor softened by illusion. It will be grounded in strength, clarity and sober realism.\" China has been a major issue in Westminster of late following accusations of spying in parliament, and controversy over the new \"super embassy\" that Beijing wants to build in central London. Chief political correspondent The China hawks like Iain Duncan Smith, Tom Tugendhat and others on the Conservative benches - and indeed Reform - won't like this one little bit. A large part of this speech was devoted to China, and he did talk about the twin-track approach: being tough on national security, but at the same time talking to the Chinese. He bemoaned the fact that a British prime minister hadn't talked to the Chinese premier since Theresa May in February 2018. This was probably the most wide-ranging, perhaps most significant foreign policy speech we've heard from Sir Keir Starmer. It comes against the backdrop of all the political turmoil over the budget, but it was a serious speech. It will please those who want to see the UK taking a much more interventionist approach rather than isolationist. His supporters will like what they've heard here - but not China hawks and Brexiteers. However, Sir Keir defended plans to visit China in the new year - and said an absence of engagement with the world's second-biggest economy would be \"staggering\" and a \"dereliction of duty\". He described it as \"a nation of immense scale, ambition, and ingenuity\" and a \"defining force in technology, trade and global governance\". 'Huge' opportunities for businesses Setting out his own approach, Sir Keir explained: \"This is not a question of balancing economic and security considerations. We don't trade off security in one area, for a bit more economic access somewhere else. \"Protecting our security is non-negotiable - our first duty. But by taking tough steps to keep us secure, we enable ourselves to cooperate in other areas.\" The PM added that he wants to give businesses \"the confidence, clarity, and support\" to win opportunities in China. \"In areas like financial and professional services, creative industries, pharmaceuticals, luxury goods and more - Great British success stories - the export opportunities are huge, and we will back you to seize them,\" he said.  'Starmer continues to kowtow to China' Sky News understands the prime minister is set to approve plans for a controversial Chinese \"super embassy\" in central London. A final decision on the planning application for the former Royal Mint site near the Tower of London is due on 10 December after repeated delays. Concerns were previously raised after Beijing's planning application featured blacked-out areas. Since he was elected last year, Sir Keir has been active on the world stage, trumpeting deals with the US, India, and the EU and leading the \"coalition of the willing\" in support of Ukraine. But he has also faced criticism from his opponents, who accuse him of spending too much time out of the UK attending international summits rather than focusing on domestic issues. Read more:MI5 spying warning aims to send signal to China'Many options' on table for Venezuela Responding to the prime minister's speech, shadow foreign secretary Dame Priti Patel said: \"From China's continued flouting of economic rules to transnational repression of Hong Kongers in Britain, Starmer's 'reset' with Beijing is a naive one-way street, which puts Britain at risk while Beijing gets everything it wants. \"Starmer continues to kowtow to China and is captivated by half-baked promises of trade. \"Coming just days after the latest Chinese plot to interfere in our democracy was exposed, his love letter to the Chinese Communist Party is a desperate ploy to generate economic growth following his budget of lies and is completely ill-judged. \"While China poses a clear threat to Britain, China continues to back Iran and Russia, and plots to undermine our institutions. Keir Starmer has become Beijing's useful idiot in Britain.\""

        "Content": "\n          Political reporter\n              @alixculbertson\n The chairman of the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) has resigned after an investigation into the leak of last week's budget criticised the watchdog's leadership. Richard Hughes stepped down following the publication of a report into the early release of Rachel Reeves's fiscal event. The OBR's official forecast, which revealed the contents of the record-breaking tax rise budget, was accessed at 11.35am last Wednesday, about an hour before the chancellor stood up to deliver it. Latest updates from the Politics Hub In a letter to Ms Reeves and the chairwoman of the Commons Treasury Committee Dame Meg Hillier, Mr Hughes said he was quitting to allow the OBR to \"quickly move on from this regrettable incident\". He said he took \"full responsibility\" for \"the shortcomings identified in the report\". Mr Hughes said: \"By implementing the recommendations in this report, I am certain the OBR can quickly regain and restore the confidence and esteem that it has earned through 15 years of rigorous, independent economic analysis.\" \n                  PM issues China warning - and hits out at Brexit\n                 \n                  Is Starmer continuing to mislead public over the budget?\n                 \n                  US and UK agree zero tariffs on pharmaceuticals\n                 An investigation ordered by the independent fiscal forecaster soon after the budget called the leak \"the worst failure in the 15-year history of the OBR\" and strongly criticised the watchdog's processes for protecting sensitive information. The probe found there was \"nothing to suggest\" the premature access was the result of \"hostile cyber activity by foreign actors or cyber criminals, or of connivance by anyone working for the OBR\". \"Nor was it simply a matter of pressing the publication button on a locally managed website too early,\" the report stated. It concluded that \"configuration errors\" led to \"a failure to ensure the protections which hide documents from public view immediately before publication were in place\". \"The ultimate responsibility for the circumstances in which this vulnerability occurred and was then exposed rests, over the years, with the leadership of the OBR,\" the investigation said.  Kemi Badenoch claimed that Ms Reeves was trying to use Mr Hughes as a \"human shield\". The Conservative leader said on social media: \"More serious questions for the chancellor as she tries to make Richard Hughes her human shield. \"Her actions have turned this into a full blown political crisis for the government. If [Prime Minister] Keir Starmer had a backbone, he would have sacked Reeves long ago.\" Mr Hughes had been under pressure to explain the leak, which he immediately apologised for, and ordered the investigation. It is also led by Professor David Miles and Tom Josephs, with Baroness Sarah Hogg and Dame Susan Rice as non-executive members. There are 52 permanent staff, who are civil servants, with six of those working on the strategy, operations and communications team. The report acknowledged the leak \"changed the pattern of budget day to the chancellor's disadvantage\".

And it said last week's budget forecast document had multiple attempts to access it before it was inadvertently made accessible online. The investigation partly blamed the Treasury and the Cabinet Office, as the OBR's IT services were moved on to the Treasury's shared systems in 2023 to \"align more closely with Treasury security arrangements\", particularly around the sharing of sensitive budget information between the OBR and Treasury. It said the Treasury should pay \"greater attention\" when setting the OBR's budget, currently £6.4m, to the need for adequate support. The investigation said there was pressure on the small team involved to ensure the full economic and fiscal outlook was published when the chancellor sat down after giving her budget, so a pre-publication \"facility\" was used. But this commonly used device created a \"potential vulnerability if not configured properly\" and had not received the same amount of attention by the OBR as it had placed on security of communications with the Treasury \"during the long period of run-up to the budget\".  An outside web developer, who has helped the OBR team since it came into existence 15 years ago, assists the internal team and manages content and uploads at times of pressure, including the release of the budget forecast. The report said the risks of this approach have increased over the years as technologies have developed and online threats have risen. \"With hindsight, it is clear that over the years this arrangement should have been regularly reexamined and assessed by the management of the OBR,\" the report said. It recommended the process for publishing forecasts should \"immediately\" be removed from the OBR's locally managed website, which is a WordPress website, and published as part of a government website."

        "Content": "\n          Economics and data editor\n              @EdConwaySky\n  Did the chancellor mislead the public, and her own cabinet, before the budget? It's a good question, and we'll come to it in a second, but let's begin with an even bigger one: is the prime minister continuing to mislead the public over the budget? The details are a bit complex but ultimately this all comes back to a rather simple question: why did the government raise taxes in last week's budget? To judge from the prime minister's responses at a news conference just this morning, you might have judged that the answer is: \"because we had to\". \"There was an OBR productivity review,\" he explained to one journalist. \"The result of that was there was £16bn less than we might otherwise have had. That's a difficult starting point for any budget.\" Politics latest: OBR boss resigns over budget leak  Time and time again throughout the news conference, he repeated the same point: the Office for Budget Responsibility had revised its forecasts for the UK economy and the upshot of that was that the government had a £16bn hole in its accounts. Keep that figure in your head for a bit, because it's not without significance. But for the time being, let's take a step back and recall that budgets are mostly about the difference between two numbers: revenues and expenditure; tax and spending. This government has set itself a fiscal rule - that it needs, within a few years, to ensure that, after netting out investment, the tax bar needs to be higher than the spending bar. At the time of the last budget, taxes were indeed higher than current spending, once the economic cycle is taken account of or, to put it in economists' language, there was a surplus in the cyclically adjusted current budget. The chancellor had met her fiscal rule, by £9.9bn. This, it's worth saying, is not a very large margin by which to meet your fiscal rule. A typical budget can see revisions and changes that would swamp that in one fell swoop. And part of the explanation for why there has been so much speculation about tax rises over the summer is that the chancellor left herself so little \"headroom\" against the rule. And since everyone could see debt interest costs were going up, it seemed quite plausible that the government would have to raise taxes. Then, over the summer, the OBR, whose job it is to make the official government forecasts, and to mark its fiscal homework, told the government it was also doing something else: reviewing the state of Britain's productivity. This set alarm bells ringing in Downing Street - and understandably. The weaker productivity growth is, the less income we're all earning, and the less income we're earning, the less tax revenues there are going into the exchequer. The early signs were that the productivity review would knock tens of billions of pounds off the chancellor's \"headroom\" - that it could, in one fell swoop, wipe off that £9.9bn and send it into the red. Read more:Main budget announcements - at a glanceEnter your salary to see how the budget affects you That is why stories began to brew through the summer that the chancellor was considering raising taxes. The Treasury was preparing itself for some grisly news. But here's the interesting thing: when the bad news (that productivity review) did eventually arrive, it was far less grisly than expected. True: the one-off productivity \"hit\" to the public finances was £16bn. But - and this is crucial - that was offset by a lot of other, much better news (at least from the exchequer's perspective). Higher wage inflation meant higher expected tax revenues, not to mention a host of other impacts. All told, when everything was totted up, the hit to the public finances wasn't £16bn but somewhere between £5bn and £6bn.  Why is that number significant? Because it's short of the chancellor's existing £9.9bn headroom. Or, to put it another way, the OBR's forecasting exercise was not enough to force her to raise taxes. The decision to raise taxes, in other words, came down to something else. It came down to the fact that the government U-turned on a number of its welfare reforms over the summer. It came down to the fact that they wanted to axe the two-child benefits cap. And, on top of this, it came down to the fact that they wanted to raise their \"headroom\" against the fiscal rules from £9.9bn to over £20bn. These are all perfectly logical reasons to raise tax - though some will disagree on their wisdom. But here's the key thing: they are the chancellor and prime minister's decisions. They are not knee-jerk responses to someone else's bad news. Yet when the prime minister explained his budget decisions, he focused mostly on that OBR report. In fact, worse, he selectively quoted the £16bn number from the productivity review without acknowledging that it was only one part of the story. That seems pretty misleading to me."

        "Content": "\n          Chief North of England correspondent\n              @GregMilamSky\n The police watchdog will today publish its report into the actions of officers during and after the Hillsborough disaster in 1989. The Independent Office for Police Misconduct (IOPC) has been investigating South Yorkshire Police since 2012. It is the largest independent investigation into alleged police misconduct and criminality ever carried out in England and Wales. Hillsborough remains to this day the worst disaster in British sporting history. How did we get here? A crush on the terraces during the FA Cup semi-final at the stadium in Sheffield resulted in the death of 97 Liverpool fans - men, women, and children aged from 10 to 67. Even as fans lay dying, police were claiming that Liverpool supporters, arriving in large numbers late, drunk and without tickets, caused the disaster. But after decades of campaigning, that narrative was debunked. In April 2016, new inquests - held after the original verdicts of accidental death were quashed in 2012 - determined that those who died had been unlawfully killed. The IOPC told victims' families in March that no officers would face misconduct proceedings because legislation in place at the time did not require police to have a duty of candour. Dozens of allegations of misconduct against officers had been upheld, it said, but none would face disciplinary proceedings because they had all left the police service. What has this probe looked at? The IOPC investigation focused on amendments made in accounts of officers who were present at Hillsborough and allegations that misleading information was passed by the police to the media, MPs, parliament, and the inquiries set up immediately after the disaster. It has also been looking into the role of West Midlands Police, which led the investigation into the disaster, and allegations that family members and campaigners were subject to surveillance by the police. The IOPC has already confirmed that its investigation \"aligned\" with the findings of the Hillsborough Independent Panel investigation and the 2016 inquests. It said: \"We found no evidence to support police accounts to the media, the Taylor Inquiry and both sets of inquests, which suggested that the behaviour of supporters caused or in any way contributed to the disaster.\" Read more from Sky News:PM emotional talking about HillsboroughLong-awaited Hillsborough Law introducedOfficer cleared of gross negligence manslaughter In September, the government introduced the so-called Hillsborough Law to the House of Commons.

        "Content": " Nicolas Maduro has said Venezuelans are ready to defend their country as the US considers a land attack. The president held a rally in Caracas amid heightened tensions with Donald Trump's administration, which has been targeting what it says are boats carrying drug smugglers. Mr Trump met his national security team on Monday evening, having warned last week that land strikes would start \"very soon\". It's not been confirmed what was discussed at the meeting, but White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters: \"There's many options at the president's disposal that are on the table - and I'll let him speak on those.\" US forces have carried out at least 21 strikes on boats it claims were carrying narcotics to its shores over the last few months, and the White House has accused Mr Maduro of being involved in the drugs trade - a claim he denies.  'Psychological terrorism' Mr Maduro - widely considered a dictator by the West - said on Monday that Venezuelans are ready \"to defend [the country] and lead it to the path of peace\". \n                  A shooting on the streets of Washington DC\n                 \n                  Venezuela: Maduro brandishes sword and vows to defy any US attempt to overthrow his government \n                 \n                  Several airlines cancel Venezuela flights after 'hazardous situation' warning\n                 \"We have lived through 22 weeks of aggression that can only be described as psychological terrorism,\" he said. Venezuela has said the boat attacks, which have killed more than 80 people, amount to murder - and that Mr Trump's true motivation is to oust Mr Maduro and access its oil. Concerns have been raised over the legality of the US attacks, which the Pentagon has sought to justify by designating the gangs as foreign terror organisations. Controversy over US strikes Tensions remain high over America's large deployment in the Caribbean Sea and eastern Pacific, which includes its flagship aircraft carrier and thousands of troops. The US has released videos of boats being blown up but has not provided evidence - such as photos of drugs - to support the smuggling claims. Controversy also surrounds the first incident, on 2 September, in which 11 people were killed - with a follow-up strike targeting the boat after the first attack left two survivors in the water. US media reported defence secretary Pete Hegseth gave an order that everyone on board should be killed. However, there are concerns about the legality of the second strike if the survivors posed no threat. Mr Hegseth dismissed the reporting as \"fake news\" and insisted all actions in the region are compliant with US and international law. \"Every trafficker we kill is affiliated with a Designated Terrorist Organization,\" he said on X.  Mr Trump said on Sunday he would not have wanted a second strike and that Mr Hegseth had denied giving such an order. Ms Leavitt confirmed on Monday that the boat had been hit by a second strike - but denied Mr Hegseth gave the order for the follow-up. Instead, she said he had authorised US navy vice admiral Frank Bradley to attack, and the admiral acted \"well within his authority and the law, directing the engagement to ensure the boat was destroyed and the threat to the US was eliminated\". Read more from Sky News:Hong Kong fire: 13 arrested as death toll hits 151More than 1,100 confirmed dead in Asia floods  As the US weighs its next steps, Mr Trump said on Sunday he had spoken to Mr Maduro by phone and that the conversation went neither \"well or badly\". In recent days, he also stated that Venezuela's airspace should be considered closed - with the South American nation calling it a \"colonial threat\" and \"illegal, and unjustified aggression\"."

        "Content": "The White House has revealed details of Donald Trump's recent medical evaluation involving a scan of his cardiovascular system and abdomen. The US president, 79, underwent a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan in October, which was confirmed in a memo from his doctor, Sean P Barbabella. The White House physician wrote that the cardiovascular and abdominal imaging was \"perfectly normal\". \"The purpose of this imaging is preventive: to identify issues early, confirm overall health, and ensure he maintains long-term vitality and function,\" said Dr Barbabella. He added that there was \"no evidence of arterial narrowing impairing blood flow or abnormalities in the heart or major vessels\". \"The heart chambers are normal in size, the vessel walls appear smooth and health, and there are no signs of inflammation, or clotting.\" As for the abdominal imaging, he wrote that \"all major organs appear very healthy and well-perfused\". \n                  Venezuela accuses Trump of 'colonial threat,' after US president 'closes' its airspace \n                 \n                  Trump says he will cancel all Biden executive orders 'signed with autopen'\n                 \n                  Suspect in US National Guard shooting now facing first-degree murder charge\n                 \"Everything evaluated is functioning within normal limits with no acute or chronic concerns.\" He said the imaging was done \"because men in his age group benefit from a thorough evaluation of cardiovascular and abdominal health\". While speaking to reporters on Sunday, the US president said he didn't know what part of his body was examined but added: \"It wasn't the brain because I took a cognitive test and I aced it.\" He described the results of the MRI as \"perfect\".

Dr Barbabella said CVI, which causes blood to pool in the veins, was a \"benign and common condition, particularly in individuals over the age of 70\". Concerns were also raised in July about photos which showed bruising on the back of Mr Trump's hand that had been covered with make-up.

        "Content": " Sir Keir Starmer has warned China poses \"real national security threats to the United Kingdom\" - and hit out at Brexit. During a speech at the Guildhall in London, the prime minister said \"wild promises\" made to the British people ahead of the referendum have been unfulfilled. \"How it was sold and delivered was simply wrong,\" he added. \"We are still dealing with the consequences today.\" Sir Keir argued it would be \"utterly reckless\" to consider Brexit as a template for future foreign policy - and attacked politicians who have a \"corrosive, inward-looking attitude\". He singled out Kemi Badenoch and Nigel Farage, who have both called for the UK to leave the European Convention on Human Rights - and Zack Polanski, who wants to leave NATO. Such attitudes \"offer grievance rather than hope\", the PM said - accusing them of having \"a declinist vision of a lesser Britain, not a Great Britain\". Although Sir Keir opposed Brexit when in Opposition, he stressed that the vote to leave \"was a fair, democratic expression, and I will always respect that\". He told the Lady Mayor's Banquet that Labour has made \"a decisive move to face outward again and build our power, both hard and soft, which had been so damaged and neglected\". 'Protecting our security is non-negotiable' Elsewhere in the speech, the prime minister warned the UK needs a policy towards China that recognises the national security threat it poses. He said: \"For years we have blown hot and cold. We had the 'Golden Age', which then flipped to an 'Ice Age'. We reject that binary choice. \"So our response will not be driven by fear, nor softened by illusion. It will be grounded in strength, clarity and sober realism.\" China has been a major issue in Westminster of late following accusations of spying in parliament, and controversy over the new \"super embassy\" that Beijing wants to build in central London. Chief political correspondent The China hawks like Iain Duncan Smith, Tom Tugendhat and others on the Conservative benches - and indeed Reform - won't like this one little bit. A large part of this speech was devoted to China, and he did talk about the twin-track approach: being tough on national security, but at the same time talking to the Chinese. He bemoaned the fact that a British prime minister hadn't talked to the Chinese premier since Theresa May in February 2018. This was probably the most wide-ranging, perhaps most significant foreign policy speech we've heard from Sir Keir Starmer. It comes against the backdrop of all the political turmoil over the budget, but it was a serious speech. It will please those who want to see the UK taking a much more interventionist approach rather than isolationist. His supporters will like what they've heard here - but not China hawks and Brexiteers. However, Sir Keir defended plans to visit China in the new year - and said an absence of engagement with the world's second-biggest economy would be \"staggering\" and a \"dereliction of duty\". He described it as \"a nation of immense scale, ambition, and ingenuity\" and a \"defining force in technology, trade and global governance\". 'Huge' opportunities for businesses Setting out his own approach, Sir Keir explained: \"This is not a question of balancing economic and security considerations. We don't trade off security in one area, for a bit more economic access somewhere else. \"Protecting our security is non-negotiable - our first duty. But by taking tough steps to keep us secure, we enable ourselves to cooperate in other areas.\" The PM added that he wants to give businesses \"the confidence, clarity, and support\" to win opportunities in China. \"In areas like financial and professional services, creative industries, pharmaceuticals, luxury goods and more - Great British success stories - the export opportunities are huge, and we will back you to seize them,\" he said.  'Starmer continues to kowtow to China' Sky News understands the prime minister is set to approve plans for a controversial Chinese \"super embassy\" in central London. A final decision on the planning application for the former Royal Mint site near the Tower of London is due on 10 December after repeated delays. Concerns were previously raised after Beijing's planning application featured blacked-out areas. Since he was elected last year, Sir Keir has been active on the world stage, trumpeting deals with the US, India, and the EU and leading the \"coalition of the willing\" in support of Ukraine. But he has also faced criticism from his opponents, who accuse him of spending too much time out of the UK attending international summits rather than focusing on domestic issues. Read more:MI5 spying warning aims to send signal to China'Many options' on table for Venezuela Responding to the prime minister's speech, shadow foreign secretary Dame Priti Patel said: \"From China's continued flouting of economic rules to transnational repression of Hong Kongers in Britain, Starmer's 'reset' with Beijing is a naive one-way street, which puts Britain at risk while Beijing gets everything it wants. \"Starmer continues to kowtow to China and is captivated by half-baked promises of trade. \"Coming just days after the latest Chinese plot to interfere in our democracy was exposed, his love letter to the Chinese Communist Party is a desperate ploy to generate economic growth following his budget of lies and is completely ill-judged. \"While China poses a clear threat to Britain, China continues to back Iran and Russia, and plots to undermine our institutions. Keir Starmer has become Beijing's useful idiot in Britain.\""

        "Content": "\n          Political reporter\n              @alixculbertson\n The chairman of the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) has resigned after an investigation into the leak of last week's budget criticised the watchdog's leadership. Richard Hughes stepped down following the publication of a report into the early release of Rachel Reeves's fiscal event. The OBR's official forecast, which revealed the contents of the record-breaking tax rise budget, was accessed at 11.35am last Wednesday, about an hour before the chancellor stood up to deliver it. Latest updates from the Politics Hub In a letter to Ms Reeves and the chairwoman of the Commons Treasury Committee Dame Meg Hillier, Mr Hughes said he was quitting to allow the OBR to \"quickly move on from this regrettable incident\". He said he took \"full responsibility\" for \"the shortcomings identified in the report\". Mr Hughes said: \"By implementing the recommendations in this report, I am certain the OBR can quickly regain and restore the confidence and esteem that it has earned through 15 years of rigorous, independent economic analysis.\" \n                  PM issues China warning - and hits out at Brexit\n                 \n                  Is Starmer continuing to mislead public over the budget?\n                 \n                  US and UK agree zero tariffs on pharmaceuticals\n                 An investigation ordered by the independent fiscal forecaster soon after the budget called the leak \"the worst failure in the 15-year history of the OBR\" and strongly criticised the watchdog's processes for protecting sensitive information. The probe found there was \"nothing to suggest\" the premature access was the result of \"hostile cyber activity by foreign actors or cyber criminals, or of connivance by anyone working for the OBR\". \"Nor was it simply a matter of pressing the publication button on a locally managed website too early,\" the report stated. It concluded that \"configuration errors\" led to \"a failure to ensure the protections which hide documents from public view immediately before publication were in place\". \"The ultimate responsibility for the circumstances in which this vulnerability occurred and was then exposed rests, over the years, with the leadership of the OBR,\" the investigation said.  Kemi Badenoch claimed that Ms Reeves was trying to use Mr Hughes as a \"human shield\". The Conservative leader said on social media: \"More serious questions for the chancellor as she tries to make Richard Hughes her human shield. \"Her actions have turned this into a full blown political crisis for the government. If [Prime Minister] Keir Starmer had a backbone, he would have sacked Reeves long ago.\" Mr Hughes had been under pressure to explain the leak, which he immediately apologised for, and ordered the investigation. It is also led by Professor David Miles and Tom Josephs, with Baroness Sarah Hogg and Dame Susan Rice as non-executive members. There are 52 permanent staff, who are civil servants, with six of those working on the strategy, operations and communications team. The report acknowledged the leak \"changed the pattern of budget day to the chancellor's disadvantage\".

And it said last week's budget forecast document had multiple attempts to access it before it was inadvertently made accessible online. The investigation partly blamed the Treasury and the Cabinet Office, as the OBR's IT services were moved on to the Treasury's shared systems in 2023 to \"align more closely with Treasury security arrangements\", particularly around the sharing of sensitive budget information between the OBR and Treasury. It said the Treasury should pay \"greater attention\" when setting the OBR's budget, currently £6.4m, to the need for adequate support. The investigation said there was pressure on the small team involved to ensure the full economic and fiscal outlook was published when the chancellor sat down after giving her budget, so a pre-publication \"facility\" was used. But this commonly used device created a \"potential vulnerability if not configured properly\" and had not received the same amount of attention by the OBR as it had placed on security of communications with the Treasury \"during the long period of run-up to the budget\".  An outside web developer, who has helped the OBR team since it came into existence 15 years ago, assists the internal team and manages content and uploads at times of pressure, including the release of the budget forecast. The report said the risks of this approach have increased over the years as technologies have developed and online threats have risen. \"With hindsight, it is clear that over the years this arrangement should have been regularly reexamined and assessed by the management of the OBR,\" the report said. It recommended the process for publishing forecasts should \"immediately\" be removed from the OBR's locally managed website, which is a WordPress website, and published as part of a government website."

        "Content": "\n          Economics and data editor\n              @EdConwaySky\n  Did the chancellor mislead the public, and her own cabinet, before the budget? It's a good question, and we'll come to it in a second, but let's begin with an even bigger one: is the prime minister continuing to mislead the public over the budget? The details are a bit complex but ultimately this all comes back to a rather simple question: why did the government raise taxes in last week's budget? To judge from the prime minister's responses at a news conference just this morning, you might have judged that the answer is: \"because we had to\". \"There was an OBR productivity review,\" he explained to one journalist. \"The result of that was there was £16bn less than we might otherwise have had. That's a difficult starting point for any budget.\" Politics latest: OBR boss resigns over budget leak  Time and time again throughout the news conference, he repeated the same point: the Office for Budget Responsibility had revised its forecasts for the UK economy and the upshot of that was that the government had a £16bn hole in its accounts. Keep that figure in your head for a bit, because it's not without significance. But for the time being, let's take a step back and recall that budgets are mostly about the difference between two numbers: revenues and expenditure; tax and spending. This government has set itself a fiscal rule - that it needs, within a few years, to ensure that, after netting out investment, the tax bar needs to be higher than the spending bar. At the time of the last budget, taxes were indeed higher than current spending, once the economic cycle is taken account of or, to put it in economists' language, there was a surplus in the cyclically adjusted current budget. The chancellor had met her fiscal rule, by £9.9bn. This, it's worth saying, is not a very large margin by which to meet your fiscal rule. A typical budget can see revisions and changes that would swamp that in one fell swoop. And part of the explanation for why there has been so much speculation about tax rises over the summer is that the chancellor left herself so little \"headroom\" against the rule. And since everyone could see debt interest costs were going up, it seemed quite plausible that the government would have to raise taxes. Then, over the summer, the OBR, whose job it is to make the official government forecasts, and to mark its fiscal homework, told the government it was also doing something else: reviewing the state of Britain's productivity. This set alarm bells ringing in Downing Street - and understandably. The weaker productivity growth is, the less income we're all earning, and the less income we're earning, the less tax revenues there are going into the exchequer. The early signs were that the productivity review would knock tens of billions of pounds off the chancellor's \"headroom\" - that it could, in one fell swoop, wipe off that £9.9bn and send it into the red. Read more:Main budget announcements - at a glanceEnter your salary to see how the budget affects you That is why stories began to brew through the summer that the chancellor was considering raising taxes. The Treasury was preparing itself for some grisly news. But here's the interesting thing: when the bad news (that productivity review) did eventually arrive, it was far less grisly than expected. True: the one-off productivity \"hit\" to the public finances was £16bn. But - and this is crucial - that was offset by a lot of other, much better news (at least from the exchequer's perspective). Higher wage inflation meant higher expected tax revenues, not to mention a host of other impacts. All told, when everything was totted up, the hit to the public finances wasn't £16bn but somewhere between £5bn and £6bn.  Why is that number significant? Because it's short of the chancellor's existing £9.9bn headroom. Or, to put it another way, the OBR's forecasting exercise was not enough to force her to raise taxes. The decision to raise taxes, in other words, came down to something else. It came down to the fact that the government U-turned on a number of its welfare reforms over the summer. It came down to the fact that they wanted to axe the two-child benefits cap. And, on top of this, it came down to the fact that they wanted to raise their \"headroom\" against the fiscal rules from £9.9bn to over £20bn. These are all perfectly logical reasons to raise tax - though some will disagree on their wisdom. But here's the key thing: they are the chancellor and prime minister's decisions. They are not knee-jerk responses to someone else's bad news. Yet when the prime minister explained his budget decisions, he focused mostly on that OBR report. In fact, worse, he selectively quoted the £16bn number from the productivity review without acknowledging that it was only one part of the story. That seems pretty misleading to me."

Applied to the overall population, the findings suggest 1.5 million people will eat alone at Christmas, according to the charity. Dame Joanna said the \"silence can be deafening\" for those left isolated and called it \"a crisis hidden in plain sight\". The actor and campaigner is now joining other luminaries including Dame Judi Dench, Brian Cox and Miriam Margolyes to back Age UK's campaign against loneliness. The charity says its volunteers made more than 70,000 minutes' worth of calls to people during Christmas week last year and is urging people to donate. 'A tragedy we don't talk about enough' Age UK said it also supports coffee mornings and festive lunches to give lonely people the chance to enjoy in-person interaction. Dame Judi said: \"For so many older people, Christmas can be a time of silence - days without conversation or company.\" Succession star Brian Cox called the issue \"a tragedy we don't talk about enough\". He said: \"Far too many older people are left spending the season in silence, when it should be a time of warmth, connection and joy.\" Margolyes, of Harry Potter fame, added: \"Growing older shouldn't mean disappearing into the background, we need to be seen, heard and celebrated. \"That's what Age UK is striving for - they're changing how we perceive age.\" Read more:What counts as a white Christmas?CCTV shows festive thief The charity's chief executive, Paul Farmer, said: \"Your donation could bring comfort, friendship, and care to an older person facing loneliness this winter. \"From friendly, weekly calls to local lunch clubs, we're here to make sure no one spends winter alone. But we can't do it without you.\""

        "Content": "\n          Chief North of England correspondent\n              @GregMilamSky\n The police watchdog will today publish its report into the actions of officers during and after the Hillsborough disaster in 1989. The Independent Office for Police Misconduct (IOPC) has been investigating South Yorkshire Police since 2012. It is the largest independent investigation into alleged police misconduct and criminality ever carried out in England and Wales. Hillsborough remains to this day the worst disaster in British sporting history. How did we get here? A crush on the terraces during the FA Cup semi-final at the stadium in Sheffield resulted in the death of 97 Liverpool fans - men, women, and children aged from 10 to 67. Even as fans lay dying, police were claiming that Liverpool supporters, arriving in large numbers late, drunk and without tickets, caused the disaster. But after decades of campaigning, that narrative was debunked. In April 2016, new inquests - held after the original verdicts of accidental death were quashed in 2012 - determined that those who died had been unlawfully killed. The IOPC told victims' families in March that no officers would face misconduct proceedings because legislation in place at the time did not require police to have a duty of candour. Dozens of allegations of misconduct against officers had been upheld, it said, but none would face disciplinary proceedings because they had all left the police service. What has this probe looked at? The IOPC investigation focused on amendments made in accounts of officers who were present at Hillsborough and allegations that misleading information was passed by the police to the media, MPs, parliament, and the inquiries set up immediately after the disaster. It has also been looking into the role of West Midlands Police, which led the investigation into the disaster, and allegations that family members and campaigners were subject to surveillance by the police. The IOPC has already confirmed that its investigation \"aligned\" with the findings of the Hillsborough Independent Panel investigation and the 2016 inquests. It said: \"We found no evidence to support police accounts to the media, the Taylor Inquiry and both sets of inquests, which suggested that the behaviour of supporters caused or in any way contributed to the disaster.\" Read more from Sky News:PM emotional talking about HillsboroughLong-awaited Hillsborough Law introducedOfficer cleared of gross negligence manslaughter In September, the government introduced the so-called Hillsborough Law to the House of Commons.

        "Content": "Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor has been officially stripped of two more honours by the King. He is no longer a knight companion of the Order of the Garter and has also lost his status as a knight grand cross of the Royal Victorian Order. It's another formality in the King's effort to sideline his brother and show he's acting decisively over his controversial links to Jeffrey Epstein. The former prince has consistently denied allegations of sexual abuse and his accuser, Virginia Giuffre, took her own life this year. Official notice of the titles being revoked was published today in The Gazette, the official public record. Andrew had held the Order of the Garter title since 2006 and the Royal Victorian Order honour since 2011. He agreed to stop using those titles, as well as the Duke of York, in October, amid further claims over his friendship with Epstein, including an email raising doubts over when he cut ties with the paedophile, and the imminent publication of Ms Giuffre's memoir. \n                  Prince Andrew Way to be renamed - but council warns it won't be straightforward\n                 \n                  Starmer urges anyone with information on Epstein case to come forward - after Andrew misses Congress deadline\n                 \n                  'Silence speaks volumes': Andrew criticised by US politicians after missing interview deadline \n                 Andrew was stripped of his prince status days later amid the release of US court documents and claims Andrew tried to dig up dirt on Ms Giuffre through a police bodyguard. It was also announced he and his ex-wife, Sarah Ferguson, would move out of the palatial Royal Lodge in Windsor. Royal correspondent It's again a reminder of Andrew's dramatic fall from grace - but the paragraphs in the London Gazette are in some ways just the final rubber stamp. The language underlines this is the last step in the formal process that was set in motion on 30 October, when it was confirmed Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor was losing everything. The notice states: \"THE KING has directed that the appointment of Andrew Albert Christian Edward MOUNTBATTEN-WINDSOR… shall be cancelled and annulled\". The formality of it once again cloaks how personal this all is. One brother cancelling another. The phrase \"his name shall be erased\" feels particularly blunt when you consider the emotional impact on the family. Even though they ultimately decided action had to be taken and this, in the end, was the right thing to do.

President Trump has approved a Congress vote to release all remaining files on Epstein - but it's unclear when they will be published.  He gave the go-ahead amid unrelenting pressure to disclose what the government knew about Epstein, and claims his links with other powerful people were being covered up. The paedophile financier killed himself in a prison cell in 2019."

The storm, which as of 5pm UK time on Monday was about 20km (12 miles) off the coast of the state capital Chennai, has weakened into a \"deep depression\" and was expected to weaken further in the next few hours, weather officials said. Over a million affected in Indonesia More than 28,000 homes have been damaged in Indonesia, with 1.4 million people affected by torrential rains following a tropical storm that formed in the Malacca Strait. The country's president, Prabowo Subianto, called it a catastrophe and pledged to rebuild infrastructure as he visited the three affected provinces on Monday, where nearly 300,000 people have been displaced by the flooding.

I can only live near this one remaining wall,\" she said.

        "Content": " Nicolas Maduro has said Venezuelans are ready to defend their country as the US considers a land attack. The president held a rally in Caracas amid heightened tensions with Donald Trump's administration, which has been targeting what it says are boats carrying drug smugglers. Mr Trump met his national security team on Monday evening, having warned last week that land strikes would start \"very soon\". It's not been confirmed what was discussed at the meeting, but White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters: \"There's many options at the president's disposal that are on the table - and I'll let him speak on those.\" US forces have carried out at least 21 strikes on boats it claims were carrying narcotics to its shores over the last few months, and the White House has accused Mr Maduro of being involved in the drugs trade - a claim he denies.  'Psychological terrorism' Mr Maduro - widely considered a dictator by the West - said on Monday that Venezuelans are ready \"to defend [the country] and lead it to the path of peace\". \n                  A shooting on the streets of Washington DC\n                 \n                  Venezuela: Maduro brandishes sword and vows to defy any US attempt to overthrow his government \n                 \n                  Several airlines cancel Venezuela flights after 'hazardous situation' warning\n                 \"We have lived through 22 weeks of aggression that can only be described as psychological terrorism,\" he said. Venezuela has said the boat attacks, which have killed more than 80 people, amount to murder - and that Mr Trump's true motivation is to oust Mr Maduro and access its oil. Concerns have been raised over the legality of the US attacks, which the Pentagon has sought to justify by designating the gangs as foreign terror organisations. Controversy over US strikes Tensions remain high over America's large deployment in the Caribbean Sea and eastern Pacific, which includes its flagship aircraft carrier and thousands of troops. The US has released videos of boats being blown up but has not provided evidence - such as photos of drugs - to support the smuggling claims. Controversy also surrounds the first incident, on 2 September, in which 11 people were killed - with a follow-up strike targeting the boat after the first attack left two survivors in the water. US media reported defence secretary Pete Hegseth gave an order that everyone on board should be killed. However, there are concerns about the legality of the second strike if the survivors posed no threat. Mr Hegseth dismissed the reporting as \"fake news\" and insisted all actions in the region are compliant with US and international law. \"Every trafficker we kill is affiliated with a Designated Terrorist Organization,\" he said on X.  Mr Trump said on Sunday he would not have wanted a second strike and that Mr Hegseth had denied giving such an order. Ms Leavitt confirmed on Monday that the boat had been hit by a second strike - but denied Mr Hegseth gave the order for the follow-up. Instead, she said he had authorised US navy vice admiral Frank Bradley to attack, and the admiral acted \"well within his authority and the law, directing the engagement to ensure the boat was destroyed and the threat to the US was eliminated\".

In recent days, he also stated that Venezuela's airspace should be considered closed - with the South American nation calling it a \"colonial threat\" and \"illegal, and unjustified aggression\"."

During a speech at the Guildhall in London, the prime minister said \"wild promises\" made to the British people ahead of the referendum have been unfulfilled. \"How it was sold and delivered was simply wrong,\" he added. \"We are still dealing with the consequences today.\" Sir Keir argued it would be \"utterly reckless\" to consider Brexit as a template for future foreign policy - and attacked politicians who have a \"corrosive, inward-looking attitude\". He singled out Kemi Badenoch and Nigel Farage, who have both called for the UK to leave the European Convention on Human Rights - and Zack Polanski, who wants to leave NATO. Such attitudes \"offer grievance rather than hope\", the PM said - accusing them of having \"a declinist vision of a lesser Britain, not a Great Britain\". Although Sir Keir opposed Brexit when in Opposition, he stressed that the vote to leave \"was a fair, democratic expression, and I will always respect that\". He told the Lady Mayor's Banquet that Labour has made \"a decisive move to face outward again and build our power, both hard and soft, which had been so damaged and neglected\". 'Protecting our security is non-negotiable' Elsewhere in the speech, the prime minister warned the UK needs a policy towards China that recognises the national security threat it poses. He said: \"For years we have blown hot and cold. We had the 'Golden Age', which then flipped to an 'Ice Age'. We reject that binary choice. \"So our response will not be driven by fear, nor softened by illusion. It will be grounded in strength, clarity and sober realism.\" China has been a major issue in Westminster of late following accusations of spying in parliament, and controversy over the new \"super embassy\" that Beijing wants to build in central London. Chief political correspondent The China hawks like Iain Duncan Smith, Tom Tugendhat and others on the Conservative benches - and indeed Reform - won't like this one little bit. A large part of this speech was devoted to China, and he did talk about the twin-track approach: being tough on national security, but at the same time talking to the Chinese. He bemoaned the fact that a British prime minister hadn't talked to the Chinese premier since Theresa May in February 2018. This was probably the most wide-ranging, perhaps most significant foreign policy speech we've heard from Sir Keir Starmer. It comes against the backdrop of all the political turmoil over the budget, but it was a serious speech. It will please those who want to see the UK taking a much more interventionist approach rather than isolationist. His supporters will like what they've heard here - but not China hawks and Brexiteers. However, Sir Keir defended plans to visit China in the new year - and said an absence of engagement with the world's second-biggest economy would be \"staggering\" and a \"dereliction of duty\". He described it as \"a nation of immense scale, ambition, and ingenuity\" and a \"defining force in technology, trade and global governance\". 'Huge' opportunities for businesses Setting out his own approach, Sir Keir explained: \"This is not a question of balancing economic and security considerations. We don't trade off security in one area, for a bit more economic access somewhere else. \"Protecting our security is non-negotiable - our first duty. But by taking tough steps to keep us secure, we enable ourselves to cooperate in other areas.\" The PM added that he wants to give businesses \"the confidence, clarity, and support\" to win opportunities in China. \"In areas like financial and professional services, creative industries, pharmaceuticals, luxury goods and more - Great British success stories - the export opportunities are huge, and we will back you to seize them,\" he said.  'Starmer continues to kowtow to China' Sky News understands the prime minister is set to approve plans for a controversial Chinese \"super embassy\" in central London. A final decision on the planning application for the former Royal Mint site near the Tower of London is due on 10 December after repeated delays. Concerns were previously raised after Beijing's planning application featured blacked-out areas. Since he was elected last year, Sir Keir has been active on the world stage, trumpeting deals with the US, India, and the EU and leading the \"coalition of the willing\" in support of Ukraine. But he has also faced criticism from his opponents, who accuse him of spending too much time out of the UK attending international summits rather than focusing on domestic issues.

Keir Starmer has become Beijing's useful idiot in Britain.\""

        "Content": "A son of notorious drugs kingpin \"El Chapo\" has pleaded guilty to drug charges in the US. Joaquin Guzman Lopez, 39, known in Mexico as \"Chapitos\" or \"little Chapos\", admitted two counts of drug trafficking and continuing criminal enterprise. As part of a plea deal to avoid a life sentence, he said he had overseen the production and trafficking of large amounts of fentanyl, cocaine, heroin, methamphetamine and cannabis. Most of it is said to have been smuggled through underground tunnels. He was arrested last year when he landed in the US on a private plane with another cartel leader, Ismael \"El Mayo\" Zambada. Zambada's lawyer previously said his client had been \"forcibly kidnapped\" by Guzman Lopez and forced on the US-bound flight. Their capture caused a spike in violence in northern Mexico as two factions of the Sinaloa cartel fought for dominance. \"The government has been very fair with Joaquin thus far,\" defence lawyer Jeffrey Lichtman told reporters after the Chicago court hearing. \"I do appreciate the fact that the Mexican government didn't interfere.\" Joaquin's brother, Ovidio Guzman Lopez, was also a leader in the gang and in July entered a plea deal, admitting drug trafficking, firearms charges and money laundering.

The brothers' father, Joaquin \"El Chapo\" Guzman, received a life sentence in 2019 for leading the Sinaloa cartel and smuggling drugs into America for over 25 years. He famously escaped from his Mexican prison cell in 2015 using a specially built tunnel but was later recaptured and extradited to the US."

        "Content": " Thirteen people have been arrested for suspected manslaughter after Hong Kong's deadliest fire in decades, officials have said.  At a press conference about the tragedy at Wang Fuk Court, police said 151 people had now died as a result of the blaze - Hong Kong's worst since 1948 - and that more than 40 are still missing. An emotional Tsung Shuk Yin, a police official, told reporters on Monday: \"Some of the bodies have turned into ash, therefore, we might not be able to locate all missing individuals.\" The fire last week engulfed multiple high rise blocks of flats. Officials overseeing investigations said that tests on several samples of a green mesh that was wrapped around bamboo scaffolding on the buildings at the time of the blaze did not match fire-retardant standards. Chief secretary Eric Chan told reporters that contractors working on the renovations used substandard materials in hard-to-reach areas, effectively hiding them from inspectors. The officials said that foam insulation used by contractors also fanned the flames, and fire alarms at the complex were not working properly. Sky News had previously learnt that residents raised their fears over fire safety connected to extensive renovations on Wang Fuk Court as early as September 2024. Read more: Hong Kong mourns those lost to fire Labour Department acknowledges reply 'was unclear' In a statement to Sky News, Hong Kong's Labour Department acknowledged that, in reply to these complaints, it told residents the mesh was designed to limit objects falling from the scaffolding and that \"current safety regulations applied to construction sites by the Labour Department do not cover flame-retardant standards for scaffolding netting or any materials\". They now acknowledge this reply to residents \"was unclear and caused misunderstanding\". The Labour Department also told residents they judged the risk of a fire on the scaffolding was \"relatively low\", because the works did not include activities such as welding. In its statement to Sky News, the Labour Department says this did not mean the risk was negligible, and also noted contractors had been reminded to \"implement fire prevention measures.\"  The blaze broke out at the Wang Fuk Court housing complex in the city's Tai Po district on Wednesday. Records show the site consists of eight blocks, with almost 2,000 apartments housing around 4,800 residents, including many elderly people. It was built in the 1980s and has recently been undergoing a major renovation. On Sunday, more than 1,000 people turned out to pay tribute to the victims of the fire, queuing for more than a kilometre to lay flowers, some with sticky notes attached addressed to the victims. Man calling for probe detained Meanwhile, it emerged that police detained Miles Kwan, 24, who was part of a group that launched a petition demanding an independent probe into possible corruption and a review of construction oversight. An online petition demanding an independent probe into possible corruption and a review of construction oversight drew over 10,000 signatures before it was closed. Another petition with similar demands attracted more than 2,700 signatures with its plea for \"explicit accountability\" from the government.

The news outlet could not establish whether he had been arrested. He was pictured leaving a police station in a taxi on Monday afternoon. Police did not comment on the case, and Hong Kong Security Chief Chris Tang also declined to comment on specific operations at a press conference on Monday. He added: \"I've noticed that some people with malicious intent, aiming to harm Hong Kong and national security, have taken advantage of this painful moment for society. \"Therefore, we must take appropriate action, including enforcement measures.\" In a statement about the arrest, Luk Chi-man, executive director of Amnesty International Hong Kong Overseas, said: \"We urge the Hong Kong authorities to establish the full facts of last week's tragedy through a thorough, independent, impartial and open investigation, and to publicly clarify the cause of the fire, hold relevant persons accountable and release all findings without delay. \"It is both a right and a duty for people in Hong Kong to demand this kind of accountability; but rather than recognise this, the Hong Kong authorities have instead chosen to silence those who raise their concerns and demands. \"A healthy society should not have only one voice.\""

        "Content": " The family of a father-of-four who died on holiday in Benidorm say new evidence has further convinced them that foul play was involved in his death. Nathan Osman, 30, from Pontypridd in South Wales, was on a long weekend break with friends in Benidorm in September 2024. Less than 24 hours after he arrived, his body was found by an off-duty police officer at the bottom of a remote 650ft (200m) cliff on the outskirts of the resort. He died from head and abdominal injuries after falling from height, a post-mortem found. Local police said it was \"a tragic accident\" that occurred after Nathan left his friends in Benidorm to walk back to his hotel room alone. But his family believe the investigation into his death has not been adequate, and that the local authorities have never considered the possibility of a homicide. Their suspicions of foul play were first provoked by the fact that the remote location where Nathan was found was in the opposite direction to the hotel, and some distance away on foot. They began doing their own investigating, building a timeline of events drawn from sources including CCTV, witness statements and Nathan's bank records, which they say showed attempts were made to use his bank cards the day after he died. After presenting their findings to Spanish prosecutors as evidence that others may have been involved, the case was reopened earlier this year. Now, the family have told Sarah-Jane Mee on The UK Tonight that new phone data they have uncovered suggests he couldn't have reached the spot he was found on foot. After getting the phone back a couple of months ago, they say they tracked Nathan's last movements through a health app. \"There's a breakdown inside the app of every 10 minutes - the distance, pace, measurement of pace… every detail you can think of,\" Nathan's brother, Lee Evans, tells Mee. \"His pace wasn't consistent with a fast walk or even a sprint.\" He said it was a faster journey, despite being uphill for 40 minutes, which has convinced the family that he was in a vehicle. The family also went to visit the area where Nathan was found. \"We were a bit upset, but we were very pleased we went up there\", his mother, Elizabeth, says. \"We could see… there's no way he would have looked at that area and thought, 'I'm going up here.' \"You can see straight off, there's no clubs, there's no hotels up there, there's just the odd house dotted around. It was just out in the wild, there was nothing up there.\" Read more from Sky News:Teen dies after 'exiting' ambulance on motorwayKing officially strips Andrew of two more titles The family says the phone data has helped them determine that he died around half an hour after he was seen on CCTV walking towards his hotel in the early hours of the morning. \"It was really ridiculous to think that my son would've walked up there [the remote location where he died] at 4am in the pitch dark.\" After the family were interviewed by Mee in May, South Wales Police opened its own investigation into Nathan's death.  Lee says the Welsh force has been \"appalled\" by the lack of evidence turned over from the local police's investigation. His and Nathan's father, Jonathan, says: \"No procedures were followed. Nothing was cordoned off, it wasn't a crime scene. There's loads of things that could've been taken. Tyre tracks, foot tracks, nothing. No DNA taken.\" Lee says: \"All that we've done over the last year, this could've been squashed within the first week, two weeks [by local investigators]. \"We've had to find out and keep delving into every possible outcome and overturn every stone possible. We started off with… a needle in a haystack, we had no direction or any support on which way to go.\" What does Nathan's family hope for now? Nathan's family say they have located 27 CCTV cameras which could have picked Nathan up in the area, after local investigators didn't find any. Elizabeth says that after alerting Spanish police to the locations, they were told that the CCTV \"wouldn't be working\" or that footage would've already been erased. \"They just surmised everything,\" she adds. But the family, who found the last known CCTV footage of Nathan earlier this year, are convinced there is still hope. Lee says: \"There's a number of CCTV footage in that area. We know there's a way of finding a vehicle of some sort.\" But the family admit they may never find whoever could be responsible for Nathan's death because so much time has been lost. Elizabeth concludes: \"Nathan walks with us every day. We all believe that,\" adding that \"all we want\" is to find the ones responsible for his death and for him to \"have the respect of a decent investigation\". Sky News contacted Spanish police, which declined to comment, adding the case is under judicial review and it doesn't want to hinder the course of the investigation. South Wales Police told Sky News: \"South Wales Police is carrying out enquiries on behalf of HM Coroner and a family liaison officer has been appointed to provide support.\""

        "Content": "Luigi Mangione has watched surveillance videos of the killing of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson at a court appearance. Mangione has pleaded not guilty to state and federal murder charges over the killing of Mr Thompson. The state charges carry the possibility of life in prison, while federal prosecutors are seeking the death penalty. The 27-year-old's lawyers are seeking to bar evidence, including a 9mm handgun and a notebook in which prosecutors say he described his intent to \"wack\" a health insurance executive, from his New York state trial. Both were allegedly found in a backpack Mangione had with him when he was arrested. Mr Thompson, 50, was shot dead on 4 December last year as he walked to a New York City hotel for his company's annual investor conference, sparking a five-day manhunt. Mangione was arrested after a McDonald's employee in Pennsylvania alerted authorities to a customer who looked like the suspect in the killing. Mangione, wearing a white shirt with a red checked pattern under a grey suit, watched without emotion as prosecutors played surveillance videos showing Mr Thompson's killing on a Manhattan pavement, as well as his own arrest, at a court appearance in New York on Monday. The videos, including footage from the McDonald's restaurant in Pennsylvania where he was arrested, kicked off a hearing on Mangione's fight to bar evidence from his trial, including the gun prosecutors say matches the one used in the early-hours attack. Read more from Sky News:US and UK agree zero tariffs on pharmaceuticalsMore than 1,100 confirmed dead in catastrophic Asia floods After getting state terrorism charges thrown out in September, Mangione's lawyers are focusing on what they argue was unconstitutional police conduct threatening his right to a fair trial. They are seeking to block prosecutors from using evidence allegedly discovered in his backpack during his arrest, and statements he made to police, arguing that he was illegally searched and questioned. Eliminating the gun and notebook would be huge wins for Mangione's defence, and a major setback for prosecutors, depriving them of a possible murder weapon and evidence they say points to motive. Mangione also faces seven counts of criminal possession of a weapon, and one count of possessing a false identification. Judge Gregory Carro dismissed two terrorism counts against Mangione in September. He found that prosecutors had not presented enough evidence that Mangione intended to intimidate health insurance workers or influence government policy. Trial dates have not been set in either the state or federal cases. Mangione has been held in federal custody in Brooklyn since his arrest."

        "Content": " Nicolas Maduro has said Venezuelans are ready to defend their country as the US considers a land attack. The president held a rally in Caracas amid heightened tensions with Donald Trump's administration, which has been targeting what it says are boats carrying drug smugglers. Mr Trump met his national security team on Monday evening, having warned last week that land strikes would start \"very soon\". It's not been confirmed what was discussed at the meeting, but White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters: \"There's many options at the president's disposal that are on the table - and I'll let him speak on those.\" US forces have carried out at least 21 strikes on boats it claims were carrying narcotics to its shores over the last few months, and the White House has accused Mr Maduro of being involved in the drugs trade - a claim he denies.  'Psychological terrorism' Mr Maduro - widely considered a dictator by the West - said on Monday that Venezuelans are ready \"to defend [the country] and lead it to the path of peace\". \n                  A shooting on the streets of Washington DC\n                 \n                  Venezuela: Maduro brandishes sword and vows to defy any US attempt to overthrow his government \n                 \n                  Several airlines cancel Venezuela flights after 'hazardous situation' warning\n                 \"We have lived through 22 weeks of aggression that can only be described as psychological terrorism,\" he said. Venezuela has said the boat attacks, which have killed more than 80 people, amount to murder - and that Mr Trump's true motivation is to oust Mr Maduro and access its oil. Concerns have been raised over the legality of the US attacks, which the Pentagon has sought to justify by designating the gangs as foreign terror organisations. Controversy over US strikes Tensions remain high over America's large deployment in the Caribbean Sea and eastern Pacific, which includes its flagship aircraft carrier and thousands of troops. The US has released videos of boats being blown up but has not provided evidence - such as photos of drugs - to support the smuggling claims. Controversy also surrounds the first incident, on 2 September, in which 11 people were killed - with a follow-up strike targeting the boat after the first attack left two survivors in the water. US media reported defence secretary Pete Hegseth gave an order that everyone on board should be killed. However, there are concerns about the legality of the second strike if the survivors posed no threat. Mr Hegseth dismissed the reporting as \"fake news\" and insisted all actions in the region are compliant with US and international law. \"Every trafficker we kill is affiliated with a Designated Terrorist Organization,\" he said on X.  Mr Trump said on Sunday he would not have wanted a second strike and that Mr Hegseth had denied giving such an order. Ms Leavitt confirmed on Monday that the boat had been hit by a second strike - but denied Mr Hegseth gave the order for the follow-up. Instead, she said he had authorised US navy vice admiral Frank Bradley to attack, and the admiral acted \"well within his authority and the law, directing the engagement to ensure the boat was destroyed and the threat to the US was eliminated\".

In recent days, he also stated that Venezuela's airspace should be considered closed - with the South American nation calling it a \"colonial threat\" and \"illegal, and unjustified aggression\"."

He added that there was \"no evidence of arterial narrowing impairing blood flow or abnormalities in the heart or major vessels\". \"The heart chambers are normal in size, the vessel walls appear smooth and health, and there are no signs of inflammation, or clotting.\" As for the abdominal imaging, he wrote that \"all major organs appear very healthy and well-perfused\". \n                  Venezuela accuses Trump of 'colonial threat,' after US president 'closes' its airspace \n                 \n                  Trump says he will cancel all Biden executive orders 'signed with autopen'\n                 \n                  Suspect in US National Guard shooting now facing first-degree murder charge\n                 \"Everything evaluated is functioning within normal limits with no acute or chronic concerns.\" He said the imaging was done \"because men in his age group benefit from a thorough evaluation of cardiovascular and abdominal health\". While speaking to reporters on Sunday, the US president said he didn't know what part of his body was examined but added: \"It wasn't the brain because I took a cognitive test and I aced it.\" He described the results of the MRI as \"perfect\".

Dr Barbabella said CVI, which causes blood to pool in the veins, was a \"benign and common condition, particularly in individuals over the age of 70\". Concerns were also raised in July about photos which showed bruising on the back of Mr Trump's hand that had been covered with make-up. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt clarified this was \"minor soft tissue irritation from frequent handshaking and the use of aspirin\" to reduce the risk of heart attack and stroke."

        "Content": "A son of notorious drugs kingpin \"El Chapo\" has pleaded guilty to drug charges in the US. Joaquin Guzman Lopez, 39, known in Mexico as \"Chapitos\" or \"little Chapos\", admitted two counts of drug trafficking and continuing criminal enterprise. As part of a plea deal to avoid a life sentence, he said he had overseen the production and trafficking of large amounts of fentanyl, cocaine, heroin, methamphetamine and cannabis. Most of it is said to have been smuggled through underground tunnels. He was arrested last year when he landed in the US on a private plane with another cartel leader, Ismael \"El Mayo\" Zambada. Zambada's lawyer previously said his client had been \"forcibly kidnapped\" by Guzman Lopez and forced on the US-bound flight. Their capture caused a spike in violence in northern Mexico as two factions of the Sinaloa cartel fought for dominance. \"The government has been very fair with Joaquin thus far,\" defence lawyer Jeffrey Lichtman told reporters after the Chicago court hearing. \"I do appreciate the fact that the Mexican government didn't interfere.\" Joaquin's brother, Ovidio Guzman Lopez, was also a leader in the gang and in July entered a plea deal, admitting drug trafficking, firearms charges and money laundering.

The brothers' father, Joaquin \"El Chapo\" Guzman, received a life sentence in 2019 for leading the Sinaloa cartel and smuggling drugs into America for over 25 years. He famously escaped from his Mexican prison cell in 2015 using a specially built tunnel but was later recaptured and extradited to the US."

Mangione has pleaded not guilty to state and federal murder charges over the killing of Mr Thompson. The state charges carry the possibility of life in prison, while federal prosecutors are seeking the death penalty. The 27-year-old's lawyers are seeking to bar evidence, including a 9mm handgun and a notebook in which prosecutors say he described his intent to \"wack\" a health insurance executive, from his New York state trial. Both were allegedly found in a backpack Mangione had with him when he was arrested. Mr Thompson, 50, was shot dead on 4 December last year as he walked to a New York City hotel for his company's annual investor conference, sparking a five-day manhunt. Mangione was arrested after a McDonald's employee in Pennsylvania alerted authorities to a customer who looked like the suspect in the killing. Mangione, wearing a white shirt with a red checked pattern under a grey suit, watched without emotion as prosecutors played surveillance videos showing Mr Thompson's killing on a Manhattan pavement, as well as his own arrest, at a court appearance in New York on Monday. The videos, including footage from the McDonald's restaurant in Pennsylvania where he was arrested, kicked off a hearing on Mangione's fight to bar evidence from his trial, including the gun prosecutors say matches the one used in the early-hours attack. Read more from Sky News:US and UK agree zero tariffs on pharmaceuticalsMore than 1,100 confirmed dead in catastrophic Asia floods After getting state terrorism charges thrown out in September, Mangione's lawyers are focusing on what they argue was unconstitutional police conduct threatening his right to a fair trial. They are seeking to block prosecutors from using evidence allegedly discovered in his backpack during his arrest, and statements he made to police, arguing that he was illegally searched and questioned. Eliminating the gun and notebook would be huge wins for Mangione's defence, and a major setback for prosecutors, depriving them of a possible murder weapon and evidence they say points to motive. Mangione also faces seven counts of criminal possession of a weapon, and one count of possessing a false identification. Judge Gregory Carro dismissed two terrorism counts against Mangione in September. He found that prosecutors had not presented enough evidence that Mangione intended to intimidate health insurance workers or influence government policy. Trial dates have not been set in either the state or federal cases. Mangione has been held in federal custody in Brooklyn since his arrest."

        "Content": " Airbus fleets have returned to normal operations after a software issue that could have affected flight controls was fixed faster than expected.  The manufacturer issued an alert about the problem affecting the A320 family of aircraft on Friday after analysis of a flight involving an A320 showed \"intense solar radiation may corrupt data critical to the functioning of flight controls\". Dozens of airlines said they had carried out the snap software retrofit over the weekend, with Airbus confirming on Monday the \"vast majority\" of around 6,000 of its A320 fleet affected by the software issue had been modified.   \"We are working with our airline customers to support the modification of less than 100 remaining aircraft to ensure they can be returned to service,\" Airbus said. \"Airbus apologises for any challenges and delays caused to passengers and airlines by this event.\" Meanwhile, the manufacturer discovered an industrial quality issue affecting fuselage panels of several dozen A320-family aircraft, leading to a delay of some deliveries, industry sources said on Monday. There are said to be no indications the suspected production flaw has reached aircraft in service. The incident that triggered the software warning involved a JetBlue A320 plane flying from Cancun, Mexico, to Newark in the US on 30 October. That flight was diverted to Tampa International Airport after it suffered a flight control issue and experienced a sharp loss of altitude, which injured at least 15 passengers. \"Intense solar radiation\" is suspected of contributing to the flight's sudden drop in altitude. America's aviation watchdog issued an emergency order to immediately replace or modify the software, mirroring one from the European Union Aviation Safety Agency. Airbus is understood to have traced the issue to the ELAC (Elevator and Aileron Computer) system, which sends commands to elevators on the plane's tail. These in turn control the aircraft's pitch or nose angle. The fix involves A320 aircraft reverting to an earlier software version and Airbus stressed it would only take two to three hours for most planes. However, some jets will also need new hardware and therefore will be affected for longer, it said. Travellers experienced disruption over the weekend, as airlines cancelled flights to fix the issue. Disruption continues on Monday as JetBlue said it would cancel 20 flights as it worked to return 137 of 150 A320s to service, while Colombia's Avianca Airlines said it would continue to halt bookings for dates until 8 December. But several airlines revised down estimates of the number of planes impacted and of the time needed for the software tweak, fixing their aircraft sooner than anticipated. Airlines easyJet and Wizz Air said on Monday they had completed the updates over the weekend without cancelling any flights.

Airbus, which is registered in the Netherlands but has its main headquarters in France, is one of the world's biggest aeroplane manufacturers, alongside Boeing.

        "Content": "\n          Economics and data editor\n              @EdConwaySky\n  Did the chancellor mislead the public, and her own cabinet, before the budget? It's a good question, and we'll come to it in a second, but let's begin with an even bigger one: is the prime minister continuing to mislead the public over the budget? The details are a bit complex but ultimately this all comes back to a rather simple question: why did the government raise taxes in last week's budget? To judge from the prime minister's responses at a news conference just this morning, you might have judged that the answer is: \"because we had to\". \"There was an OBR productivity review,\" he explained to one journalist. \"The result of that was there was £16bn less than we might otherwise have had. That's a difficult starting point for any budget.\" Politics latest: OBR boss resigns over budget leak  Time and time again throughout the news conference, he repeated the same point: the Office for Budget Responsibility had revised its forecasts for the UK economy and the upshot of that was that the government had a £16bn hole in its accounts. Keep that figure in your head for a bit, because it's not without significance. But for the time being, let's take a step back and recall that budgets are mostly about the difference between two numbers: revenues and expenditure; tax and spending. This government has set itself a fiscal rule - that it needs, within a few years, to ensure that, after netting out investment, the tax bar needs to be higher than the spending bar. At the time of the last budget, taxes were indeed higher than current spending, once the economic cycle is taken account of or, to put it in economists' language, there was a surplus in the cyclically adjusted current budget. The chancellor had met her fiscal rule, by £9.9bn. This, it's worth saying, is not a very large margin by which to meet your fiscal rule. A typical budget can see revisions and changes that would swamp that in one fell swoop. And part of the explanation for why there has been so much speculation about tax rises over the summer is that the chancellor left herself so little \"headroom\" against the rule. And since everyone could see debt interest costs were going up, it seemed quite plausible that the government would have to raise taxes. Then, over the summer, the OBR, whose job it is to make the official government forecasts, and to mark its fiscal homework, told the government it was also doing something else: reviewing the state of Britain's productivity. This set alarm bells ringing in Downing Street - and understandably. The weaker productivity growth is, the less income we're all earning, and the less income we're earning, the less tax revenues there are going into the exchequer. The early signs were that the productivity review would knock tens of billions of pounds off the chancellor's \"headroom\" - that it could, in one fell swoop, wipe off that £9.9bn and send it into the red. Read more:Main budget announcements - at a glanceEnter your salary to see how the budget affects you That is why stories began to brew through the summer that the chancellor was considering raising taxes. The Treasury was preparing itself for some grisly news. But here's the interesting thing: when the bad news (that productivity review) did eventually arrive, it was far less grisly than expected. True: the one-off productivity \"hit\" to the public finances was £16bn. But - and this is crucial - that was offset by a lot of other, much better news (at least from the exchequer's perspective). Higher wage inflation meant higher expected tax revenues, not to mention a host of other impacts. All told, when everything was totted up, the hit to the public finances wasn't £16bn but somewhere between £5bn and £6bn.  Why is that number significant? Because it's short of the chancellor's existing £9.9bn headroom. Or, to put it another way, the OBR's forecasting exercise was not enough to force her to raise taxes. The decision to raise taxes, in other words, came down to something else. It came down to the fact that the government U-turned on a number of its welfare reforms over the summer. It came down to the fact that they wanted to axe the two-child benefits cap. And, on top of this, it came down to the fact that they wanted to raise their \"headroom\" against the fiscal rules from £9.9bn to over £20bn. These are all perfectly logical reasons to raise tax - though some will disagree on their wisdom. But here's the key thing: they are the chancellor and prime minister's decisions. They are not knee-jerk responses to someone else's bad news. Yet when the prime minister explained his budget decisions, he focused mostly on that OBR report. In fact, worse, he selectively quoted the £16bn number from the productivity review without acknowledging that it was only one part of the story. That seems pretty misleading to me."

The criminal investigation into the scandal, in which hundreds of postmasters were wrongfully convicted of theft and false accounting via the Horizon software, has also been expanded to include more \"persons of interest\" and an additional suspect. A further person has also been interviewed under caution, the National Police Chief's Council (NPCC) said on Monday. Money blog: major phone networks face £1bn suit None of the people in question have been named, but the NPCC previously said persons of interest include Post Office investigators, lawyers, and management across Fujitsu, who made the Horizon computer programme, and the Post Office. Material has been passed to the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS), who conduct criminal prosecutions, about some of the suspects. This process will continue until the CPS \"have sufficient material to allow them to make a final charging decision\", the NPCC said.

After another person was interviewed under caution, it means five people have now been interviewed in this formal way, while the announced additional suspect brings the total number of suspects to eight. No arrests have been made as police said it was \"not necessary given the way we interview and use additional warrants where necessary to secure additional material\".

Regulator, Ofcom, ruled the telecoms company had placed thousands of people \"at direct risk of harm\". The watchdog said users of Telecare - an emergency alarm and monitoring service - were disconnected if they failed to engage with a process, in late 2023, which switched old analogue lines to a digital alternative. Money latest: Life as an international boxer Ofcom said that Virgin Media had disclosed its own failures under consumer protection rules and its full cooperation was taken into account when determining the size of the penalty. Ian Strawhorne, Ofcom’s director of enforcement, said: “It’s unacceptable that vulnerable customers were put at direct risk of harm and left without appropriate support by Virgin Media, during what should have been a safe and straightforward upgrade to their landline services. \"Today’s fine makes clear to companies that, if they fail to protect their vulnerable customers, they can expect to face similar enforcement action.\" \n                  Is Starmer continuing to mislead public over the budget?\n                 \n                  US and UK agree zero tariffs on pharmaceuticals\n                 \n                  Post Office scandal: Police consider corporate manslaughter charges\n                 Ofcom found that Virgin Media failed properly to identify and record the status of telecare customers, resulting in significant gaps in the screening process. \"This meant that those affected did not receive the appropriate level of tailored support through the migration process\", it said. It also criticised Virgin Media's approach to disconnecting Telecare customers who did not engage in the migration process, \"despite being aware of the risks posed\". The watchdog said it had put thousands of vulnerable customers \"at a direct risk of harm and prevented their devices from connecting to alarm monitoring centres while the disconnection was in place\".  The money from the fine goes to the Treasury. A Virgin Media spokesperson said: \"As traditional analogue landlines become less reliable and difficult to maintain, it's essential we move our customers to digital services. \"While historically the majority of migrations were completed without issue, we recognise that we didn't get everything right and have since addressed the migration issues identified by Ofcom. \"Our customers' safety is always our top priority and, following an end-to-end review which began in 2023, we have already introduced a comprehensive package of improvements and enhanced support for vulnerable customers including improved communications, additional in-home support and extensive post-migration checks, as well as working with the industry and Government on a joint national awareness campaign. \"We've been working closely with Ofcom, telecare providers and local authorities to identify customers requiring additional support and are confident that the processes, policies and procedures we now have in place allow us to safely move customers to digital landlines.\""

        "Content": " Sir Keir Starmer has denied he and the chancellor misled the public and the cabinet over the state of the UK's public finances ahead of the budget. The prime minister told Sky News' political editor Beth Rigby \"there was no misleading\", following claims he and Rachel Reeves deliberately said public finances were in a dire state, when they were not. Politics latest: Reeves says Cabinet briefed on morning of budget He said a productivity review by the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), which provides fiscal forecasts to the government, meant there would be £16bn less available so the government had to take that into account. \"To suggest that a government that is saying that's not a good starting point is misleading is wrong, in my view,\" Sir Keir said. Cabinet ministers have said they felt misled by the chancellor and prime minister, who warned public finances were in a worse state than they thought, so they would have to raise taxes, including income tax, which they had promised not to in their party manifesto. At last Wednesday's budget, Ms Reeves unveiled a record-breaking £26bn in tax rises, although an income tax increase was not included. The OBR published the forecasts it provided to the chancellor in the two months before the budget, which showed there was a £4.2bn headroom on 31 October - ahead of that warning about possible income tax rises on 4 November. Sir Keir added: \"There was a point at which we did think we would have to breach the manifesto in order to achieve what we wanted to achieve. \"Later on, it became possible to do it without the manifesto breach. And that's why we came to the decisions that we did.\" 👉Listen to Politics at Sam and Anne's on your podcast app👈 Sir Keir said a productivity review had not taken place in 15 years and questioned why it was not done at the end of the last government. He blamed the Conservatives for the OBR downgrading medium-term productivity growth by 0.3 percentage points to 1% at the end of the five-year forecast. Read more:Senior cabinet minister defends Reeves'Of course I didn't lie about budget forecasts, says chancellor  The prime minister added: \"I wanted to more than double the headroom, and to bear down on the cost of living, because I know that for families and communities across the country, that is the single most important issue, I wanted to achieve all those things. \"Starting that exercise with £16bn less than we might otherwise have had. Of course, there are other figures in this, but there's no pretending that that's a good starting point for a government.\" Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch said the PM \"will blame everybody else for the mess that he is making\" and accused him of being \"a man who cannot say sorry, who cannot admit that he's got things wrong\". She said many of the issues that caused the OBR's productivity downgrade happened before she was an MP, in 2017, and were \"mostly to do with COVID\". \"That productivity downgrade that they're talking about is a distraction,\" she added. \"It is not the reason that she had to get £26 billion. In fact, the OBR said that there was a surplus at the same point.\" Ms Reeves told BBC Wales on Monday the cabinet are briefed \"on the morning of the budget on the budget numbers\" and said the \"whole information of the budget is not supposed to be provided until the chancellor delivers the budget\". On Sunday, when asked by Sky's Trevor Phillips if she lied, Ms Reeves said: \"Of course I didn't.\" She also said the OBR's downgrade of productivity meant the forecast for tax receipts was £16bn lower than expected, so she needed to increase taxes to create fiscal headroom."

Sky News has learnt that Blackstone is seriously contemplating abandoning its interest in a deal ahead of a December 8 deadline - imposed by the Takeover Panel - to announce a firm offer or walk away. City sources said on Monday that Blackstone, which is said to have been working on its interest with the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board (CPPIB), had yet to make a final decision about a Big Yellow offer. However, the self-storage company's key executives are said to be keen to extract an offer worth at least £14-a-share. Big Yellow shares were trading at roughly £11.54, giving the company a market capitalisation of approximately £2.3bn. Analysts and investors had concluded that last week's budget statement from the chancellor, Rachel Reeves, had paved the way for Blackstone to firm up its interest and lodge a formal bid - an outcome which could still materialise, subject to further discussions. However, a withdrawal is now said to be the likeliest outcome, according to insiders. \n                  Is Starmer continuing to mislead public over the budget?\n                 \n                  US and UK agree zero tariffs on pharmaceuticals\n                 \n                  Post Office scandal: Police consider corporate manslaughter charges\n                 Blackstone's deliberations about a takeover come weeks after it committed to investing £100bn in the UK economy in the coming years, reflecting its position as one of the most prolific buyers of British-based companies and assets. Among its existing UK portfolio is the NEC conference and exhibition centre, the Legoland parent company Merlin Entertainments, and IQSA, a provider of student accommodation. On Monday afternoon, Blackstone declined to comment, while Big Yellow has been contacted for comment."

Sky News has learnt that NatWest is acquiring a minority shareholding in Bourn, which was founded last year to help SMEs address common cashflow challenges. While tiny in financial terms, NatWest's investment in the start-up will underline the attempt being made under the bank's chief executive, Paul Thwaite, to accelerate product and service innovation across its core customer bases. Last week, Sky News revealed that NatWest is in talks to sell its majority-owned workplace pensions platform, Cushon, to an arm of the pensions giant Willis Towers Watson. Money latest: The earners most affected by £2k salary sacrifice cap Its stake in Bourn forms part of a £3.5m funding round to be announced on Tuesday by the start-up. Its new funding, to which investors including Portfolio Ventures, McPike Global Family Office, Haatch, Love Ventures and Aperture have also contributed, will be used to accelerate the rollout of its flagship product, the Flexible Trade Account (FTA). \n                  Is Starmer continuing to mislead public over the budget?\n                 \n                  US and UK agree zero tariffs on pharmaceuticals\n                 \n                  Post Office scandal: Police consider corporate manslaughter charges\n                 Bourn claims that the FTA is effectively a reinvention of the business overdraft by embedding overdraft-style flexibility directly into the bank accounts and financial platforms SMEs already operate. It says that this removes friction and unlocks a faster flow of capital to those smaller businesses. \"2025 has been a year of validation, proving that SMEs and their funding partners need a more modern, data-driven approach to working capital,\" Nick Tracey, Bourn's co-founder and chief executive, said. \"This investment round…shows that established banks see the same opportunity we do: to bring liquidity closer to the point of need and help businesses fund growth more dynamically. \"Our goal is to reinvent the business overdraft for SMEs. \"When working capital flows easily, businesses invest, hire and grow. \"That's how we make finance work for the real economy again.\" NatWest's stake in Bourn has been orchestrated with a view to the two companies collaborating to assist the bank's mid-market and broader business customer bases. The high street lender intends to use insights gleaned from the FTA to explore how embedded working capital can strengthen cashflow access for entrepreneurs and businesses. \"Now more than ever, SMEs need the right support to scale and grow - which is why Bourn's offering has so much potential,\" said Ladi Greenstreet, head of strategic investments at NatWest. \"Their founding team combines deep banking expertise with genuine fintech innovation, while their capabilities complement our ambition to help customers access working capital seamlessly through the platforms they already use. \"Supporting Bourn reinforces our commitment to helping fintechs thrive while ensuring our commercial mid-market customers can access the funding and support they need.\""

        "Content": " Sir Keir Starmer has warned China poses \"real national security threats to the United Kingdom\" - and hit out at Brexit. During a speech at the Guildhall in London, the prime minister said \"wild promises\" made to the British people ahead of the referendum have been unfulfilled. \"How it was sold and delivered was simply wrong,\" he added. \"We are still dealing with the consequences today.\" Sir Keir argued it would be \"utterly reckless\" to consider Brexit as a template for future foreign policy - and attacked politicians who have a \"corrosive, inward-looking attitude\". He singled out Kemi Badenoch and Nigel Farage, who have both called for the UK to leave the European Convention on Human Rights - and Zack Polanski, who wants to leave NATO. Such attitudes \"offer grievance rather than hope\", the PM said - accusing them of having \"a declinist vision of a lesser Britain, not a Great Britain\". Although Sir Keir opposed Brexit when in Opposition, he stressed that the vote to leave \"was a fair, democratic expression, and I will always respect that\". He told the Lady Mayor's Banquet that Labour has made \"a decisive move to face outward again and build our power, both hard and soft, which had been so damaged and neglected\". 'Protecting our security is non-negotiable' Elsewhere in the speech, the prime minister warned the UK needs a policy towards China that recognises the national security threat it poses. He said: \"For years we have blown hot and cold. We had the 'Golden Age', which then flipped to an 'Ice Age'. We reject that binary choice. \"So our response will not be driven by fear, nor softened by illusion. It will be grounded in strength, clarity and sober realism.\" China has been a major issue in Westminster of late following accusations of spying in parliament, and controversy over the new \"super embassy\" that Beijing wants to build in central London. Chief political correspondent The China hawks like Iain Duncan Smith, Tom Tugendhat and others on the Conservative benches - and indeed Reform - won't like this one little bit. A large part of this speech was devoted to China, and he did talk about the twin-track approach: being tough on national security, but at the same time talking to the Chinese. He bemoaned the fact that a British prime minister hadn't talked to the Chinese premier since Theresa May in February 2018. This was probably the most wide-ranging, perhaps most significant foreign policy speech we've heard from Sir Keir Starmer. It comes against the backdrop of all the political turmoil over the budget, but it was a serious speech. It will please those who want to see the UK taking a much more interventionist approach rather than isolationist. His supporters will like what they've heard here - but not China hawks and Brexiteers. However, Sir Keir defended plans to visit China in the new year - and said an absence of engagement with the world's second-biggest economy would be \"staggering\" and a \"dereliction of duty\". He described it as \"a nation of immense scale, ambition, and ingenuity\" and a \"defining force in technology, trade and global governance\". 'Huge' opportunities for businesses Setting out his own approach, Sir Keir explained: \"This is not a question of balancing economic and security considerations. We don't trade off security in one area, for a bit more economic access somewhere else. \"Protecting our security is non-negotiable - our first duty. But by taking tough steps to keep us secure, we enable ourselves to cooperate in other areas.\" The PM added that he wants to give businesses \"the confidence, clarity, and support\" to win opportunities in China. \"In areas like financial and professional services, creative industries, pharmaceuticals, luxury goods and more - Great British success stories - the export opportunities are huge, and we will back you to seize them,\" he said.  'Starmer continues to kowtow to China' Sky News understands the prime minister is set to approve plans for a controversial Chinese \"super embassy\" in central London. A final decision on the planning application for the former Royal Mint site near the Tower of London is due on 10 December after repeated delays. Concerns were previously raised after Beijing's planning application featured blacked-out areas. Since he was elected last year, Sir Keir has been active on the world stage, trumpeting deals with the US, India, and the EU and leading the \"coalition of the willing\" in support of Ukraine. But he has also faced criticism from his opponents, who accuse him of spending too much time out of the UK attending international summits rather than focusing on domestic issues. Read more:MI5 spying warning aims to send signal to China'Many options' on table for Venezuela Responding to the prime minister's speech, shadow foreign secretary Dame Priti Patel said: \"From China's continued flouting of economic rules to transnational repression of Hong Kongers in Britain, Starmer's 'reset' with Beijing is a naive one-way street, which puts Britain at risk while Beijing gets everything it wants. \"Starmer continues to kowtow to China and is captivated by half-baked promises of trade. \"Coming just days after the latest Chinese plot to interfere in our democracy was exposed, his love letter to the Chinese Communist Party is a desperate ploy to generate economic growth following his budget of lies and is completely ill-judged. \"While China poses a clear threat to Britain, China continues to back Iran and Russia, and plots to undermine our institutions.

The probe found there was \"nothing to suggest\" the premature access was the result of \"hostile cyber activity by foreign actors or cyber criminals, or of connivance by anyone working for the OBR\". \"Nor was it simply a matter of pressing the publication button on a locally managed website too early,\" the report stated. It concluded that \"configuration errors\" led to \"a failure to ensure the protections which hide documents from public view immediately before publication were in place\". \"The ultimate responsibility for the circumstances in which this vulnerability occurred and was then exposed rests, over the years, with the leadership of the OBR,\" the investigation said.  Kemi Badenoch claimed that Ms Reeves was trying to use Mr Hughes as a \"human shield\". The Conservative leader said on social media: \"More serious questions for the chancellor as she tries to make Richard Hughes her human shield. \"Her actions have turned this into a full blown political crisis for the government. If [Prime Minister] Keir Starmer had a backbone, he would have sacked Reeves long ago.\" Mr Hughes had been under pressure to explain the leak, which he immediately apologised for, and ordered the investigation. It is also led by Professor David Miles and Tom Josephs, with Baroness Sarah Hogg and Dame Susan Rice as non-executive members. There are 52 permanent staff, who are civil servants, with six of those working on the strategy, operations and communications team. The report acknowledged the leak \"changed the pattern of budget day to the chancellor's disadvantage\".

And it said last week's budget forecast document had multiple attempts to access it before it was inadvertently made accessible online. The investigation partly blamed the Treasury and the Cabinet Office, as the OBR's IT services were moved on to the Treasury's shared systems in 2023 to \"align more closely with Treasury security arrangements\", particularly around the sharing of sensitive budget information between the OBR and Treasury. It said the Treasury should pay \"greater attention\" when setting the OBR's budget, currently £6.4m, to the need for adequate support. The investigation said there was pressure on the small team involved to ensure the full economic and fiscal outlook was published when the chancellor sat down after giving her budget, so a pre-publication \"facility\" was used. But this commonly used device created a \"potential vulnerability if not configured properly\" and had not received the same amount of attention by the OBR as it had placed on security of communications with the Treasury \"during the long period of run-up to the budget\".  An outside web developer, who has helped the OBR team since it came into existence 15 years ago, assists the internal team and manages content and uploads at times of pressure, including the release of the budget forecast. The report said the risks of this approach have increased over the years as technologies have developed and online threats have risen. \"With hindsight, it is clear that over the years this arrangement should have been regularly reexamined and assessed by the management of the OBR,\" the report said. It recommended the process for publishing forecasts should \"immediately\" be removed from the OBR's locally managed website, which is a WordPress website, and published as part of a government website."

        "Content": "\n          Economics and data editor\n              @EdConwaySky\n  Did the chancellor mislead the public, and her own cabinet, before the budget? It's a good question, and we'll come to it in a second, but let's begin with an even bigger one: is the prime minister continuing to mislead the public over the budget? The details are a bit complex but ultimately this all comes back to a rather simple question: why did the government raise taxes in last week's budget? To judge from the prime minister's responses at a news conference just this morning, you might have judged that the answer is: \"because we had to\". \"There was an OBR productivity review,\" he explained to one journalist. \"The result of that was there was £16bn less than we might otherwise have had. That's a difficult starting point for any budget.\" Politics latest: OBR boss resigns over budget leak  Time and time again throughout the news conference, he repeated the same point: the Office for Budget Responsibility had revised its forecasts for the UK economy and the upshot of that was that the government had a £16bn hole in its accounts. Keep that figure in your head for a bit, because it's not without significance. But for the time being, let's take a step back and recall that budgets are mostly about the difference between two numbers: revenues and expenditure; tax and spending. This government has set itself a fiscal rule - that it needs, within a few years, to ensure that, after netting out investment, the tax bar needs to be higher than the spending bar. At the time of the last budget, taxes were indeed higher than current spending, once the economic cycle is taken account of or, to put it in economists' language, there was a surplus in the cyclically adjusted current budget. The chancellor had met her fiscal rule, by £9.9bn. This, it's worth saying, is not a very large margin by which to meet your fiscal rule. A typical budget can see revisions and changes that would swamp that in one fell swoop. And part of the explanation for why there has been so much speculation about tax rises over the summer is that the chancellor left herself so little \"headroom\" against the rule. And since everyone could see debt interest costs were going up, it seemed quite plausible that the government would have to raise taxes. Then, over the summer, the OBR, whose job it is to make the official government forecasts, and to mark its fiscal homework, told the government it was also doing something else: reviewing the state of Britain's productivity. This set alarm bells ringing in Downing Street - and understandably. The weaker productivity growth is, the less income we're all earning, and the less income we're earning, the less tax revenues there are going into the exchequer. The early signs were that the productivity review would knock tens of billions of pounds off the chancellor's \"headroom\" - that it could, in one fell swoop, wipe off that £9.9bn and send it into the red. Read more:Main budget announcements - at a glanceEnter your salary to see how the budget affects you That is why stories began to brew through the summer that the chancellor was considering raising taxes. The Treasury was preparing itself for some grisly news. But here's the interesting thing: when the bad news (that productivity review) did eventually arrive, it was far less grisly than expected. True: the one-off productivity \"hit\" to the public finances was £16bn. But - and this is crucial - that was offset by a lot of other, much better news (at least from the exchequer's perspective). Higher wage inflation meant higher expected tax revenues, not to mention a host of other impacts. All told, when everything was totted up, the hit to the public finances wasn't £16bn but somewhere between £5bn and £6bn.  Why is that number significant? Because it's short of the chancellor's existing £9.9bn headroom. Or, to put it another way, the OBR's forecasting exercise was not enough to force her to raise taxes. The decision to raise taxes, in other words, came down to something else. It came down to the fact that the government U-turned on a number of its welfare reforms over the summer. It came down to the fact that they wanted to axe the two-child benefits cap. And, on top of this, it came down to the fact that they wanted to raise their \"headroom\" against the fiscal rules from £9.9bn to over £20bn. These are all perfectly logical reasons to raise tax - though some will disagree on their wisdom. But here's the key thing: they are the chancellor and prime minister's decisions. They are not knee-jerk responses to someone else's bad news. Yet when the prime minister explained his budget decisions, he focused mostly on that OBR report. In fact, worse, he selectively quoted the £16bn number from the productivity review without acknowledging that it was only one part of the story. That seems pretty misleading to me."

        "Content": "The US has agreed to spare the UK from threatened trade tariffs on pharmaceutical products. The announcement was made following months of uncertainty over whether exports from the UK, and elsewhere across Europe, would be subject to steep charges. Via the policy update, the UK has become the only country in the world to secure a zero per cent tariff on pharmaceuticals exported to the US. Tariffs are taxes imposed on imports into a country.  In return, the UK has agreed to increase the baseline threshold used to assess if medicines can be used by the NHS. Money latest: The earners most affected by £2k salary sacrifice cap The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) will increase the base threshold by 25%: from £20,000-£30,000 to £25,000-£35,000.  \n                  Billion-pound money laundering network operating in 28 towns and cities in UK\n                 \n                  Three men jailed after cocaine worth £26.5m found in boat in Somerset\n                 \n                  More than a dozen killed as US attacks alleged drug boats in Pacific 'on Donald Trump's orders'\n                  It means NICE will be able to approve medicines that deliver significant health improvements but might have been declined purely on cost-effectiveness grounds, the government said. This ​​​​could include breakthrough cancer treatments, therapies for rare diseases, and innovative approaches to conditions that have long been difficult to treat, it added.   This will give NICE the opportunity to approve more new medicines and allow a greater number of patients to benefit from them, the Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry (ABPI) said.  It pointed out that NICE's baseline cost-effectiveness threshold has not been increased for over 20 years.

US trade representative Jamieson Greer said the US \"will work to ensure that UK citizens have access to latest pharmaceutical breakthroughs\". The background   US President Donald Trump has long complained that Europe does not pay enough for US drugs. America and the UK agreed in May to seek a deal on the proviso that firms secured a better operating environment in Britain. Criticism includes the concern that firms lose out on revenue due to a pricing regime which prioritises low costs for the NHS over incentives to invest. In October, the science minister Patrick Vallance told MPs, as talks with the US continued, that many drugs available in the UK would see an \"inevitable\" price increase."

        "Content": " Labour MP Tulip Siddiq has been sentenced to two years in jail for corruption in Bangladesh. Ms Siddiq was accused of using her influence over her aunt, Sheikh Hasina, the country's former prime minister, to illegally secure plots of land for her family members in the suburbs of the capital, Dhaka. She was being tried in absentia. Her aunt, Sheikh Hasina, was ousted last year and has since been sentenced to death, although she fled to India before she could be arrested. Ms Siddiq, her niece, has described herself as \"collateral damage\" in the new Bangladesh government's campaign against Ms Hasina, and previously said the trial was based on \"fabricated accusations and driven by a clear political vendetta\". In response to the sentence on Monday, Ms Siddiq said the \"whole process has been flawed and farcical from the beginning to the end\". \"The outcome of this kangaroo court is as predictable as it is unjustified,\" she added. \"I hope this so-called 'verdict' will be treated with the contempt it deserves. \n                  Tokyo overtaken as world's biggest city\n                 \n                  Tulip Siddiq: Lawyers and former ministers warn of 'profound concerns' over Labour MP's trial\n                 \n                  Trump & The Prince: Why is the Saudi leader's visit to the White House so significant? \n                 \"My focus has always been my constituents in Hampstead and Highgate, and I refuse to be distracted by the dirty politics of Bangladesh.\" The Labour MP resigned her ministerial post earlier this year after facing calls to step down over links to Ms Hasina. She was later accused of illegally receiving a plot of land from her aunt. An investigation by Sir Keir Starmer's ethics adviser, Sir Laurie Magnus, did not find \"evidence of improprieties\". However, he said it was \"regrettable\" that Ms Siddiq had not been more alert to the \"potential reputational risks\" of the ties to her aunt. The UK does not have an extradition treaty in place with Bangladesh. Political correspondent When corruption allegations against Tulip Siddiq first started to emerge from Bangladesh, the Labour MP and then minister was reluctant to speak publicly. That's changed now, and her interview today shows she's clearly confident in her defence. Her hand has been strengthened by interventions from both the Labour Party and a group of high-profile UK lawyers. In many cases of this kind, you might expect Labour HQ to trot out the line that this was a \"personal matter for the individual in question\". However, today the party machine has rowed in behind their MP, making it clear that she won't be kicked out and saying that they \"cannot recognise this judgement\" because of concerns around the fairness of the proceedings. She has also been explicit that she is not considering her position as an MP. That said, ongoing noise around allegations of corruption is never ideal for an elected politician. So it remains unclear if a route back to a ministerial job will re-open for Ms Siddiq in the short term. While she won't be going to Bangladesh to clear her name, sources do suggest that a defamation claim against the authorities in Dhaka is being looked at. Former prime minister: Investigation 'corrupt' Awami League, a banned political party in Bangladesh, led by Ms Hasina, said that the verdicts were \"entirely predictable... just as other recent ACC (Anti-Corruption Commission) cases have been,\" and accused the commission of being led by \"desperate, unelected men\". Ms Hasina then added in a statement through the party: \"No country is free from corruption. But corruption needs to be investigated in a way that is not itself corrupt. \"The ACC has failed that test today. It is controlled by an unelected government run by the Awami League's political opponents. \"It has exclusively targeted members of the Awami League, or those seen to be sympathetic to our party, and done nothing to prosecute or even investigate the cronyism that has escalated in Bangladesh since Dr Mohammad Yunus and his so-called interim government took power.\" The former prime minister was handed a combined 21-year prison sentence in other corruption cases last week. 'Profound concerns' raised by British lawyers Last week, a group of prominent British lawyers and former cabinet ministers wrote an open letter raising \"profound concerns\" over Ms Siddiq's trial in Bangladesh. Barrister Cherie Blair, who is married to ex-prime minister Tony Blair, Sir Robert Buckland, who served as justice secretary, and Dominic Grieve, an ex-attorney general, wrote that the criminal proceedings against Ms Siddiq were \"artificial and a contrived and unfair way of pursuing a prosecution\". Asia correspondent Tulip Siddiq appears to have a target on her back. Many close to her powerful aunt, Sheikh Hasina, have started to feel the force of a legal system that seems keen to deliver a decisive bookmark to her rule.\n\n She led the country for 15 years before being ousted last year following bloody protests which left up to 1,400 people dead. As a minister in the UK, Tulip Siddiq was meant to fight corruption.\n\n But now, she's been found guilty of it in Bangladesh - a move she claims is the product of a political witch hunt. And the Labour MP is far from out of the woods.\n\n Ms Siddiq faces two more cases and prosecutors today told me both carry possible life sentences.\n\n But with no extradition treaty between the two countries, she's unlikely to serve any time behind bars.\n\n Both sides today sounded vindicated and defiant. There are many striking aspects to the case in Dhaka - not least her absence from it.\n\n There was also a striking lack of physical evidence presented.\n\n Instead, some of the process seemed to play out in the papers rather than the courtroom with Ms Siddiq branded a fugitive. That war of words looks set to intensify now.\n\n Read more from Sky News:Chancellor: 'Of course I didn't' lie about budget forecastsZelenskyy to make first official visit to Ireland The lawyers wrote that Ms Siddiq did not have a \"proper opportunity of defending herself\". \"She is being tried in her absence without justification and… the proceedings fall far short of standards of fairness recognised internationally,\" they said. The letter was also signed by high-profile lawyers Philippe Sands and Geoffrey Robertson. They called for the Bangladeshi authorities to put all the allegations to Ms Siddiq's lawyers \"so that she has a fair opportunity to address them\"."

Mr Jones added: \"The chancellor was very clear we needed more [headroom] than we've had in the past, so she took it from £10bn to over £20bn. \"That means that if there's a shock in the future, we have more cash put aside to be able to respond to it.\" Read more:Reeves says 'of course I didn't' lie about budgetReeves accused of deliberately making UK finances look worse The OBR told the chancellor on 31 October the spending gap had closed and the government would be running a £4.2bn surplus.

On Monday, Sir Keir will deliver a speech in which he is expected to defend the decisions made in the budget and say it \"moves forward the government's programme of national renewal\"."

        "Content": " Airbus fleets have returned to normal operations after a software issue that could have affected flight controls was fixed faster than expected.  The manufacturer issued an alert about the problem affecting the A320 family of aircraft on Friday after analysis of a flight involving an A320 showed \"intense solar radiation may corrupt data critical to the functioning of flight controls\". Dozens of airlines said they had carried out the snap software retrofit over the weekend, with Airbus confirming on Monday the \"vast majority\" of around 6,000 of its A320 fleet affected by the software issue had been modified.   \"We are working with our airline customers to support the modification of less than 100 remaining aircraft to ensure they can be returned to service,\" Airbus said. \"Airbus apologises for any challenges and delays caused to passengers and airlines by this event.\" Meanwhile, the manufacturer discovered an industrial quality issue affecting fuselage panels of several dozen A320-family aircraft, leading to a delay of some deliveries, industry sources said on Monday. There are said to be no indications the suspected production flaw has reached aircraft in service. The incident that triggered the software warning involved a JetBlue A320 plane flying from Cancun, Mexico, to Newark in the US on 30 October. That flight was diverted to Tampa International Airport after it suffered a flight control issue and experienced a sharp loss of altitude, which injured at least 15 passengers. \"Intense solar radiation\" is suspected of contributing to the flight's sudden drop in altitude. America's aviation watchdog issued an emergency order to immediately replace or modify the software, mirroring one from the European Union Aviation Safety Agency. Airbus is understood to have traced the issue to the ELAC (Elevator and Aileron Computer) system, which sends commands to elevators on the plane's tail. These in turn control the aircraft's pitch or nose angle. The fix involves A320 aircraft reverting to an earlier software version and Airbus stressed it would only take two to three hours for most planes. However, some jets will also need new hardware and therefore will be affected for longer, it said. Travellers experienced disruption over the weekend, as airlines cancelled flights to fix the issue. Disruption continues on Monday as JetBlue said it would cancel 20 flights as it worked to return 137 of 150 A320s to service, while Colombia's Avianca Airlines said it would continue to halt bookings for dates until 8 December. But several airlines revised down estimates of the number of planes impacted and of the time needed for the software tweak, fixing their aircraft sooner than anticipated. Airlines easyJet and Wizz Air said on Monday they had completed the updates over the weekend without cancelling any flights.

        "Content": "Weight loss injections have been conditionally recommended for treating obesity by the World Health Organization (WHO) for the first time. WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said the new guidance \"recognises that obesity is a chronic disease that can be treated with comprehensive and lifelong care\". While he said medication can't solve obesity on its own, the jabs could help millions overcome it - and reduce its associated harms. According to the health agency, more than one billion people around the world are affected by obesity. By 2030, it says that figure will rise to two billion.

However, the WHO stressed that access remains a major barrier, as even with increased production, GLP-1 therapies are projected to reach fewer than 10% of those who could benefit by 2030. The latest advice applies to adults with a Body Mass Index of 30 or higher, and the recommendations are for three agents - semaglutide, which is sold under the names Ozempic and Wegovy, tirzepatide, available as Mounjaro and Zepbound, and an older drug from the same class called liraglutide. In a conference call, the WHO said it would set out guidance for the treatment of obesity in children and adolescents next week. The move comes years after the UK licensed Wegovy as a weight loss drug in the UK and made it available on the NHS.

Also in August, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) - the body that provides guidance on the use of new drugs - said that people coming off the drugs should be offered \"structured advice and follow-up support\" to help prevent weight gain. This includes being monitored by the NHS for at least a year after completing treatment and support to help build \"long-term behavioural habits, use self-monitoring tools, and draw on wider support - from online communities to family-led interventions and local activities\"."

Age UK spoke to more than 2,600 people and found 11% will eat dinner alone on 25 December, while 5% will not see or speak to anyone the whole day. Applied to the overall population, the findings suggest 1.5 million people will eat alone at Christmas, according to the charity. Dame Joanna said the \"silence can be deafening\" for those left isolated and called it \"a crisis hidden in plain sight\". The actor and campaigner is now joining other luminaries including Dame Judi Dench, Brian Cox and Miriam Margolyes to back Age UK's campaign against loneliness. The charity says its volunteers made more than 70,000 minutes' worth of calls to people during Christmas week last year and is urging people to donate. 'A tragedy we don't talk about enough' Age UK said it also supports coffee mornings and festive lunches to give lonely people the chance to enjoy in-person interaction. Dame Judi said: \"For so many older people, Christmas can be a time of silence - days without conversation or company.\" Succession star Brian Cox called the issue \"a tragedy we don't talk about enough\". He said: \"Far too many older people are left spending the season in silence, when it should be a time of warmth, connection and joy.\" Margolyes, of Harry Potter fame, added: \"Growing older shouldn't mean disappearing into the background, we need to be seen, heard and celebrated. \"That's what Age UK is striving for - they're changing how we perceive age.\" Read more:What counts as a white Christmas?CCTV shows festive thief The charity's chief executive, Paul Farmer, said: \"Your donation could bring comfort, friendship, and care to an older person facing loneliness this winter. \"From friendly, weekly calls to local lunch clubs, we're here to make sure no one spends winter alone.

The reindeer had escaped a festive event in Formby early on Saturday afternoon, with Southport Offshore Rescue Trust receiving a call at around 4.45pm to assist in the search. Named Buddy, it was spotted on nearby roads as it made its way to the beach, according to Merseyside Police. The force was concerned the reindeer might end up in a nearby river, so they called in the lifeboat quad team, as well as coastguard teams from HM Coastguard Southport and HM Coastguard Crosby to help.  The Southport Offshore Rescue Trust team managed to locate the animal using thermal binoculars and then used quad bikes to shepherd it into some nearby sand dunes, where a police drone was used to monitor the animal. After it lay down in the sand dunes to rest, a vet travelled from Salisbury, Wiltshire, with sedatives, and plans were made to tranquilise the animal and then get it in a trailer and back to its stable. \n                  Zipcar set to close UK operations - but Christmas bookings are safe\n                 \n                  Dame Joanna Lumley warns of 'crisis hidden in plain sight' - with 1.5 million older people set to spend Christmas alone\n                 \n                  What counts as a white Christmas - and how likely is one this year?\n                 The vet was supported by the Royal Marines, who were on exercise in a nearby firing range, and managed to sedate the animal at around 1.20am on Sunday morning.

        "Content": "Don't get too upset, but 'rage bait' has been named by Oxford University Press as this year's Word of the Year, beating other online terms. The group behind the Oxford English Dictionary says the term is a noun which describes online content \"deliberately designed to elicit anger or outrage\" to boost traffic or engagement. You might be asking - isn't that two words? The publisher says it's not tricking you, and adds that it's one word when used as a hyphenated compound phrase. Online content deliberately designed to elicit anger or outrage by being frustrating, provocative, or offensive, typically posted in order to increase traffic to or engagement with a particular web page or social media account. Why 'rage bait'? Casper Grathwohl, president of Oxford Languages, said that \"the fact that the word rage bait exists and has seen such a dramatic surge in usage means we're increasingly aware of the manipulation tactics we can be drawn into online\". He added: \"Before, the internet was focused on grabbing our attention by sparking curiosity in exchange for clicks, but now we've seen a dramatic shift to it hijacking and influencing our emotions, and how we respond. \"It feels like the natural progression in an ongoing conversation about what it means to be human in a tech-driven world -and the extremes of online culture.\" \n                  PM issues China warning - and hits out at Brexit\n                 \n                  OBR chief Richard Hughes resigns after budget leak investigation\n                 \n                  Is Starmer continuing to mislead public over the budget?\n                 It's the latest online term to be recognised by Oxford University Press - last year, the publisher picked 'brain rot,' and in 2023 picked 'rizz'. Every year, Oxford University Press names a new word of the year, with some picks confusing many. Here's a list of Oxford's picks dating back over ten years - how many do you recognise? 2015: 😂 ('Face with Tears of Joy') - The first time a picture was selected, Oxford said that it \"best reflected the ethos, mood, and preoccupations\" of the year. 2016: post-truth (adjective) - Defined as \"relating to and denoting circumstances in which objective facts are less influential in shaping public opinion than appeals to emotion and personal belief\". 2017: youthquake (noun) - Defined as \"a significant cultural, political, or social change arising from the actions or influence of young people\". 2018: toxic (adjective) - Already strictly defined as \"poisonous,\" the term was recognised for its growing use in describing unhealthy relationships. 2019: climate emergency (noun) - Defined as \"a situation in which urgent action is required to reduce or halt climate change and avoid potentially irreversible environmental damage resulting from it\".\n\n 2020: No word chosen - The publisher said that the year was not one \"that could neatly be accommodated in one\" phrase, but did have a report on the COVID-19 pandemic and social justice protests. 2021: Vax (verb/noun) - Defined as either \"a vaccine or vaccination\" or as to \"treat (someone) with a vaccine to produce immunity against a disease\". 2022: goblin mode (slang noun) - Selected by online vote, it is a term defined as \"a type of behaviour which is unapologetically self-indulgent, lazy, slovenly, or greedy, typically in a way that rejects social norms or expectations\". 2023: rizz (noun) - Defined as \"style, charm, or attractiveness; the ability to attract a romantic or sexual partner\". 2024: brain rot (noun) - Defined as the \"supposed deterioration of a person's mental or intellectual state, especially viewed as a result of overconsumption of material (now particularly online content) considered to be trivial or unchallenging\". Mr Grathwohl said that while brain rot \"captured the mental drain of endless scrolling, rage bait shines a light on the content purposefully engineered to spark outrage and drive clicks\". \"And together, they form a powerful cycle where outrage sparks engagement, algorithms amplify it, and constant exposure leaves us mentally exhausted,\" he added. \"These words don't just define trends, they reveal how digital platforms are reshaping our thinking and behaviour.\" What else was on the shortlist? The other two options also stemmed from the internet, and were as follows... • Aura farming (noun): The cultivation of an impressive, attractive or charismatic persona or public image by behaving or presenting oneself in a way intended subtly to convey an air of confidence, coolness or mystique. • Biohack (verb): To attempt to improve or optimise one's physical or mental performance, health, longevity or wellbeing by altering one's diet, exercise routine, or lifestyle or by using other means such as drugs, supplements, or technological devices. Aura farming has its origins in social media and was first used in 2023. During the general election last year, the Labour Party even made a TikTok about former prime minister Rishi Sunak being an \"auramancer\". As a term, biohack has been around for a fair bit longer, but has come to prominence as entrepreneurs seek to find ways to beat ageing and share their attempts online. The three contenders were put to a public vote on Instagram, which then helped Oxford University Press's language experts make their final decision.

While Oxford University Press has backed 'rage bait,' others have said differently, with Collins naming 'vibe coding' the word of the year. That term refers to an emerging software development process that turns natural language into computer code using AI, and was coined by Andrej Karpathy, former director of AI at Tesla and a founding engineer at OpenAI. Cambridge Dictionary, meanwhile, said its word of the year is 'parasocial' - meaning a connection someone feels between themselves and a famous person they do not know. That came after a 2024 study revealed that while people found their emotional needs were still best met by friends and family, parasocial relationships with YouTubers were valued more than relationships with \"real\" acquaintances or colleagues."
