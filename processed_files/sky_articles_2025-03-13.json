        "Content": "\n          News reporter\n              @samuelosborne93\n  Vladimir Putin has said Russia agrees to an end to fighting in Ukraine, but \"lots of questions\" remain over proposals for a 30-day ceasefire. Casting doubt over whether a deal can be agreed, the Russian president said a ceasefire must lead to \"long-term peace\" which \"would remove the initial reasons for the crisis\". Russia has previously said it would not accept Ukraine joining NATO and European peacekeepers in Ukraine. Moscow has reportedly also presented a \"list of demands\" to the US to end the war, which would include international recognition of Russia's claim to Crimea and four Ukrainian provinces. Ukraine's president Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Mr Putin's remarks were \"very predictable\" and \"very manipulative\", adding that the Russian president was preparing to reject the ceasefire proposal he agreed with the US. Mr Putin's comments came as Donald Trump's envoy Steve Witkoff arrived in Moscow ahead of talks over Ukraine with the Russian president. Ukraine war latest updates Speaking on Thursday afternoon, Mr Putin described the situation in Russia's Kursk region, where Ukrainian troops have pushed into Moscow's territory, as \"completely under our control\". It appeared the US had persuaded Ukraine to accept the ceasefire, he said, but Ukraine is also interested because of the battlefield situation, with its forces in Kursk fully blocked in the coming days. \"In these conditions, I believe it would be good for the Ukrainian side to secure a ceasefire for at least 30 days,\" he said. He also said there would need to be a mechanism to control possible breaches of the truce. Another issue he raised was whether Ukraine could use the 30-day ceasefire to continue to mobilise and rearm. He said he would need to speak to Mr Trump over the terms of any ceasefire. Moscow correspondent Vladimir Putin was never going to flat out reject the US proposal for a ceasefire, but he also wasn't going to fully endorse it either. Russia’s agreement, as expected, comes with several strings attached. The Kremlin leader didn't specify Moscow’s demands but he did allude to them by saying that any peace deal had to eliminate the \"root causes\" of the conflict. It's become a frequent refrain of his, and shows that Moscow's maximalist position hasn't changed. By \"root causes\", the Russian president is referring to NATO's eastward expansion, which he blames as the catalyst for the war in Ukraine. It's a very clear indication his agreement to a ceasefire relies on getting some kind of security guarantees of his own, for example a promise Ukraine will never join NATO, or that there'll never be any European peacekeeping forces from NATO members based in the country in the future. He also articulated why Moscow is reluctant to agree to an immediate truce, talking at length about his forces' advances in Kursk region. Ukraine's incursion there has been humiliating for the Kremlin, but their expulsion is finally within reach. Mr Putin doesn't want that opportunity to slip away. By pausing Russia's offensive, he fears they'll lose the advantage and give the enemy time to regroup. Mr Putin was, however, careful to thank Donald Trump for his efforts in trying to reach a peace agreement, perhaps wary of any backlash from the White House. But despite that, he still doesn't appear to be showing any sign of compromise. Mr Putin was speaking alongside Belarus's President Alexander Lukashenko and the pair said in a joint statement that NATO's actions regarding the war in Ukraine were fraught with the risk of nuclear conflict. The two countries also criticised the European Union's policy towards Russia, labelling it aggressive and confrontational.  Russia's invasion of Ukraine in early 2022 has left thousands of people dead and injured, millions displaced and towns and cities reduced to rubble. Moscow's forces have been advancing since the middle of last year and now control nearly a fifth of Ukraine's territory. In his speech Mr Putin said Russian forces were pushing forwards along the entire frontline. Responding to the comments, Mr Zelenskyy said: \"Putin, of course, is afraid to say directly to President Trump that he wants to continue this war, he wants to kill Ukrainians.\" He said Mr Putin's words were \"just another Russian manipulation\". Mr Trump also responded to the remarks, saying Mr Putin's statement was not complete and reiterated his willingness to talk to the Russian president, adding: \"Hopefully Russia will do the right thing.\" In a news conference with NATO secretary general Mark Rutte, the US president shifted his tone on the alliance, saying it was \"stepping up\" and praising Mr Rutte for doing \"some really good work\". Mr Rutte said NATO members needed to produce more weapons, stating the alliance was not doing enough and was lagging behind Russia and China.  It comes after Mr Putin donned a camouflage uniform to visit a command post in the Kursk region on Wednesday."

        "Content": " Wes Streeting has admitted he did not anticipate scrapping NHS England when he became health secretary but said it is a \"necessary step\". Before Labour won last summer's election, Mr Streeting said he had \"absolutely no intention of wasting time with a big costly reorganisation\" of the NHS. However, hours after Sir Keir Starmer dropped the bombshell that NHS England, the administrative body that runs the national health service, will be abolished to slash red tape, the health secretary said his mind had been changed. Politics latest: Mood in NHS England 'very low today' He told Trevor Phillips on Sky News' Politics Hub: \"I didn't anticipate coming in wanting to make this change to NHS England. It wasn't on my list of priorities. \"I recognise that in order to achieve the change I want, this is a necessary step.\" He said his instincts were to not scrap the quango \"unless it was necessary\". \"I've concluded that it is necessary because you can't have a situation where you've got two head offices duplicating work, a man marking each other, sometimes working against each other,\" he added.  9,000 plus will lose jobs Mr Streeting also confirmed thousands of people will lose their jobs, answering \"yes\" when asked if the move means more than 9,000 civil servants will be out the door - around half of the 19,000 people the health secretary said work for NHS England and the Department of Health and Social Care. He acknowledged it \"will be an anxious time for them...there's no way of sugarcoating\" it. \"But we will be treating people with care and respect and the fairness that they are owned through this process,\" he said. He said the Conservatives inherited the \"shortest waiting times and the highest patient satisfaction in history\" when they won the 2010 election, but said they \"turned it on its head\". He claimed the Labour government \"is fixing it\" but added: \"We do have to put a foot down on the accelerator.\" The health secretary reiterated his previous comments that it would \"be daft not to use spare capacity in the private sector\" to alleviate pressure on the NHS. Read more:What is NHS England and what does abolishing it mean?'No return to austerity' after NHS announcement  However, he denied getting rid of NHS England is about part privatisation of the health service. \"With Labour, it would always be a public service free at the points of use,\" he said. \"There are lots of people who are now paying to go private, and it's those who can't afford it who are getting left behind. I want to end that two-tier system.\" Sir Keir said axing NHS England will bring management of the NHS \"back into democratic control\" as it returns to the Department of Health and Social Care 12 years after the Conservatives created it. The prime minister said the result would end the duplication from two organisations doing the same job, freeing up staff to focus on patients and putting more resources on the frontline.

        "Content": "\n          Political editor\n              @BethRigby\n  When Sir Keir Starmer landed in Hull on Thursday as the latest prime minister proposing to reshape the state, he wanted to show he meant it, announcing he was abolishing the world's largest quango - NHS England (and with it 9,000 jobs). Significant, decisive and designed to make the point - the prime minister grabbed attention for the argument that he wanted to make around tackling an \"ever-expanding\" state that was, in his words, \"weaker\" than it has ever been, and failing to serve the public properly. This is his diagnosis and his remedy, reform: dispensing of regulators, cutting red tape, injecting artificial intelligence in the backbone of the state to improve efficiency and cut costs (and jobs). Politics latest: Thousands to lose jobs as PM abolishes NHS England On most of this he was vague - heavy on rhetoric but light on detail, but the symbolism of abolishing NHS England was clear for all to see: this prime minister is borrowing from a Conservative playbook in an effort to improve services through deregulation, public service cuts and a bonfire of red tape.  Sir James Bethell, a Conservative peer and former health minister, retweeted the prime minister's announcement on scrapping NHS England with the words: \"I wish we'd had the guts to do this.\" Sir Keir is also signalling he's prepared to have a fight - not just with the \"blockers\" or the \"NIMBYs\", but with his own party, public sector workers and the unions as he takes a scalpel to the state. \n                  Ministers 'determined to fix broken benefits system' - as welfare cuts expected\n                 \n                  New planning bill could be the government's most important - but will it work in practice?\n                 \n                  Mike Amesbury to quit as MP after punching man in street - triggering by-election\n                 Reforms are ultimately about winning a second term The prime minister said every arm's-length governmental body was up for review - and also, in a couple of weeks, he will take aim at the burgeoning welfare budget in an effort to find billions in savings as he looks to deal with the squeeze on the public finances through spending cuts rather than tax rises or loosening his chancellor's self-imposed borrowing rules. Taking on the state in one form or the other is something many a Conservative prime minister, not least Liz Truss, have often talked about, and now Sir Keir is adopting this approach. But for him, the ultimate pragmatist, this is not about ideology but something else - delivery, and ultimately, trying to win a second term.  This is him explaining his motivations to his cabinet in a letter he sent to all his ministers last month: \"Politics is no longer built around a traditional left-right axis. It is instead being reimagined around a disruptor - disrupted axis. If governments are not changing the system in favour of working people, then voters will find someone else who does. \"We need to be disruptors - on behalf of those ordinary, working people who just want more security in their lives and a country that is on its way back up again. \"That means taking on vested interests of all kinds, it means challenging laws that hold Britain back, stripping back regulation that stifles progress, moving power out of Westminster and back to communities across the country. It means standing up for ordinary people who feel shut out and ignored by elites. Whenever we see barriers to renewal, this government will tear them down.\" At its heart is the admission from the prime minister that if his government doesn't deliver, the winners will be Reform UK, or even a revived Conservative opposition. Starmer prepared to fight for his public sector reforms But as much as he makes this argument, there will be many in his party, in the union movement, and who voted Labour who hear the word austerity when they hear Sir Keir say \"reform\". That's why I asked him, at the event in Hull, whether this drive was a return to austerity, or, at the very least, will appear that to those on the receiving end of these cuts. Read more:What is NHS England - and what does abolishing it mean?MPs vote to scrap key part of assisted dying billStarmer says welfare bill is 'indefensible' After all, at the general election manifesto launch, when I asked the prime minister whether there would be a return to austerity under a Labour government, he vowed: \"There will not be austerity under a Starmer government.\" On Thursday, he insisted there would be \"no return to austerity\".  \"Part of the problem we've got with our public services is what was done to them a decade or so ago. So we're not going down that route, and none of our plans are going down that route,\" he said. But when those welfare cuts are announced later this month, Sir Keir's \"reforms\" might look rather different, as might his plans for public sector reform if thousands of workers lose their jobs. What was clear as he made his argument on Thursday is that it's a fight he's prepared to have."

An investigation into corporate manslaughter was launched in October 2023 following the trial and conviction of ex-nurse Letby. But Cheshire Constabulary have now widened their probe to determine whether gross negligence manslaughter took place. While corporate manslaughter covers cases where a corporation's negligence leads to a person's death, gross negligence manslaughter is when an individual's negligence causes death. In a statement, Detective Superintendent Paul Hughes said: \"This is a separate offence to corporate manslaughter and focuses on the grossly negligent action or inaction of individuals. \"It is important to note that this does not impact on the convictions of Lucy Letby for multiple offences of murder and attempted murder.\" Det Supt Hughes added: \"Those identified as suspects have been notified. We will not be confirming the number of people involved or their identity as no arrests or charges have yet been made. \"Both the corporate manslaughter and gross negligence manslaughter elements of the investigation are continuing and there are no set timescales for these. \"Our investigation into the deaths and non-fatal collapses of babies at the neo-natal units of both the Countess of Chester Hospital and the Liverpool Women's Hospital between the period of 2012 to 2016 is also ongoing. \"Our priority is to maintain the integrity of our ongoing investigations and to support the many families who are at the heart of these.\" Letby, 35, from Hereford, is serving 15 whole-life orders after she was convicted across two trials at Manchester Crown Court of killing seven babies, and attempting to murder seven others - making two attempts on one of her victims - between June 2015 and June 2016.  Last month an international panel of neonatologists and paediatric specialists said bad medical care and natural causes were the reasons for the collapses and deaths. Their evidence has been passed to the Criminal Cases Review Commission (CCRC), which investigates potential miscarriages of justice, and Letby's legal team hope her case will be referred back to the Court of Appeal. A public inquiry into the events surrounding Letby's crimes will reconvene at Liverpool Town Hall on 17 March for closing submissions, and the findings of Lady Justice Thirlwall are expected this autumn. A spokesperson at the Countess of Chester Hospital NHS Foundation Trust said: \"Due to the Thirlwall Inquiry and the ongoing police investigations, it would not be appropriate to comment further at this time.\""

        "Content": " A teenager who stabbed a 15-year-old girl to death in a row over a teddy bear cried in the dock as he was jailed for at least 23 years. Hassan Sentamu, 18, had a history of attacking girls and carrying knives before he killed Elianne Andam near the Whitgift Centre in central Croydon in September 2023. Elianne had stood up for his ex-girlfriend, who was her friend. Following Sentamu's sentencing at the Old Bailey today, the girl's father, Michael Andam, told the court how the \"thought of her final moments torments me\". He added that he wondered if she was \"hoping I would save her\" before telling the court: \"I couldn't protect her. \"That guilt will weigh on my heart for the rest of my life.\" Elianne was repeatedly stabbed in what police described as a \"frenzied\" attack that was caught on CCTV. Sentamu, who was 17 at the time, was arrested less than 90 minutes later after getting off a bus. The boy, of Rowdown Crescent, New Addington, admitted manslaughter but denied murder on the basis of \"loss of control\" because he has autism. He was found guilty of murder and possession of a knife in January following a trial at the Old Bailey. Sentamu had recently broken up with a friend of Elianne's, whom he had agreed to meet up with to return items, including a teddy bear, that they exchanged while they were going out together, the court heard. But he instead came armed with a knife, wearing two pairs of gloves and a facemask. When the ex-girlfriend, who cannot be named for legal reasons, asked for her belongings, she says he refused to hand them over and replied: \"I don't want to hurt you.\" The girl says she then started asking him for her teddy bear before Elianne ran up behind him and grabbed a bag of items that had been returned to him. She added that Elianne then started \"running and laughing as a joke\" before Sentamu chased her and stabbed her multiple times. The day before the killing, he had seen the girls at the Whitgift Centre where they \"teased\" him and his ex-girlfriend threw water on him. Seething at the perceived disrespect, he told a friend he could not \"let this slide\". Read more:Sentamu says he would 'do it again', court hearsElianne Andam posted video on Snapchat before fatal stabbing  In a televised sentencing, Mrs Justice Cheema-Grubb said Elianne, an aspiring lawyer, was a \"hard-working, happy girl\" with a \"radiant smile\". She told the defendant: \"Elianne was 15 when you murdered her, she will always remain just 15, she will never realise the potential of her life.\" His actions were due to his \"short temper and aggressive tendencies\" which combined with his \"deliberate decision to carry a knife,\" the judge said. Sentamu sat with head in his hands in the dock and wiped away tears as he was sentenced to life in prison and told he must serve at least 23 years. Elianne's family criticised the sentence outside court, saying it had left them feeling \"abandoned and unheard\". Mark Rossell, a pastor, said on behalf of the family: \"We cannot accept such lenient sentences are appropriate for violent calculated crimes like this.\" 'The music has stopped' Earlier the family described their \"living nightmare\" in a series of statements read to the court. Her mother Dorcas Andam said: \"Elianne was my world, she was the kindest most loving daughter I could have asked for. She was vibrant, creative and purposeful. \"She loved deeply, loved to sing, braided hair, and always practised new styles. Our home was full of her music, laughter and energy. There was always warmth and joy when Elianne was there. \"Now the music has stopped, the laughter has gon, and all that is left is a deafening silence that echoes through my life.\" Addressing Sentamu, Mrs Andam added: \"You brutally murdered her in the most humiliating way in broad daylight. \"Mercilessly killing her on the floor as she begged for mercy. You walked away showing no remorse as if her life meant nothing. \"You did not only kill Elianne, you killed me mentally and emotionally. Your actions were senseless and evil.\" Father speaks of torment Meanwhile, Elianne's father told the court: \"I close my eyes and see the horror of what she must have endured - the fear, the pain - and it breaks me over and over again. \"No parents should ever have to bury their child, let alone in such a violent and cruel manner. The thought of her final moments torments me - wondering if she was calling out for me, hoping I would save her - but I wasn't there. I couldn't protect her. \"That guilt will weigh on my heart for the rest of my life.\" Elianne's cousin Denzil Larbi told the defendant: \"What you did was the most monstrous and evil act that is imaginable. You will forever remain a villain in our story.\" Met Police Detective Chief Inspector Becky Woodsford, who led the investigation, said after sentencing: \"Today marks the end of a very long journey for Elianne's family and friends, and while this is the best outcome they could have hoped for, nothing will ease the immeasurable pain they continue to live with on a daily basis. \"Since Elianne was taken from them in the most incomprehensible way, they have been driven by a motivation to see her killer brought to justice. Getting to this point has been challenging for them, and I would like to pay testament to their continued dignity, determination and composure.\""

        "Content": " Jewish protesters have stormed Trump Tower in the city of New York, demanding the release of a pro-Palestinian activist arrested by immigration officials. At least 150 people poured into the building's lobby in midtown Manhattan to demonstrate against the detention of Mahmoud Khalil, who led Columbia University protests in 2024 against Israel's war in Gaza. The group from Jewish Voice for Peace carried banners, wore red shirts reading \"Jews say stop arming Israel\" and chanted \"Bring Mahmoud home now!\" Local police said 98 were arrested on charges including trespassing, obstruction and resisting arrest. Donald Trump previously described Mr Khalil, 30, who has lawful permanent resident status in the US, as \"anti-American\". He is married to an American citizen. The postgraduate student, from Columbia University's school of international and public affairs, has been a prominent figure in the university's pro-Palestinian student protest movement. This week, his deportation was put on hold while his lawyers challenged his detention at an immigration detention centre in Louisiana. On Saturday, he was arrested outside his university residence in Upper Manhattan. \n                  Donald Trump says he thinks US will annex Greenland\n                 \n                  The legal proceedings against Mahmoud Khalil are an American tolerance test\n                 \n                  Trump threatens EU with 200% tariffs on alcohol - including wine and champagne\n                 He has not been charged with a crime. US secretary of state Marco Rubio has claimed he has reasonable grounds to believe Mr Khalil's activities or presence in the country could have \"serious adverse foreign policy consequences\".  On Thursday, Mr Khalil's lawyers asked a federal judge to release him from immigration detention. They argued that President Trump's administration targeted him for deportation because of his activism, and his detention is a violation of the US Constitution's First Amendment protections for freedom of speech. US correspondent There's more to this story than the story itself. In Donald Trump's USA, the proceedings against Mahmoud Khalil are an American tolerance test. At the heart of it is the US Constitution itself and the First Amendment that enshrines the right to free speech. Mahmoud Khalil is the measure of where it starts and where it ends - the fate of others will turn on his test case. As President Trump put it, his arrest is the first of \"many to come\", citing students who had \"engaged in pro-terrorist, antisemitic, anti-American activity\". Read more from James here. Separately, his lawyers asked the court to block Columbia University from sharing student disciplinary records from campus protests with a Republican-led US House of Representatives committee. Mr Khalil's case has become a flashpoint for Mr Trump's pledge to deport some activists who participated in the wave of protests on US college campuses against Israel's military assault on Gaza following the October 2023 attack by the militant group Hamas. Read more from Sky News:Trump thinks US will annex GreenlandHow will Trump's tariffs affect the UK?US politicians' outcry over Apple security Mr Trump's administration has said pro-Palestinian protests on college campuses, including at Columbia, have included support for Hamas and antisemitic harassment of Jewish students. Last week, the administration said it cancelled grants and contracts worth about $400m (£309m) to Columbia because of what it describes as antisemitic harassment on and near the school's campus. Student protest organisers have said criticism of Israel and its actions is being wrongly conflated with antisemitism."

        "Content": "\n          Science and technology editor\n              @t0mclark3\n Technically, the hundred-mile-long, 20 mile-wide British overseas territory of South Georgia is uninhabited. Only a few visiting scientists and government fisheries inspectors occupy the island all year round. But from a wildlife perspective, it's anything but. Its shores are home to the largest number of marine birds and mammals on the planet. The impact of the world's biggest iceberg Lying 800 miles east off the Falkland Islands and a thousand miles north of Antarctica, it's one of the few fragments of land between that vast frozen continent and the rest of the world.  The part of the South Atlantic in which it sits is one of the most food-rich oceans in the world, fed by powerful circulating currents, and it's full of shrimp-like Antarctic krill. \"Krill feeds the blue whales, humpback whales, fin whales. It also feeds the gentoo penguins, macaroni penguins, chinstrap penguins and the fur seals,\" says Martin Collins, a scientist with the British Antarctic Survey, and former head of the South Georgia government, speaking to me from his office at King Edward Point on the island. The island also has some of the largest and most significant populations of elephant seals, king penguins and several species of albatross and petrel - the hardiest of ocean-going seabirds. The island has been in the headlines after the world's largest iceberg, A23a, ran aground off its south-west coast.  Concern over impact of iceberg on island's wildlife There's a concern it could impact wildlife on the island - but the timing is fortuitous, says Mr Collins. \"It's the end of the breeding season now, which means the impacts on penguins at that part of the island will be lessened. \"There may be a little bit of impact, particularly on gentoo penguins, which still forage around the island during the winter.\" From a wider conservation point of view, South Georgia is one of the world's stand-out success stories. Until the 1960s, it was a major hub for whaling. Thousands of whales were caught off its coasts and processed at a number of whaling stations - the scale of the slaughter such that the bays around the island were red with whale blood. The whalers introduced reindeer for food that nibbled and trampled unique plant life that sustained many of the island's endemic wildlife. Stowaway rats plundered the eggs and chicks of penguins and other ground nesting birds (there are no trees).  Whales returning in large numbers The South Georgia pipit, the world's most southerly songbird, was driven to the brink of extinction. But before the abandoned whaling stations have even rusted away, whales have begun returning to South Georgia in large numbers. A campaign of air-dropping poisoned bait across the inaccessible island has eradicated the rats and the pipits are booming. The seas around South Georgia were once heavily fished. The worst for wildlife were long-line vessels trying to hook high-value Chilean seabass. Call for outright ban on fishing Albatross and petrels would dive for the bait and be caught and drowned. Since 2012, the government of South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands have policed a 500,000 square-mile marine-protected area around the islands where most fishing is now banned. A few vessels are licensed to catch shrimp-like krill and seabass but only in winter when most predators are absent and under strict controls. Some conservationists are calling for fishing to be banned outright. However, the South Georgia government argues it's the income from limited fishing licences that allows them to protect and monitor the exclusion zone. Crucial at a time when funding from central government is scarce and unlikely to increase. The key threat now is the rapidly changing climate around South Georgia. \"There's evidence that the distribution of krill is moving a little further south gradually over time,\" says Mr Collins. \"We need to be really mindful of that changing climate.\" But he's optimistic too. Despite warmer oceans, numbers of some species are booming. Especially whales and fur seals. \"I've just had two king penguins walking past the windows as we were talking,\" he says. \"When I first came here in the late 1990s, there were no fur seals in this area at all. And now they're everywhere around us\"."

        "Content": "The Columbine High School massacre has officially claimed another life - nearly 26 years after the US mass shooting. The death last month of Anne Marie Hochhalter, who was left partially paralysed by two gunshot wounds in the attack, has been ruled a homicide by the Jefferson County Coroner's Office. On 16 February this year, the 43-year-old woman died in her Denver home of sepsis - a reaction to infection. And complications from the paralysis were a \"significant contributing factor\" in her death, forensic pathologist Dr Dawn B Holmes wrote in a 13-page post-mortem report. Dr Holmes ruled that \"the manner of death is best classified as homicide\". Columbine death toll rises to 14 It takes the death toll from the 20 April 1999 school shooting in Littleton, Colorado, to 14, including 13 students and one teacher. \n                  Father watching school athletics killed by hammer weight in Colorado\n                 \n                  More than 170 skiers and snowboarders rescued after ski lift cracks in Colorado\n                 \n                  JonBenet Ramsey: Unsolved 1996 killing of six-year-old girl still being investigated, police say\n                 The total does not include the gunmen, Dylan Klebold, 17, and Eric Harris, 18, who killed themselves before police could arrest them. At the time of the attack, Ms Hochhalter was a 17-year-old student who was eating lunch with friends when she was shot in the chest and back. She suffered wounds that left her paralysed from the waist down.

Ms Hochhalter struggled with intense pain, but fought hard to overcome the complications of her injuries and remain positive, according to family and friends. In 2016, she decided to forgive the mother of gunman Dylan Klebold. She wrote in a letter to Sue Klebold: \"'A good friend once told me, 'Bitterness is like swallowing a poison pill and expecting the other person to die.' It only harms yourself. I have forgiven you and only wish you the best.\" When she died, her family and friends suspected her death was due to natural causes related to her injuries in the shooting. Due to the role her paralysis was suspected of playing in her death, the investigation was transferred to the office that also reviewed the deaths in the school shooting. The others killed at Columbine were teacher William \"Dave\" Sanders, 47, and students Cassie Bernall, 17, Steve Curnow, 14, Corey DePooter, 17, Kelly Fleming, 16, Matt Kechter, 16, Daniel Mauser, 15, Daniel Rohrbough, 15, Rachel Scott, 17, Isaiah Shoels, 18, John Tomlin, 16, and Kyle Velasquez, 16."

        "Content": " Measles cases in Europe and Central Asia doubled last year compared to 2023, the World Health Organisation (WHO) and UNICEF have warned in what is being called a \"wake-up call\". There were 127,350 reported infections in the region in 2024, which is the highest number since 1997. It is around a third of last year's total worldwide cases of 359,521. More than 40% of the European cases were children under five, as the two global bodies appealed for urgent action to increase vaccination levels. In 2023, half a million children across the region missed the first dose of the vaccine (MCV1) that should be given through routine immunisation services, said the organisations. Two doses of the measles vaccine are believed to be 97% effective in preventing the disease, which typically affects the respiratory system and leads to symptoms such as fever, cough, runny nose and a rash. Measles is one of the most contagious viruses for humans.

'Measles is back' WHO's Europe director Dr Hans Kluge said: \"Measles is back, and it's a wake-up call.\" He added: \"Without high vaccination rates, there is no health security... The measles virus never rests - and neither can we.\" The nation with the most infections last year was Romania which had 30,692, followed by Kazakhstan with 28,147. Read more:Mum urges parents to vaccinate childen after baby 'struggled to breathe'  Fewer than 80% of eligible children in Bosnia and Herzegovina, Montenegro, North Macedonia and Romania were vaccinated with MCV1 in 2023 - which is well below the 95% coverage rate needed to prevent an outbreak. In Montenegro, fewer than 50% of children have been vaccinated against measles for at least the past five years. In Bosnia and Herzegovina, the figure was less than 70%. UK officials said last month there have been more than 200 reported cases in the country and that many more were expected. Vaccination rates not back to pre-pandemic levels Measles cases in the region have generally been declining since 1997, when 216,000 were reported, reaching a low of 4,440 cases in 2016, according to the WHO and UNICEF. However, a resurgence was seen in 2018 and 2019 with 89,000 and 106,000 cases reported for those years respectively. After a drop in immunisation coverage during the COVID pandemic, cases rose significantly again in 2023 and 2024. Vaccination rates in many countries are yet to return to pre-pandemic levels, increasing the risk of outbreaks.

A rash usually appears a few days after the cold-like symptoms. The rash starts on the face and behind the ears before spreading to the rest of the body.\n\n A person is infectious from when they first have symptoms (around four days before the rash appears) until four days after they get the rash. There are things people can do to reduce the risk of spreading or catching measles. Do:\nWash hands often with soap and warm water.\nUse tissues when coughing or sneezing.\nThrow used tissues in the bin. Don't:\nDo not share cutlery, cups, towels, clothes, or bedding. Information from NHS website 'Never too late to be vaccinated' Concerns about the safety of the measles vaccine have lingered for decades, after British physician Dr Andrew Wakefield and colleagues published a paper in 1998 - which has long since been retracted - linking the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine to autism. No evidence for any causal link has ever been found and Wakefield had his licence to practise medicine in the UK revoked. \"It's never too late to get vaccinated,\" said Dr Ben Kasstan-Dabush, from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, who warned that misinformation can unfortunately travel rapidly. \"Even a small decline in vaccine uptake can have devastating consequences.\" In the US, an outbreak in Texas and New Mexico, which led to the country's first measles deaths in a decade, has seen 28 more infections this week, taking the total to 256. It is the first major challenge for new health secretary and long-time vaccine sceptic Robert F Kennedy Jr."

        "Content": "\n          Political editor\n              @BethRigby\n  When Sir Keir Starmer landed in Hull on Thursday as the latest prime minister proposing to reshape the state, he wanted to show he meant it, announcing he was abolishing the world's largest quango - NHS England (and with it 9,000 jobs). Significant, decisive and designed to make the point - the prime minister grabbed attention for the argument that he wanted to make around tackling an \"ever-expanding\" state that was, in his words, \"weaker\" than it has ever been, and failing to serve the public properly. This is his diagnosis and his remedy, reform: dispensing of regulators, cutting red tape, injecting artificial intelligence in the backbone of the state to improve efficiency and cut costs (and jobs). Politics latest: Thousands to lose jobs as PM abolishes NHS England On most of this he was vague - heavy on rhetoric but light on detail, but the symbolism of abolishing NHS England was clear for all to see: this prime minister is borrowing from a Conservative playbook in an effort to improve services through deregulation, public service cuts and a bonfire of red tape.  Sir James Bethell, a Conservative peer and former health minister, retweeted the prime minister's announcement on scrapping NHS England with the words: \"I wish we'd had the guts to do this.\" Sir Keir is also signalling he's prepared to have a fight - not just with the \"blockers\" or the \"NIMBYs\", but with his own party, public sector workers and the unions as he takes a scalpel to the state. \n                  Ministers 'determined to fix broken benefits system' - as welfare cuts expected\n                 \n                  New planning bill could be the government's most important - but will it work in practice?\n                 \n                  Mike Amesbury to quit as MP after punching man in street - triggering by-election\n                 Reforms are ultimately about winning a second term The prime minister said every arm's-length governmental body was up for review - and also, in a couple of weeks, he will take aim at the burgeoning welfare budget in an effort to find billions in savings as he looks to deal with the squeeze on the public finances through spending cuts rather than tax rises or loosening his chancellor's self-imposed borrowing rules. Taking on the state in one form or the other is something many a Conservative prime minister, not least Liz Truss, have often talked about, and now Sir Keir is adopting this approach. But for him, the ultimate pragmatist, this is not about ideology but something else - delivery, and ultimately, trying to win a second term.  This is him explaining his motivations to his cabinet in a letter he sent to all his ministers last month: \"Politics is no longer built around a traditional left-right axis. It is instead being reimagined around a disruptor - disrupted axis. If governments are not changing the system in favour of working people, then voters will find someone else who does. \"We need to be disruptors - on behalf of those ordinary, working people who just want more security in their lives and a country that is on its way back up again. \"That means taking on vested interests of all kinds, it means challenging laws that hold Britain back, stripping back regulation that stifles progress, moving power out of Westminster and back to communities across the country. It means standing up for ordinary people who feel shut out and ignored by elites. Whenever we see barriers to renewal, this government will tear them down.\" At its heart is the admission from the prime minister that if his government doesn't deliver, the winners will be Reform UK, or even a revived Conservative opposition. Starmer prepared to fight for his public sector reforms But as much as he makes this argument, there will be many in his party, in the union movement, and who voted Labour who hear the word austerity when they hear Sir Keir say \"reform\". That's why I asked him, at the event in Hull, whether this drive was a return to austerity, or, at the very least, will appear that to those on the receiving end of these cuts. Read more:What is NHS England - and what does abolishing it mean?MPs vote to scrap key part of assisted dying billStarmer says welfare bill is 'indefensible' After all, at the general election manifesto launch, when I asked the prime minister whether there would be a return to austerity under a Labour government, he vowed: \"There will not be austerity under a Starmer government.\" On Thursday, he insisted there would be \"no return to austerity\".  \"Part of the problem we've got with our public services is what was done to them a decade or so ago. So we're not going down that route, and none of our plans are going down that route,\" he said. But when those welfare cuts are announced later this month, Sir Keir's \"reforms\" might look rather different, as might his plans for public sector reform if thousands of workers lose their jobs. What was clear as he made his argument on Thursday is that it's a fight he's prepared to have."

An investigation into corporate manslaughter was launched in October 2023 following the trial and conviction of ex-nurse Letby. But Cheshire Constabulary have now widened their probe to determine whether gross negligence manslaughter took place. While corporate manslaughter covers cases where a corporation's negligence leads to a person's death, gross negligence manslaughter is when an individual's negligence causes death. In a statement, Detective Superintendent Paul Hughes said: \"This is a separate offence to corporate manslaughter and focuses on the grossly negligent action or inaction of individuals. \"It is important to note that this does not impact on the convictions of Lucy Letby for multiple offences of murder and attempted murder.\" Det Supt Hughes added: \"Those identified as suspects have been notified. We will not be confirming the number of people involved or their identity as no arrests or charges have yet been made. \"Both the corporate manslaughter and gross negligence manslaughter elements of the investigation are continuing and there are no set timescales for these. \"Our investigation into the deaths and non-fatal collapses of babies at the neo-natal units of both the Countess of Chester Hospital and the Liverpool Women's Hospital between the period of 2012 to 2016 is also ongoing. \"Our priority is to maintain the integrity of our ongoing investigations and to support the many families who are at the heart of these.\" Letby, 35, from Hereford, is serving 15 whole-life orders after she was convicted across two trials at Manchester Crown Court of killing seven babies, and attempting to murder seven others - making two attempts on one of her victims - between June 2015 and June 2016.  Last month an international panel of neonatologists and paediatric specialists said bad medical care and natural causes were the reasons for the collapses and deaths. Their evidence has been passed to the Criminal Cases Review Commission (CCRC), which investigates potential miscarriages of justice, and Letby's legal team hope her case will be referred back to the Court of Appeal. A public inquiry into the events surrounding Letby's crimes will reconvene at Liverpool Town Hall on 17 March for closing submissions, and the findings of Lady Justice Thirlwall are expected this autumn. A spokesperson at the Countess of Chester Hospital NHS Foundation Trust said: \"Due to the Thirlwall Inquiry and the ongoing police investigations, it would not be appropriate to comment further at this time.\""

        "Content": " A teenager who stabbed a 15-year-old girl to death in a row over a teddy bear cried in the dock as he was jailed for at least 23 years. Hassan Sentamu, 18, had a history of attacking girls and carrying knives before he killed Elianne Andam near the Whitgift Centre in central Croydon in September 2023. Elianne had stood up for his ex-girlfriend, who was her friend. Following Sentamu's sentencing at the Old Bailey today, the girl's father, Michael Andam, told the court how the \"thought of her final moments torments me\". He added that he wondered if she was \"hoping I would save her\" before telling the court: \"I couldn't protect her. \"That guilt will weigh on my heart for the rest of my life.\" Elianne was repeatedly stabbed in what police described as a \"frenzied\" attack that was caught on CCTV. Sentamu, who was 17 at the time, was arrested less than 90 minutes later after getting off a bus. The boy, of Rowdown Crescent, New Addington, admitted manslaughter but denied murder on the basis of \"loss of control\" because he has autism. He was found guilty of murder and possession of a knife in January following a trial at the Old Bailey. Sentamu had recently broken up with a friend of Elianne's, whom he had agreed to meet up with to return items, including a teddy bear, that they exchanged while they were going out together, the court heard. But he instead came armed with a knife, wearing two pairs of gloves and a facemask. When the ex-girlfriend, who cannot be named for legal reasons, asked for her belongings, she says he refused to hand them over and replied: \"I don't want to hurt you.\" The girl says she then started asking him for her teddy bear before Elianne ran up behind him and grabbed a bag of items that had been returned to him. She added that Elianne then started \"running and laughing as a joke\" before Sentamu chased her and stabbed her multiple times. The day before the killing, he had seen the girls at the Whitgift Centre where they \"teased\" him and his ex-girlfriend threw water on him. Seething at the perceived disrespect, he told a friend he could not \"let this slide\". Read more:Sentamu says he would 'do it again', court hearsElianne Andam posted video on Snapchat before fatal stabbing  In a televised sentencing, Mrs Justice Cheema-Grubb said Elianne, an aspiring lawyer, was a \"hard-working, happy girl\" with a \"radiant smile\". She told the defendant: \"Elianne was 15 when you murdered her, she will always remain just 15, she will never realise the potential of her life.\" His actions were due to his \"short temper and aggressive tendencies\" which combined with his \"deliberate decision to carry a knife,\" the judge said. Sentamu sat with head in his hands in the dock and wiped away tears as he was sentenced to life in prison and told he must serve at least 23 years. Elianne's family criticised the sentence outside court, saying it had left them feeling \"abandoned and unheard\". Mark Rossell, a pastor, said on behalf of the family: \"We cannot accept such lenient sentences are appropriate for violent calculated crimes like this.\" 'The music has stopped' Earlier the family described their \"living nightmare\" in a series of statements read to the court. Her mother Dorcas Andam said: \"Elianne was my world, she was the kindest most loving daughter I could have asked for. She was vibrant, creative and purposeful. \"She loved deeply, loved to sing, braided hair, and always practised new styles. Our home was full of her music, laughter and energy. There was always warmth and joy when Elianne was there. \"Now the music has stopped, the laughter has gon, and all that is left is a deafening silence that echoes through my life.\" Addressing Sentamu, Mrs Andam added: \"You brutally murdered her in the most humiliating way in broad daylight. \"Mercilessly killing her on the floor as she begged for mercy. You walked away showing no remorse as if her life meant nothing. \"You did not only kill Elianne, you killed me mentally and emotionally. Your actions were senseless and evil.\" Father speaks of torment Meanwhile, Elianne's father told the court: \"I close my eyes and see the horror of what she must have endured - the fear, the pain - and it breaks me over and over again. \"No parents should ever have to bury their child, let alone in such a violent and cruel manner. The thought of her final moments torments me - wondering if she was calling out for me, hoping I would save her - but I wasn't there. I couldn't protect her. \"That guilt will weigh on my heart for the rest of my life.\" Elianne's cousin Denzil Larbi told the defendant: \"What you did was the most monstrous and evil act that is imaginable. You will forever remain a villain in our story.\" Met Police Detective Chief Inspector Becky Woodsford, who led the investigation, said after sentencing: \"Today marks the end of a very long journey for Elianne's family and friends, and while this is the best outcome they could have hoped for, nothing will ease the immeasurable pain they continue to live with on a daily basis. \"Since Elianne was taken from them in the most incomprehensible way, they have been driven by a motivation to see her killer brought to justice. Getting to this point has been challenging for them, and I would like to pay testament to their continued dignity, determination and composure.\""

        "Headline": "Three female veterans have shared their stories with Sky News, detailing claims of rape and sexual assault that took place in the military. ",
        "Content": "By Becky Johnson, social affairs correspondent, Rebecca Spencer, specialist producer   Warning: This article contains material some readers may find distressing  Jane* served in the British Army for almost 20 years. It was a career she loved and excelled in, rising through the ranks. But then, she says, it ended when a colleague raped her. She breaks down as she recalls the night out, almost six years ago. Jane reported the attack to the Royal Military Police but days later was called into a meeting with officers in her chain of command and accused of flirting with men and drinking too much. Later, she discovered messages they had exchanged calling her a whore. The military police investigated, but the case never made it to court martial, where military trials are heard - she was told there was an unrealistic chance of conviction. Her case formed part of a legal process to try to force the previous government to transfer rape investigations in the armed forces to civilian courts, but the change was voted down in parliament. Now, a high-profile former defence minister, and veteran, who failed to back the move has admitted he got it wrong. Johnny Mercer has told Sky News that he, and other members of the previous government, must accept their part in the \"colossal failure of leadership across all ranks\" to deal with sexual abuse in the army. Three female veterans have shared their stories with Sky News. A toxic culture where abuse is rife When 19-year-old soldier Jaysley Beck took her own life in December 2021, hundreds of servicewomen shared their experiences on social media, describing a toxic culture where sexual abuse is not only rife but tolerated. The inquest into Gunner Beck's death last month found she had been sexually assaulted and then failed by the army when she reported it. This prompted the change of heart from Johnny Mercer. \"I should have argued harder for serious and sexual offences to be taken away from the MoD to civilian police,\" he told Sky News. He has now called on the current government to act, saying \"now is the time to make that change\". Hayley* was a new recruit when she reported witnessing a female colleague being sexually assaulted by a senior officer. She said at first \"he didn't say anything\". Then \"he dragged me by the back of my coat, up the stairs to the office. I knew I couldn't keep up, and I remember falling over my knees, like dragging on the floor\". She continued: \"He stood over me with his finger right in my face, screaming and swearing - like he was screaming so much he was spitting - and he was saying 'don't you dare speak about that ever again'. \"I remember thinking there's girls who are at risk here, anything can happen to them and nobody cares.\" Months later, she was woken up by a male colleague climbing into her bed. \"He was trying to kiss my face and touch me,\" she said, her voice trembling. \"I was moving my head and saying: 'you need to go'.\" She reported it to the Royal Military Police. \"I remember them being so condescending.\" They asked her if she had been drinking, if she had locked her door and if she had encouraged him. \"It did eventually get dropped because there wasn't enough evidence against him.\" 'I was left with bruising on my neck' Michelle, who left the army in 2020 after 11 years that included active service in Afghanistan, said sexual harassment went on \"all the time\". \"I've had my breasts grabbed by people...Guys when I've walked upstairs have looked up my skirt to see if I'm wearing underwear,\" she said. \"Disgusting stuff like that\". Jane said her attacker was someone she knew. \"He was trying to kiss me, and I was pushing him away. He grabbed at my throat and was pushing me down on to this blow-up bed. And then he was trying to put his penis in my mouth,\" she said. \"I had bruising to both my arms and also on my neck. \"It was the worst experience I've ever been through. I loved my career and never wanted to leave my job. I nearly lost everything, including my mental health. I wanted to end it all.\" The Royal Military Police investigated but the case did not go to court martial because, Jane was told, there was an unrealistic possibility of conviction. Call to remove sexual offences from military court Campaigners have been urging politicians for years to remove sexual offence cases from the military justice system. \"The conviction rate for cases that get to court martial for rapes and serious sexual assault is far lower than the equivalent figures in the Crown Court,\" said Emma Norton, a lawyer who established the Centre for Military Justice. \"That, on the face of it, is a serious difference that is completely unjustifiable.\" Email: sky.today@sky.uk or WhatsApp 07583 000 853 In opposition, Labour backed the proposal to transfer serious and sexual offences out of military courts. Sky News asked the Ministry of Defence (MoD) if it intends to make the legal change but it did not reply to the question. A spokesperson for the MoD said: \"There is no place for bullying, harassment or discrimination in the military. This government is totally committed to making the reforms that are needed to stamp out inappropriate behaviour and hold people to account.\" Their experiences have left many women conflicted about their time in the army. \"I had some of the best and also worst times of my life... that's hard to reconcile,\" said Hayley. \"I don't want to look back and feel sorry for myself, but I feel the younger version of myself was severely let down by the people who were in authority at the time. \"It's not acceptable for this to be happening.\" *Names have been changed Anyone feeling emotionally distressed or suicidal can call Samaritans for help on 116 123 or email jo@samaritans.org in the UK.

        "Content": "The father and stepmother of Sara Sharif will not have their sentences for the 10-year-old's murder reduced, appeal judges have ruled. In December last year, Urfan Sharif was sentenced to life in prison with a minimum term of at least 40 years in prison and Beinash Batool a minimum of 33 years. Sara's uncle, Faisal Malik, was also sentenced to a minimum of 16 years after being found guilty of causing or allowing the death of a child. All three brought bids to challenge their sentences at the Court of Appeal, while the Solicitor General asked judges to increase Sharif's sentence under the unduly lenient sentencing scheme. However, the judges rejected the appeal to have their sentences reduced. They also ruled that Sharif's sentence was not unduly lenient. Lady Chief Justice Baroness Carr - sitting with Mr Justice Soole and Mr Justice Goose - declined to alter their sentences. She said: \"We can see no arguable basis to challenge the conclusion of the trial judge. \"None of the sentences imposed in this case can properly be described as manifestly excessive. \"We are not persuaded that anything less than a whole life order was unduly lenient. \"The judge who heard the lengthy trial was right to describe Sara's death as the culmination of years of neglect, frequent assaults and torture.\" Baroness Carr added that the court should give \"great weight\" to Mr Justice Cavanagh's assessment, as he was \"in the very best position to make the assessment that he did.\" Sara was found dead in a bunk bed at the family home in Woking, Surrey, in August 2023. She had suffered 71 recent injuries at the time of her death, including 25 broken bones, iron burns on her bottom, scalding marks to her feet, and human bites, appeal judges were told. They also heard that Sara was made to stand against a wall with her arms up, forced to do sit-ups and was occasionally woken up in the middle of the night so her father, Sharif, could \"impose physical punishment on her\". Sara, aged \"six or seven\", was also made to do the washing and tidying at home, the court heard. Baroness Carr said: \"Neither Sharif, nor Batool, had any concern for Sara's happiness or her quality of life. Read more on Sky News:Thousands to lose jobs as PM abolishes NHS EnglandPutin holding news conference with ally LukashenkoIsrael accused of 'genocidal acts', UN report \"She was treated as if she was worthless. No allowances were made for her age.\" The court also heard that Sara had been \"deprived of an education\", as she was taken out of school on two occasions in June 2022 and April 2023, when her bruises became visible. She subsequently wore a hijab and had makeup put on her by her stepmother to hide her injuries, appeal judges were told. Sharif, 42, Batool, 30, and Malik, 29, fled to Pakistan with the rest of their family after Sara was killed. The three adults, along with five children, were captured on CCTV at Heathrow Airport, where they boarded a flight to Islamabad the day after Sara's death. They were arrested as they returned to Gatwick Airport on 13 September, 2023."

The 72-year-old was drugged and raped by her ex-husband, who also invited dozens of strangers to abuse her for almost a decade. The contents of the private letter have not been disclosed. But a Palace aide said the Queen, who has long campaigned against domestic and sexual violence, praised her \"extraordinary dignity and courage\". The aide told Newsweek magazine: \"[The Queen] was tremendously affected by the Madame Pelicot case in France and that lady's extraordinary dignity and courage as she put herself in the public eye because, as she rightly put it, why should she be made to feel like a victim or hide away in shame? \"And, of course, she helped highlight a very significant societal problem despite all the personal suffering she'd been through. \"So, as a long-term supporter of survivors of domestic and sexual abuse, the Queen wrote to Madame Pelicot privately. \"It was very much her instigation and determination to write to express support from the highest level.\" Ms Pelicot's ex-husband, Dominique Pelicot, had confessed to the charges against him and was sentenced to 20 years in prison after a historic mass trial last year. He also admitted to mixing sedatives into Ms Pelicot's food and drink so he could sexually assault her. He was one of 51 men who were on trial for participating in attacks against Ms Pelicot. All of the men were found guilty of at least one offence, with nearly all convicted of rape, after a trial which shocked France and made headlines around the world.

        "Content": "\n          News reporter\n       The moon will turn red in the night sky tonight in an event known as a blood moon. The phenomenon only happens a handful of times a year, and this is your next chance to spot one in the UK. A blood moon is a full lunar eclipse, occurring when the Earth passes between the moon and the sun. From the UK, only a partial lunar eclipse will be visible, meaning only part of the moon will appear red. But when is it, what exactly will you see, and what causes it? Here's everything you need to know. When is the blood moon? Those who want to see it will have to get out of bed early tomorrow morning. That's because the eclipse will start to be visible at 3.57am, becoming particularly noticeable at 5.09am, according to the Royal Observatory Greenwich. It says the maximum of the eclipse in London will be at 6.19am. The full lunar eclipse will be at 6.58am UK time. But that will only be visible to people in North and South America, because in the UK the moon will already have set below the horizon. What will you see? At 3.57am, the moon will move into the Earth's penumbra - the lighter part of its shadow - making parts of it appear dark, explains Imo Bell, astronomy education assistant at the Observatory. Then at 5.09am, the part of the moon in shadow will turn reddish as the moon moves into the darker part of Earth's shadow, known as the umbra. How can I see it clearly? The phenomenon will be clear with the naked eye, weather permitting. Sky News' weather producer Jo Robinson says: \"At the end of the night, England and Wales will be mostly overcast, with some fog likely in the clearer south-east. \"For Scotland, skies will turn clearer from the north through the night, but southern parts may well remain cloudy. \"Meanwhile, Ireland and Northern Ireland can expect good clear spells. It'll be chilly for anyone heading outside to look, with a frost in places. There'll be a few showers around too, some wintry.\" You can give yourself the best possible chance of a good shot by getting a clear view of the western horizon from 5.09am, Bell says. This will allow you to see the Earth's shadow gradually cover the moon while it moves towards the horizon, before it sets after 6.19am. \"Wales, Northern Ireland, Cornwall and western parts of Scotland will be favourable because you want to delay the moon sinking below the horizon for as long as possible, so the more west, the better,\" adds Bell, who describes their first blood moon experience, in 2008, as \"magical\". \"My dad used mugs to explain how the sun, Earth, and moon would form a perfect line and then let us stay up way past bedtime to head out into the cold to watch the moon turn red,\" Bell says. What causes a blood moon? It is caused by the Earth passing between the moon and the sun, known as a lunar eclipse. During a total lunar eclipse, the Earth completely stops sunlight from directly hitting the moon as the sun and the Earth perfectly align with it. Only light that is refracted through Earth's atmosphere manages to reach the moon, with everything outside of the red wavelengths being scattered, leaving the moon looking blood red. \"This is due to the scattering of bluer hues in the sun's light through our atmosphere, leaving only oranges and reds to reach the moon - the same reason we get reddish sunrises and sunsets,\" Bell explains. The UK is only catching a partial lunar eclipse, because the moon will only be visible while the sun, Earth and moon are almost aligned, rather than fully. Read more:What we know about the asteroid that could hit EarthMusk in social media row with respected astronaut How often is there a lunar eclipse - and when is the next one? Because of the way the moon orbits the Earth, and because the Earth orbits the sun, there are always between two and five a year visible from somewhere on our planet, according to the Observatory. This might make you wonder why there are not lunar eclipses every month as the moon orbits Earth. It's because the moon's path is tilted compared to Earth's orbit around the sun, moving up and down as it goes. This means it doesn't always get in Earth's shadow. There will be an opportunity to see a total lunar eclipse in the UK on 7 September - though the view is expected to be challenging due to how low the moon will be on the horizon. There will be more information on that nearer the time. In the meantime, we hope you get a good view tomorrow."

        "Content": "A woman from Canterbury has been convicted of murdering her husband and hiding his body in their garden. Jeremy Rickards, 65, was found dead behind the family property on St Martin's Road in Canterbury on 11 July 2024. Crime scene investigation analysis suggests his body had been stored in a cupboard in their flat - before being moved to the garden. His wife, Maureen Rickards, had told their daughter that Mr Rickards had travelled to Saudi Arabia for work. Their daughter, however, was concerned by the style of the written messages and asked her mother if she had taken over her father's phone. Rickards claimed that Mr Rickards died by suicide in Saudi Arabia - but police had no record of him leaving the country. Kent Police subsequently launched a search operation after Mr Rickards was reported missing by his step-daughter on 5 July. Rickards was arrested six days later - after police searched the family home. Mr Rickards was found with a catalogue of injuries, including five stab wounds to his chest, non-fatal injuries sustained about 10 days before his death, and other injuries thought to have been inflicted weeks earlier. Senior investigating officer Detective Inspector Colin McKeen said that Rickards's violence towards her husband was not a \"one-off incident\". Read more on Sky News:Thousands to lose jobs as PM abolishes NHS EnglandDonald Trump says he thinks US will annex GreenlandQueen Camilla sent private letter to rape survivor Gisele Pelicot He said: \"This was a horrific murder of a man who we believe had been a supportive husband to his wife, despite her violence towards him. \"Sadly, our investigation suggests that, rather than being a one-off incident, Maureen Rickards had attacked her husband on a number of occasions before this fatal assault. \"She has never expressed any remorse for what she did and has repeatedly sought to frustrate the investigation and push blame onto others, including the victim himself. \"The jury has seen through her lies and she will now spend many years in prison.\" Based on a pathologist's findings and Mr Rickards's last known sighting, police believe Rickards killed her husband on or around 9 June. Gardeners had visited their family home on 26 June last year - and Rickards had asked them to leave the grass they had cut under some bushes. This was where Mr Rickards's body was later discovered. James Fisher, from the Crown Prosecution Service South East, said: \"As we built the case against Maureen Rickards, we were able to unpick her web of lies, using forensic evidence and her actions before and after the murder, to paint the picture of a callous abuser, who subjected Jeremy to unimaginable pain and suffering. \"The attacks on Jeremy became more severe in the run-up to his murder, leaving him frail, battered and bruised, with everyone who came into contact with him concerned for his wellbeing. \"Maureen lied about the cruelty and violence she inflicted on Jeremy and was quick to dismiss any concerns, even claiming the injuries had come from a car accident.\" Rickards will be sentenced next month."

        "Content": "\n          Wales reporter\n              @TomosGruffydd\n Plans to build the UK's longest ski slope in the Welsh Valleys have been approved by councillors. At a meeting of Merthyr Tydfil Council's planning committee on Wednesday, members decided to back the £300m project, despite a report which recommended its rejection. The indoor snow centre, measuring up to 39,200 sq m in area, is set to include a ski slope between 400m and 424m long. Currently, the longest indoor real snow ski slope in the UK is Chill Factore in Manchester, which is 180m long, and most of the handful of other UK indoor slopes are between 150m and 170m. The Merthyr site is also expected to feature a tropical waterpark, indoor activity centre and outdoor activity area and provide hotel accommodation, with up to 418 bedrooms and up to 30 woodland lodges. A petition calling for the plans to be approved has been signed by more than 2,800 people. Marvel Limited, the company behind the proposals, noted in its application that the Rhydycar West development would have a \"highly significant positive impact\" on the local economy. \n                  Talbot Green: Sixth arrest as part of fatal shooting investigation\n                 \n                  Cornwall: Men found guilty of £100m cocaine fishing boat plot\n                 \n                  Call for smartphone ban in Welsh schools rejected by Senedd committee\n                 An estimated 842 jobs are set to be created once the site is operational, with an annual contribution to the local economy of £38.1m forecast. But a report in front of the council's planning committee recommended the plans be refused. In its conclusions, the report found \"the potential economic and social benefits... would not outweigh the harm identified to the important ecological and landscape value of the site\". At the meeting, members voted against the report's recommendation and instead voted to support the proposal. Ali Tyebkhan, Rhydycar West's chief executive, said the decision was a \"huge step forward\" for the development. \"As the UK's national centre of excellence for snowsport, Rhydycar West will be the home and training HQ of the Welsh and GB National, Paralympic and Olympic teams, while boosting local businesses, the town centre, and cultural attractions,\" he added.

The plans will now be referred to Welsh government ministers for further consideration."

        "Content": "\n          News reporter\n              @samuelosborne93\n  Vladimir Putin has said Russia agrees to an end to fighting in Ukraine, but \"lots of questions\" remain over proposals for a 30-day ceasefire. Casting doubt over whether a deal can be agreed, the Russian president said a ceasefire must lead to \"long-term peace\" which \"would remove the initial reasons for the crisis\". Russia has previously said it would not accept Ukraine joining NATO and European peacekeepers in Ukraine. Moscow has reportedly also presented a \"list of demands\" to the US to end the war, which would include international recognition of Russia's claim to Crimea and four Ukrainian provinces. Ukraine's president Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Mr Putin's remarks were \"very predictable\" and \"very manipulative\", adding that the Russian president was preparing to reject the ceasefire proposal he agreed with the US. Mr Putin's comments came as Donald Trump's envoy Steve Witkoff arrived in Moscow ahead of talks over Ukraine with the Russian president. Ukraine war latest updates Speaking on Thursday afternoon, Mr Putin described the situation in Russia's Kursk region, where Ukrainian troops have pushed into Moscow's territory, as \"completely under our control\". It appeared the US had persuaded Ukraine to accept the ceasefire, he said, but Ukraine is also interested because of the battlefield situation, with its forces in Kursk fully blocked in the coming days. \"In these conditions, I believe it would be good for the Ukrainian side to secure a ceasefire for at least 30 days,\" he said. He also said there would need to be a mechanism to control possible breaches of the truce. Another issue he raised was whether Ukraine could use the 30-day ceasefire to continue to mobilise and rearm. He said he would need to speak to Mr Trump over the terms of any ceasefire. Moscow correspondent Vladimir Putin was never going to flat out reject the US proposal for a ceasefire, but he also wasn't going to fully endorse it either. Russia’s agreement, as expected, comes with several strings attached. The Kremlin leader didn't specify Moscow’s demands but he did allude to them by saying that any peace deal had to eliminate the \"root causes\" of the conflict. It's become a frequent refrain of his, and shows that Moscow's maximalist position hasn't changed. By \"root causes\", the Russian president is referring to NATO's eastward expansion, which he blames as the catalyst for the war in Ukraine. It's a very clear indication his agreement to a ceasefire relies on getting some kind of security guarantees of his own, for example a promise Ukraine will never join NATO, or that there'll never be any European peacekeeping forces from NATO members based in the country in the future. He also articulated why Moscow is reluctant to agree to an immediate truce, talking at length about his forces' advances in Kursk region. Ukraine's incursion there has been humiliating for the Kremlin, but their expulsion is finally within reach. Mr Putin doesn't want that opportunity to slip away. By pausing Russia's offensive, he fears they'll lose the advantage and give the enemy time to regroup. Mr Putin was, however, careful to thank Donald Trump for his efforts in trying to reach a peace agreement, perhaps wary of any backlash from the White House. But despite that, he still doesn't appear to be showing any sign of compromise. Mr Putin was speaking alongside Belarus's President Alexander Lukashenko and the pair said in a joint statement that NATO's actions regarding the war in Ukraine were fraught with the risk of nuclear conflict. The two countries also criticised the European Union's policy towards Russia, labelling it aggressive and confrontational.  Russia's invasion of Ukraine in early 2022 has left thousands of people dead and injured, millions displaced and towns and cities reduced to rubble. Moscow's forces have been advancing since the middle of last year and now control nearly a fifth of Ukraine's territory. In his speech Mr Putin said Russian forces were pushing forwards along the entire frontline. Responding to the comments, Mr Zelenskyy said: \"Putin, of course, is afraid to say directly to President Trump that he wants to continue this war, he wants to kill Ukrainians.\" He said Mr Putin's words were \"just another Russian manipulation\". Mr Trump also responded to the remarks, saying Mr Putin's statement was not complete and reiterated his willingness to talk to the Russian president, adding: \"Hopefully Russia will do the right thing.\" In a news conference with NATO secretary general Mark Rutte, the US president shifted his tone on the alliance, saying it was \"stepping up\" and praising Mr Rutte for doing \"some really good work\". Mr Rutte said NATO members needed to produce more weapons, stating the alliance was not doing enough and was lagging behind Russia and China.  It comes after Mr Putin donned a camouflage uniform to visit a command post in the Kursk region on Wednesday."

It alleges a broad range of violations perpetrated against Palestinian women, men, girls and boys since 7 October 2023 - which Israel has denied and rejected. \"Israeli authorities have destroyed in part the reproductive capacity of the Palestinians in Gaza as a group,\" said the report by the UN Independent International Commission of Inquiry on the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem, and Israel.

In addition, a surge in maternity deaths due to restricted access to medical supplies amounted to the crime against humanity of extermination, it said.

        "Content": "\n          Science and technology editor\n              @t0mclark3\n Technically, the hundred-mile-long, 20 mile-wide British overseas territory of South Georgia is uninhabited. Only a few visiting scientists and government fisheries inspectors occupy the island all year round. But from a wildlife perspective, it's anything but. Its shores are home to the largest number of marine birds and mammals on the planet. The impact of the world's biggest iceberg Lying 800 miles east off the Falkland Islands and a thousand miles north of Antarctica, it's one of the few fragments of land between that vast frozen continent and the rest of the world.  The part of the South Atlantic in which it sits is one of the most food-rich oceans in the world, fed by powerful circulating currents, and it's full of shrimp-like Antarctic krill. \"Krill feeds the blue whales, humpback whales, fin whales. It also feeds the gentoo penguins, macaroni penguins, chinstrap penguins and the fur seals,\" says Martin Collins, a scientist with the British Antarctic Survey, and former head of the South Georgia government, speaking to me from his office at King Edward Point on the island. The island also has some of the largest and most significant populations of elephant seals, king penguins and several species of albatross and petrel - the hardiest of ocean-going seabirds. The island has been in the headlines after the world's largest iceberg, A23a, ran aground off its south-west coast.  Concern over impact of iceberg on island's wildlife There's a concern it could impact wildlife on the island - but the timing is fortuitous, says Mr Collins. \"It's the end of the breeding season now, which means the impacts on penguins at that part of the island will be lessened. \"There may be a little bit of impact, particularly on gentoo penguins, which still forage around the island during the winter.\" From a wider conservation point of view, South Georgia is one of the world's stand-out success stories. Until the 1960s, it was a major hub for whaling. Thousands of whales were caught off its coasts and processed at a number of whaling stations - the scale of the slaughter such that the bays around the island were red with whale blood. The whalers introduced reindeer for food that nibbled and trampled unique plant life that sustained many of the island's endemic wildlife. Stowaway rats plundered the eggs and chicks of penguins and other ground nesting birds (there are no trees).  Whales returning in large numbers The South Georgia pipit, the world's most southerly songbird, was driven to the brink of extinction. But before the abandoned whaling stations have even rusted away, whales have begun returning to South Georgia in large numbers. A campaign of air-dropping poisoned bait across the inaccessible island has eradicated the rats and the pipits are booming. The seas around South Georgia were once heavily fished. The worst for wildlife were long-line vessels trying to hook high-value Chilean seabass. Call for outright ban on fishing Albatross and petrels would dive for the bait and be caught and drowned. Since 2012, the government of South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands have policed a 500,000 square-mile marine-protected area around the islands where most fishing is now banned. A few vessels are licensed to catch shrimp-like krill and seabass but only in winter when most predators are absent and under strict controls. Some conservationists are calling for fishing to be banned outright. However, the South Georgia government argues it's the income from limited fishing licences that allows them to protect and monitor the exclusion zone. Crucial at a time when funding from central government is scarce and unlikely to increase. The key threat now is the rapidly changing climate around South Georgia. \"There's evidence that the distribution of krill is moving a little further south gradually over time,\" says Mr Collins. \"We need to be really mindful of that changing climate.\" But he's optimistic too. Despite warmer oceans, numbers of some species are booming. Especially whales and fur seals. \"I've just had two king penguins walking past the windows as we were talking,\" he says. \"When I first came here in the late 1990s, there were no fur seals in this area at all. And now they're everywhere around us\"."

        "Content": "\n          Science correspondent\n              @SkyNewsThomas\n  Scientists are genetically modifying mosquitoes in the hope of stopping the spread of malaria. The technique, which uses genes taken from the honeybee and the African clawed frog, blocks normal growth of the malaria parasite inside the mosquito. It would mean a mosquito bite in regions of the world where the disease is endemic no longer carried a potential death sentence. The World Health Organisation says there were almost 600,000 deaths from malaria in 2023, three quarters of them in children under five. Dr Nikolai Windbichler, a geneticist at Imperial College London, said the GM mosquitoes could work where other attempts at malaria control have failed. \"The advantage is that nobody needs to do anything,\" he said. \"For example, with a bed net you need to impregnate it with insecticide and put it up when you go to sleep. It requires people to do something to be effective. \n                  Over half of world's population could be at risk of mosquito-borne diseases, experts warn\n                 \n                  What 2023 has taught us about... science and technology \n                 \n                  Cheap malaria vaccine developed with help of Oxford scientists approved for global rollout\n                 \"But this technology is purely genetic, so no one will have to actually do anything for it to be beneficial.\" Sky News was allowed into the insectary at Imperial College, where thousands of mosquitoes are being bred as part of the groundbreaking Transmission Zero project. Step one in the process of creating the GM mosquito is injecting the insect egg with genes from other species that make proteins that are toxic to the malaria parasite. They slow the normal development of the parasite inside the stomach of the mosquito. When the female insect bites someone to draw blood - which she needs to make eggs - the parasite is too immature to infect them and cause disease. In a second crucial step, researchers use another genetic technique to ensure all the offspring of the GM mosquitoes carry the same anti-malaria trait. Dr Windbichler said the technique meant only a relatively small number of modified mosquitoes would need to be released into the wild for the whole population to effectively become malaria resistant. \"The trait is self-propagating,\" he said. \"Over time it will get more and more common in the population. \"It will also spread geographically so that eventually every malaria transmitting mosquito in Africa could carry this.\" The research is being done in collaboration with scientists in Tanzania and is funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. There are now two vaccines against malaria, but they are expensive and only moderately effective. Drugs are also available, but the parasite is developing resistance to some of them. The genetic technique, on the other hand, is relatively cheap. After the initial lab work, the GM mosquitoes effectively do all the work. Read more:Half the world could be at risk of mosquito-borne diseasesWhy some people really are 'mosquito magnets' Professor George Christophides, an infectious diseases specialist at Imperial College, said it's likely to be many years before the GM mosquitoes would be released into the wild. \"We have to prove in the lab that it works, and it works in the way we want it to work,\" he said. \"And then we have to prove that it is safe and that it doesn't cause any unintentional harm, both to people and the environment. \"It has to be accepted by local communities and the regulators before we test them in the field.\""

The country's interior minister Tony Burke said on Thursday his department is reviewing the conditions of the American's visa - and whether she had breached immigration law. Footage she posted showed her picking up the baby wombat - a protected species of marsupial found only in Australia. It could be seen struggling and heard hissing as its mother followed on the road behind. Jones later placed the wombat back on the road.

Australia's foreign minister Penny Wong said the video was distressing. \"It looked pretty dreadful, didn't it?\" she said in an interview with Channel Seven. \"Really, leave the wombat alone.\" It is currently unclear if the wombat was reunited with its mother, or where the social media video was filmed. The common wombat is typically found in eastern Victoria, Tasmania and eastern New South Wales (NSW). Wombats are endangered in NSW and so are protected by law in the state, where it is an offence to harm them without a licence."

Two doses of the measles vaccine are believed to be 97% effective in preventing the disease, which typically affects the respiratory system and leads to symptoms such as fever, cough, runny nose and a rash. Measles is one of the most contagious viruses for humans. In serious cases, infections can cause complications including pneumonia, encephalitis, dehydration and blindness. \n                  Unvaccinated child dies from measles in first US death from virus since 2015\n                 \n                  Measles: Mum urges parents to vaccinate children after baby left 'struggling to breathe'\n                 \n                  Measles cases worldwide almost double in a year - as England faces measles 'emergency'\n                 More than half of the European region cases had to be treated in hospital, and 38 people died. 'Measles is back' WHO's Europe director Dr Hans Kluge said: \"Measles is back, and it's a wake-up call.\" He added: \"Without high vaccination rates, there is no health security... The measles virus never rests - and neither can we.\" The nation with the most infections last year was Romania which had 30,692, followed by Kazakhstan with 28,147.

In Montenegro, fewer than 50% of children have been vaccinated against measles for at least the past five years. In Bosnia and Herzegovina, the figure was less than 70%. UK officials said last month there have been more than 200 reported cases in the country and that many more were expected. Vaccination rates not back to pre-pandemic levels Measles cases in the region have generally been declining since 1997, when 216,000 were reported, reaching a low of 4,440 cases in 2016, according to the WHO and UNICEF. However, a resurgence was seen in 2018 and 2019 with 89,000 and 106,000 cases reported for those years respectively. After a drop in immunisation coverage during the COVID pandemic, cases rose significantly again in 2023 and 2024. Vaccination rates in many countries are yet to return to pre-pandemic levels, increasing the risk of outbreaks.

A rash usually appears a few days after the cold-like symptoms. The rash starts on the face and behind the ears before spreading to the rest of the body.\n\n A person is infectious from when they first have symptoms (around four days before the rash appears) until four days after they get the rash. There are things people can do to reduce the risk of spreading or catching measles. Do:\nWash hands often with soap and warm water.\nUse tissues when coughing or sneezing.\nThrow used tissues in the bin. Don't:\nDo not share cutlery, cups, towels, clothes, or bedding. Information from NHS website 'Never too late to be vaccinated' Concerns about the safety of the measles vaccine have lingered for decades, after British physician Dr Andrew Wakefield and colleagues published a paper in 1998 - which has long since been retracted - linking the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine to autism. No evidence for any causal link has ever been found and Wakefield had his licence to practise medicine in the UK revoked. \"It's never too late to get vaccinated,\" said Dr Ben Kasstan-Dabush, from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, who warned that misinformation can unfortunately travel rapidly. \"Even a small decline in vaccine uptake can have devastating consequences.\" In the US, an outbreak in Texas and New Mexico, which led to the country's first measles deaths in a decade, has seen 28 more infections this week, taking the total to 256. It is the first major challenge for new health secretary and long-time vaccine sceptic Robert F Kennedy Jr."

The 72-year-old was drugged and raped by her ex-husband, who also invited dozens of strangers to abuse her for almost a decade. The contents of the private letter have not been disclosed. But a Palace aide said the Queen, who has long campaigned against domestic and sexual violence, praised her \"extraordinary dignity and courage\". The aide told Newsweek magazine: \"[The Queen] was tremendously affected by the Madame Pelicot case in France and that lady's extraordinary dignity and courage as she put herself in the public eye because, as she rightly put it, why should she be made to feel like a victim or hide away in shame? \"And, of course, she helped highlight a very significant societal problem despite all the personal suffering she'd been through. \"So, as a long-term supporter of survivors of domestic and sexual abuse, the Queen wrote to Madame Pelicot privately. \"It was very much her instigation and determination to write to express support from the highest level.\" Ms Pelicot's ex-husband, Dominique Pelicot, had confessed to the charges against him and was sentenced to 20 years in prison after a historic mass trial last year. He also admitted to mixing sedatives into Ms Pelicot's food and drink so he could sexually assault her. He was one of 51 men who were on trial for participating in attacks against Ms Pelicot. All of the men were found guilty of at least one offence, with nearly all convicted of rape, after a trial which shocked France and made headlines around the world. They were sentenced to a total of more than 400 combined years.

Officers have also arrested a second man who is accused of trying to silence the woman when she resisted the alleged rape and molesting her. The woman, from London, is said to have met up with the alleged rapist, named in India as Kailash, after making friends with him online a few months ago. The alleged victim was on holiday in the western state of Goa when the 24-year-old suspect, from Vasundhara in east Delhi, is said to have told her he was unable to travel and invited her to meet him. The woman is then reported to have travelled around 1,200 miles to Delhi and checked into a hotel in the village of Mahipalpur on Tuesday night before arranging to meet with Kailash. The rape suspect is said to have arrived with his friend Wasim before the three of them had dinner. They are then reported to have headed to her hotel room. Kailash is then accused of raping her while Wasim is alleged to have tried to silence her when she resisted. Wasim is also accused of molesting the woman. The alleged victim has told police Kailash struggled to speak in English and used Google Translate to communicate with her. Both of the men have since been taken from a police station in Vasant Kunj, New Delhi, to appear before a magistrate. Police in Delhi have said: \"A man was arrested on charges of rape with a British woman in a Mahipalpur hotel in Delhi. His accomplice was arrested on charges of molestation.\" A UK Foreign Office spokesperson said: \"We are supporting a British woman in India and are in touch with the local authorities.\" It comes after an Israeli and Indian woman were allegedly raped in the town of Koppal in the southwest Indian state of Karnataka. The women and three male friends, an American and two Indians, were stargazing when three men on a motorbike approached them and asked for money, according to police. An altercation took place before the men who were on the bike are said to have pushed the male tourists into a canal. The three attackers are then accused of raping the two women. Meanwhile, one of the Indian men in the canal drowned while the other two managed to swim to safety. Police have arrested two suspects in connection with the alleged gang rape.

The real numbers could be far higher due to the stigma surrounding sexual violence and victims' lack of faith in police. Rape and sexual violence have been under the spotlight in India since the 2012 gang-rape and brutal murder of a 23-year-old student in Delhi. The crime shocked the nation and mass protests took place across the country against the dangers women face. The protests forced the government to enact new laws, change old ones and make the punishment for rape more severe. Special courts have been established to try such cases in a timely period. Meanwhile, the age at which people could be tried for rape as an adult was lowered from 18 to 16. In 2018, the Indian government approved the death penalty for people convicted of raping children under 12."

        "Content": " Jewish protesters have stormed Trump Tower in the city of New York, demanding the release of a pro-Palestinian activist arrested by immigration officials. At least 150 people poured into the building's lobby in midtown Manhattan to demonstrate against the detention of Mahmoud Khalil, who led Columbia University protests in 2024 against Israel's war in Gaza. The group from Jewish Voice for Peace carried banners, wore red shirts reading \"Jews say stop arming Israel\" and chanted \"Bring Mahmoud home now!\" Local police said 98 were arrested on charges including trespassing, obstruction and resisting arrest. Donald Trump previously described Mr Khalil, 30, who has lawful permanent resident status in the US, as \"anti-American\". He is married to an American citizen. The postgraduate student, from Columbia University's school of international and public affairs, has been a prominent figure in the university's pro-Palestinian student protest movement. This week, his deportation was put on hold while his lawyers challenged his detention at an immigration detention centre in Louisiana.

US secretary of state Marco Rubio has claimed he has reasonable grounds to believe Mr Khalil's activities or presence in the country could have \"serious adverse foreign policy consequences\".  On Thursday, Mr Khalil's lawyers asked a federal judge to release him from immigration detention. They argued that President Trump's administration targeted him for deportation because of his activism, and his detention is a violation of the US Constitution's First Amendment protections for freedom of speech. US correspondent There's more to this story than the story itself. In Donald Trump's USA, the proceedings against Mahmoud Khalil are an American tolerance test. At the heart of it is the US Constitution itself and the First Amendment that enshrines the right to free speech. Mahmoud Khalil is the measure of where it starts and where it ends - the fate of others will turn on his test case. As President Trump put it, his arrest is the first of \"many to come\", citing students who had \"engaged in pro-terrorist, antisemitic, anti-American activity\". Read more from James here. Separately, his lawyers asked the court to block Columbia University from sharing student disciplinary records from campus protests with a Republican-led US House of Representatives committee. Mr Khalil's case has become a flashpoint for Mr Trump's pledge to deport some activists who participated in the wave of protests on US college campuses against Israel's military assault on Gaza following the October 2023 attack by the militant group Hamas.

The US president used a social media post to issue his latest threat to the EU, having previously warned that it was created to \"screw the United States\" and would \"very soon\" face his escalating trade war. He wrote in a Truth Social post: \"The European Union, one of the most hostile and abusive taxing and tariffing authorities in the world, which was formed for the sole purpose of taking advantage of the United States, has just put a nasty 50% tariff on whisky.

REPRESENTED COUNTRIES. \"This will be great for the wine and champagne businesses in the US,\" he concluded. It was Mr Trump's response to a European Commission pledge to reimpose previously suspended tariffs on the US in response to US steel and aluminium duties which came into force on Wednesday. The commission said its retaliatory measures would target US goods worth €26bn from 1 April unless talks could resolve the trade war escalation. Mr Trump is widely expected, from 2 April, to carry out a previous threat that would see all EU exports to the United States come under tariffs - mirroring current plans to target his closest neighbours Mexico and Canada. Financial markets were quick to react to the latest escalation, with EU stock markets sinking across the board.  The declines were led by drinks manufacturers. Pernod Ricard on the CAC in Paris, for example, was more than 3.5% lower in the moments after Mr Trump's post was published. The FTSE 100 was also in negative territory. Diageo, which counts Irish-made favourite Guinness among its stable of brands, was only 0.1% down.

It was understood that before the threat was made, Spain, France and Italy had been among nations urging the EU not to target wine and spirits as part of its response to the metals duties. The Irish Whiskey Association said of the growing protectionism: \"There is no winner in a trade war. The imposition of tariffs will impact on our businesses and our consumers. \"Having our sector implicated in this dispute puts jobs, investments and businesses at risk and has the potential to be devastating for Irish Whiskey.\""

The authors write: \"By attempting to gag US companies and prohibit them from answering questions from Congress, the UK is both violating the free speech rights of US companies and impairing Congress's power and duty to conduct oversight on matters of national security. \"The first amendment to the US Constitution guarantees Americans, including US companies, 'the right to petition the government for redress of grievances'. \"This rule extends to communications with Congress and responses to Congressional oversight requests for information.\" 👉 Listen to Sky News Daily on your podcast app 👈 The letter says Apple and Google have both told Congress that if they had received a TCN, they would not be able to discuss it. It goes on to state that, due to the \"significant technical complexity of this issue\" and the national security importance of encryption, \"it is imperative that the UK's technical demands of Apple - and of any other US companies - be subjected to robust, public analysis and debate by cybersecurity experts\". The Ministry of Justice, of which the Investigatory Powers Tribunal is part, declined to comment."

In Donald Trump's USA, the proceedings against Mahmoud Khalil are an American tolerance test. At the heart of it is the US Constitution itself and the First Amendment that enshrines the right to free speech. Mahmoud Khalil is the measure of where it starts and where it ends - the fate of others will turn on his test case. As President Trump put it, his arrest is the first of \"many to come\", citing students who had \"engaged in pro-terrorist, antisemitic, anti-American activity\". Khalil, born in Syria to Palestinian refugees, arrived in the US on a student visa. The 30-year-old holds a green card and is a permanent resident of the United States.  Khalil's role during protests He became prominent during pro-Palestinian demonstrations at New York's Columbia University last year, acting as a mediator between protesters and university officials. Currently, he is in a detention centre in Louisiana, having been arrested by immigration officers outside his Manhattan apartment last week. The legal reason given is \"potentially serious adverse foreign policy consequences\" for the United States. What has the White House said? White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt has claimed Khalil \"organised group protests that not only disrupted college campus classes and harassed Jewish American students and made them feel unsafe on their own college campus, but also distributed pro-Hamas propaganda, fliers with the logo of Hamas\". Khalil's legal team insist there's no evidence to support the White House claims and say the government is targeting him merely for holding a view contrary to theirs.

        "Content": "\n          News reporter\n        The Menendez brothers, who were convicted of killing their parents in their Beverly Hills mansion in 1989, will soon find out if they can be released from prison. Lyle Menendez, 56, and his 53-year-old brother Erik are serving life in prison without parole for the shotgun murders of their father and mother - Jose and Kitty Menendez. The brothers have maintained their parents abused them since they were first charged with the murders. A Netflix drama series about the brothers called Monsters, which aired in September, thrust them back into the spotlight and led to renewed calls for their release - including from their family. The brothers' lawyers asked Los Angeles prosecutors to review their sentencing, potentially paving the way for their release. A decision was expected in a resentencing hearing scheduled for 11 December last year, but it has been pushed back a number of times. But what is the case for the brothers' freedom, is there new evidence - and why has the decision been delayed? \n                  Mahmoud Khalil: Nearly 100 arrested in New York after Trump Tower protest in support of pro-Palestinian activist\n                 \n                  Donald Trump says he thinks US will annex Greenland\n                 \n                  Trump threatens EU with 200% tariffs on alcohol - including wine and champagne\n                 An old defence with new evidence The Menendez brothers, who were 21 and 18 at the time their parents died, admitted shooting them before they were found guilty of first-degree murder and conspiracy to murder in 1996. But they claim they killed them in self-defence after enduring physical, emotional and sexual abuse over many years, including being molested by their father. Prosecutors at the time contended there was no evidence of any sexual abuse. They said the brothers were after their parents' multimillion-dollar estate. The jury in their first trial in 1993 was deadlocked before the jury in their second trial found them guilty, rejecting a death sentence in favour of life without parole. But their lawyers argue that because of society's changing views on sexual abuse, the brothers may not have been convicted of first-degree murder and sentenced to life without parole today. They say they should have been charged with manslaughter rather than murder, but this was not an option for the jury during the second trial. The brothers' defence team has also uncovered a letter that Erik Menendez wrote to his cousin which is dated months before the murders, which they say alludes to him being abused by his father. Read more:Kim Kardashian visits Lyle and Erik Menendez in jailNetflix series star 'stands with' Menendez brothersMonsters creator reacts after family label drama 'grotesque' LA district attorney (DA) George Gascon briefly shared the letter to his Instagram page before deleting the post. In the handwritten letter, Erik wrote: \"I've been trying to avoid dad... every night, I stay up thinking he might come in.\" He also said he was \"afraid\" and that he needed to \"put it out of my mind\" and \"stop thinking about it\". Roy Rossello, a former member of the band Menudo, also spoke out in the Peacock documentary series Menendez + Menudo: Boys Betrayed, alleging he was sexually assaulted by Jose Menendez as a teenager in the 1980s. The band was signed under RCA Record at the time, where Jose Menendez was chief operating officer, and Mr Rossello claims he drugged and raped him. How can they be freed? Former LA district attorney George Gascon asked LA County Superior Court Judge Michael Jesic to review their convictions before he left the role in December. He recommended giving them a revised sentence of 50 years to life, which would make them immediately eligible for youth parole because they were less than 26 years old when they killed their parents. The judge has been asked to look at whether the pair have been rehabilitated, based on their behaviour in prison. A document filed by the lawyers highlights some of their achievements while behind bars, including both attaining several degrees and contributing to the community. It lists a prison \"beautification programme\" Lyle Menendez started called GreenSpace as one example, and adds that both brothers have received low-risk assessment scores, with Lyle apparently not being involved in a single fight during his time in jail. The lawyers have also submitted the letter Erik wrote to his cousin as new evidence, saying it was not seen by the jury when the brothers were sentenced in 1996 and could have influenced their decision. Roy Rossello has also provided a signed declaration of his alleged rape by Jose Menendez to the brothers' lawyers, which they say is further proof of his supposed abusive nature. In a news conference, Mr Gascon clarified that the review was not to determine whether or not the brothers killed their parents, saying it was \"factual\" and \"well established\" they had. He also said more than 300 people had been resentenced during his term as district attorney and only four had gone on to reoffend. Why has the hearing been delayed? Judge Jesic said it was partially because he needed time to review 17 boxes of documents relating to the case and was \"not ready to go forward\". But it's also because the DA who recommended the review, Mr Gascon, has been replaced by Nathan Hochman, who took office on 2 December. The judge said the delay was also to give Mr Hochman enough time to review and weigh in on the case. The new DA, a Republican-turned-independent, has differing views to his predecessor Mr Gascon, a Democrat known for his particularly progressive views. The trial was set for the end of January, but it was pushed back again to March due to the California wildfires. Big changes since resentencing trial was set LA's previous DA Gascon called for the resentencing because he believed the brothers had been rehabilitated in prison, and felt their trial would have been treated differently with today's understanding of how sexual and physical abuse affects children. This gave the Menendez brothers hope, because when prosecutors support resentencing, there is \"somewhat of a presumption\" that the court will do it, says Laurie Levenson, a former federal prosecutor and professor of criminal law at Loyola Law School in Los Angeles. But his successor, Mr Hochman, disagrees, saying earlier this month the brothers have repeatedly lied about why they killed their parents and \"fell short\" of taking full responsibility for their crimes. He has opposed the resentencing, saying it's because of their \"lack of full insight and lack of complete responsibility for their murders\". His office has submitted an 88-page document urging the judge to withdraw the previous DA's resentencing motion. It does not mean the resentencing is getting called off, but experts like Ms Levenson say it significantly reduces the likelihood of the judge ruling in the brothers' favour. Another potential road to freedom In addition to a resentencing, the brothers have also sought their freedom through a request for clemency from California governor Gavin Newsom, who has the power to free them himself. Mr Newsom, who supported Mr Gascon, ruled out making a decision until he has heard Mr Hochman's views on the brothers' case. \"The governor respects the role of the district attorney in ensuring justice is served and recognises that voters have entrusted District Attorney-elect Hochman to carry out this responsibility,\" Mr Newsom's office said in a statement on 25 November. \"The governor will defer to the DA-elect's review and analysis of the Menendez case prior to making any clemency decisions.\" But even after Mr Hochman's decision to push against the brothers' freedom, their hopes of Mr Newsome granting clemency have not disappeared. At the end of February, the governor ordered the state parole board to investigate whether the brothers would pose a risk to the public. It was a move celebrated by the Menendez's lawyers, who said in a statement: \"The family realises that the governor's action does not mean he will commute the sentences. Instead, this initial step reflects the governor's considered decision to at least obtain the information required to make a fair decision as to whether Erik and Lyle, after 35 years in prison, have done the hard work necessary to have a chance at a life outside prison.\" Mr Newsom said he wants the parole board to finish the risk assessment within 90 days. Following the assessment, there will be a hearing allowing victims' family members and prosecutors to participate in the process, according to the governor's office. Ms Levenson has suggested that because of the change at the DA's office, clemency is now the brothers' best shot at freedom. What the Menendez family says Some of the brothers' extended relatives attended the hearing on 25 November where a resentencing date was originally set. Two of their aunts testified, making what a lawyer for the siblings described during a brief news conference as \"impassioned pleas\" for Erik and Lyle to be sent home. Erik's stepdaughter said their family remains united in their effort to bring the siblings home. While the judge's delay was not \"the outcome we had hoped for,\" she said in a statement, \"we remain optimistic that it represents a step forward in securing their freedom\". The brothers themselves were scheduled to make their first court appearance in years, but the remote feed from the San Diego prison where they are incarcerated was hampered by technical issues. On 17 October, two dozen extended family members gathered for a news conference in Los Angeles. Jose Menendez's niece Anamaria Baralt spoke on their behalf, telling reporters: \"Both sides of the family are united, sharing a new bond of hope. \"This is about truth, justice and healing... Their continued incarceration serves no rehabilitative purpose.\" Ms Baralt said the brothers were victims of a \"culture that was not ready to listen\", as she called on the district attorney's office to \"take into account the full picture\". Joan Andersen VanderMolen, Kitty Menendez's sister, also told reporters: \"I had no idea the extent of the abuse they suffered at the hands of my brother-in-law. None of us did. \"We know that abuse has long effects, and victims of trauma sometimes act in ways that are very difficult to understand.\" Family not entirely united Kitty Menendez's brother, Milton Andersen, 90, has said \"the appropriate sentence\" for the pair was life in prison without parole. His lawyer said: \"He believes that there was no molestation that occurred. He believes that the motive was pure greed, because they had just learned that they were going to be taken out of the will.\""

The US president used a social media post to issue his latest threat to the EU, having previously warned that it was created to \"screw the United States\" and would \"very soon\" face his escalating trade war. He wrote in a Truth Social post: \"The European Union, one of the most hostile and abusive taxing and tariffing authorities in the world, which was formed for the sole purpose of taking advantage of the United States, has just put a nasty 50% tariff on whisky. Money latest: Tesco introduces £0 yellow stickers for groceries after 9.30pm \"If this tariff is not removed immediately, the US will shortly place a 200% Tariff on all WINES, CHAMPAGNES, & ALCOHOLIC PRODUCTS COMING OUT OF FRANCE AND OTHER E.U. REPRESENTED COUNTRIES. \"This will be great for the wine and champagne businesses in the US,\" he concluded. It was Mr Trump's response to a European Commission pledge to reimpose previously suspended tariffs on the US in response to US steel and aluminium duties which came into force on Wednesday. The commission said its retaliatory measures would target US goods worth €26bn from 1 April unless talks could resolve the trade war escalation. Mr Trump is widely expected, from 2 April, to carry out a previous threat that would see all EU exports to the United States come under tariffs - mirroring current plans to target his closest neighbours Mexico and Canada. Financial markets were quick to react to the latest escalation, with EU stock markets sinking across the board.  The declines were led by drinks manufacturers. Pernod Ricard on the CAC in Paris, for example, was more than 3.5% lower in the moments after Mr Trump's post was published. The FTSE 100 was also in negative territory. Diageo, which counts Irish-made favourite Guinness among its stable of brands, was only 0.1% down. Read more:What are Trump's tariffs and how will they affect the UK?The man Canada is sending to battle Trump While the UK has not been threatened directly with tariffs beyond the universal steel and aluminium duties, many of its constituent companies would be hurt by an expanding EU-US trade spat. United Nations data shows that EU nations export alcoholic drinks worth more than $11bn per year to the United States, with wine accounting for half that sum. It was understood that before the threat was made, Spain, France and Italy had been among nations urging the EU not to target wine and spirits as part of its response to the metals duties. The Irish Whiskey Association said of the growing protectionism: \"There is no winner in a trade war. The imposition of tariffs will impact on our businesses and our consumers. \"Having our sector implicated in this dispute puts jobs, investments and businesses at risk and has the potential to be devastating for Irish Whiskey.\""

        "Content": "More retired baby boomers are paying income tax than Gen Z workers, new data from HMRC shows. It is a significant shift since the pre-COVID period. Some 5.45 million Britons aged over 70 paid income tax in the 2022-23 financial year (the latest figures we have), compared with 5.23 million aged under 30. (Generation Z covers those born between 1995 and 2012.) Over-70s paid £19.1bn in income tax, compared with £18.3bn by under-30s, as Britain becomes increasingly reliant on its retirees. Baby boomers have seen their tax bills rise, as many with even modest private pensions have been dragged into the income tax net because of the triple lock. That guarantees the state pension rises in line with average earnings, inflation, or 2.5% - whichever is highest. In addition, the thresholds at which people start paying income tax have been frozen since 2021 - rather than going up in line with inflation. With this freeze due to last until 2028, the amount of income tax being paid across all age groups is only set to rise. The HMRC data dump also revealed the number of higher rate taxpayers (40p) increased by 680,000 to 5.1 million people in 2022-23 - another consequence of frozen thresholds. The number of top rate (45p) taxpayers rose by 10% to 600,000.

        "Content": "\n          Wales reporter\n              @TomosGruffydd\n Plans to build the UK's longest ski slope in the Welsh Valleys have been approved by councillors. At a meeting of Merthyr Tydfil Council's planning committee on Wednesday, members decided to back the £300m project, despite a report which recommended its rejection. The indoor snow centre, measuring up to 39,200 sq m in area, is set to include a ski slope between 400m and 424m long. Currently, the longest indoor real snow ski slope in the UK is Chill Factore in Manchester, which is 180m long, and most of the handful of other UK indoor slopes are between 150m and 170m. The Merthyr site is also expected to feature a tropical waterpark, indoor activity centre and outdoor activity area and provide hotel accommodation, with up to 418 bedrooms and up to 30 woodland lodges. A petition calling for the plans to be approved has been signed by more than 2,800 people. Marvel Limited, the company behind the proposals, noted in its application that the Rhydycar West development would have a \"highly significant positive impact\" on the local economy. \n                  Talbot Green: Sixth arrest as part of fatal shooting investigation\n                 \n                  Cornwall: Men found guilty of £100m cocaine fishing boat plot\n                 \n                  Call for smartphone ban in Welsh schools rejected by Senedd committee\n                 An estimated 842 jobs are set to be created once the site is operational, with an annual contribution to the local economy of £38.1m forecast. But a report in front of the council's planning committee recommended the plans be refused. In its conclusions, the report found \"the potential economic and social benefits... would not outweigh the harm identified to the important ecological and landscape value of the site\". At the meeting, members voted against the report's recommendation and instead voted to support the proposal. Ali Tyebkhan, Rhydycar West's chief executive, said the decision was a \"huge step forward\" for the development. \"As the UK's national centre of excellence for snowsport, Rhydycar West will be the home and training HQ of the Welsh and GB National, Paralympic and Olympic teams, while boosting local businesses, the town centre, and cultural attractions,\" he added.

Sky News has learnt that Royal London is now the leading contender to acquire Dalmore, which has roughly £6bn in assets under management. The structure of the proposed deal means its valuation is not fixed, but is expected to involve Royal London paying approximately £130m, according to infrastructure executives. Money latest: Tesco introduces £0 yellow stickers for groceries after 9.30pm Dalmore owns stakes in Thames Tideway's 25km super sewer, which is expected to be fully operational next year; Porterbrook, a leading owner of rolling stock for Britain's railways; and Cory, the waste-to-energy giant. In January, it acquired the remaining assets of Triple Point Energy Transition, an investment trust that was in wind-down mode. It is also a backer of IEP West, a rolling stock contract with the government to maintain dozens of Hitachi Intercity Express Trains and three depots for the Great Western Main Line. If Royal London concludes a deal with Dalmore, it would reflect a growing push by traditional asset managers into so-called alternative assets, including infrastructure. BlackRock, the world's biggest fund manager, recently swooped to buy Global Infrastructure Partners, the former owner of London's Gatwick Airport. RLAM, Royal London's asset management arm, manages more than £170bn of clients' money. A person close to Dalmore said previously that a combination of normalising asset prices and the new government's signalling of plans to increase infrastructure investment would create an attractive macroeconomic backdrop for the firm.

The welfare cuts are expected to include £5bn in savings by making it harder to qualify for Personal Independent Payments (PIP), which help people with the additional costs of their disability. PIP payments next year are also expected to be frozen and the basic rate for Universal Credit paid to those searching for work, or in work, is expected to be increased while the rate for those judged as unfit for work will be cut. The department for work and pensions said new figures show 1.8 million people are now considered too sick to look for work due to a \"broken work capability assessment\" so are on Universal Credit but getting no support to find work.

        "Content": " Sir Keir Starmer has confirmed plans to abolish the \"arm's-length body\" NHS England. But what is the quango - and why is the prime minister scrapping it? What is NHS England and how does it work? NHS England was established in 2013 by former Conservative health secretary Andrew Lansley to give the NHS greater independence and autonomy - with an intention for it to operate at arm's length from the government. It was set up as a quango - an organisation that is funded by taxpayers, but not controlled directly by central government - and is responsible for delivering high-quality care, supporting staff, and ensuring value for money. Politics latest: Follow live updates  Its website states that it has a \"wide range of statutory functions, responsibilities and regulatory powers\", which include working with the government to agree funding and priorities for the NHS and overseeing the delivery of safe and effective NHS services. NHS England currently employs about 15,300 people, while the Department for Health and Social care (DHSC) - the ministerial department responsible for developing and implementing policies and legislation on health and social care in England - employs 3,300.  Health Secretary Wes Streeting said on Thursday the government wants to slash those totals by 50% to \"deliver hundreds of millions of pounds worth of savings\". But when questioned precisely how many jobs would be lost, the prime minister's official spokesperson said he was \"not going to get into figures at this stage\". As health is a devolved matter, the equivalent bodies for Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland cannot be abolished by the prime minister. Why has it been scrapped? The prime minister has said abolishing the body will bring management of the NHS \"back into democratic control\". He said the move would free up money for doctors, nurses and frontline services, and cut red tape to help speed up improvements in the health service, amid frustrations about the pace of change. Sir Keir added the NHS will \"refocus\" on cutting waiting times at \"your hospital\". When asked how the decision would improve NHS services, Sir Keir said on Thursday: \"Amongst the reasons we are abolishing it is because of the duplication. \"So, if you can believe it, we've got a communications team in NHS England, we've got a communications team in the health department of government; we've got a strategy team in NHS England, a strategy team in the government department. We are duplicating things that could be done once.\" He said that stripping out duplication allows the government to \"free up that money to put it where it needs to be, which is the front line\". Mr Streeting added: \"When money is so tight, we can't justify such a complex bureaucracy with two organisations doing the same jobs. \"We need more doers, and fewer checkers, which is why I'm devolving resources and responsibilities to the NHS frontline.\" What will happen now? NHS England will be brought back into the DHSC. It is expected to take two years for the quango to be brought fully into the DHSC and will aim to generate £100m in savings, Mr Streeting said. The implementation of artificial intelligence and digitalisations will work to free up £45bn of savings, the prime minister's spokesperson said. A new leadership team has also been brought in to help oversee the transition. It comes after NHS England said three leading board members were stepping down at the end of the month. Chief financial officer Julian Kelly, chief operating officer Emily Lawson and national medical director Sir Stephen Powis will leave their roles in the coming weeks. At the time, NHS chief executive Amanda Pritchard - who is also stepping down - said the board members made their decision based on the upcoming changes to the size and function of the centre. Sir James Mackey, who will be taking over as transition chief executive of NHS England, said while he knows the announcement will \"unsettle staff\" it will also bring \"welcome clarity\" as the NHS focuses on \"tackling the significant challenges ahead\". Incoming NHS chair, Dr Penny Dash, added she will be working to \"bring together NHSE and DHSC to reduce duplication and streamline functions\". Read more on Sky News:Ex-soldier reported being raped by a colleague - but was labelled a flirtWhat will be the impact of world's biggest iceberg? 'Devastating for staff' The prime minister's announcement has been met with mixed reaction. Thea Stein, head of the Nuffield Trust - a charitable trust which aims to improve health care in the UK - said the announcement will be \"devastating for staff at all levels of NHS England\". She added it \"makes sense to remove the duplication and bureaucracy that exists currently\" but warned: \"We must remain mindful of the human cost of this decision.\"  Thinktank The Health Foundation added it was a \"watershed moment\" in how the NHS is governed and managed, and there is \"logic\" in the decision to bring the NHS and government closer together. However, it added that scrapping NHS England will \"cause disruption and divert time and energy of senior leaders at a time when attention should be focused on improving care for patients\". The thinktank said: \"Reforming NHS bureaucracy is not the same as reforming patient care - and government must be careful that these changes don't get in the way.\" What happened during the last NHS shake up? Under the Conservative-Liberal Democrat coalition government in 2012 the Health and Social Care Act was implemented. This worked to significantly reform the NHS by establishing clinical commissioning groups, abolishing primary care trusts and strategic health authorities, and creating Public Health England. The move has been criticised by the current government, who said it created \"burdensome\" layers of bureaucracy without any clear lines of accountability. Mr Streeting claimed the \"disastrous\" reorganisation \"led to the longest waiting times, lowest patient satisfaction, and most expensive NHS in history\"."

        "Content": "\n          Political editor\n              @BethRigby\n  When Sir Keir Starmer landed in Hull on Thursday as the latest prime minister proposing to reshape the state, he wanted to show he meant it, announcing he was abolishing the world's largest quango - NHS England (and with it 9,000 jobs). Significant, decisive and designed to make the point - the prime minister grabbed attention for the argument that he wanted to make around tackling an \"ever-expanding\" state that was, in his words, \"weaker\" than it has ever been, and failing to serve the public properly. This is his diagnosis and his remedy, reform: dispensing of regulators, cutting red tape, injecting artificial intelligence in the backbone of the state to improve efficiency and cut costs (and jobs). Politics latest: Thousands to lose jobs as PM abolishes NHS England On most of this he was vague - heavy on rhetoric but light on detail, but the symbolism of abolishing NHS England was clear for all to see: this prime minister is borrowing from a Conservative playbook in an effort to improve services through deregulation, public service cuts and a bonfire of red tape.  Sir James Bethell, a Conservative peer and former health minister, retweeted the prime minister's announcement on scrapping NHS England with the words: \"I wish we'd had the guts to do this.\" Sir Keir is also signalling he's prepared to have a fight - not just with the \"blockers\" or the \"NIMBYs\", but with his own party, public sector workers and the unions as he takes a scalpel to the state. \n                  Ministers 'determined to fix broken benefits system' - as welfare cuts expected\n                 \n                  New planning bill could be the government's most important - but will it work in practice?\n                 \n                  Mike Amesbury to quit as MP after punching man in street - triggering by-election\n                 Reforms are ultimately about winning a second term The prime minister said every arm's-length governmental body was up for review - and also, in a couple of weeks, he will take aim at the burgeoning welfare budget in an effort to find billions in savings as he looks to deal with the squeeze on the public finances through spending cuts rather than tax rises or loosening his chancellor's self-imposed borrowing rules. Taking on the state in one form or the other is something many a Conservative prime minister, not least Liz Truss, have often talked about, and now Sir Keir is adopting this approach. But for him, the ultimate pragmatist, this is not about ideology but something else - delivery, and ultimately, trying to win a second term.  This is him explaining his motivations to his cabinet in a letter he sent to all his ministers last month: \"Politics is no longer built around a traditional left-right axis. It is instead being reimagined around a disruptor - disrupted axis. If governments are not changing the system in favour of working people, then voters will find someone else who does. \"We need to be disruptors - on behalf of those ordinary, working people who just want more security in their lives and a country that is on its way back up again. \"That means taking on vested interests of all kinds, it means challenging laws that hold Britain back, stripping back regulation that stifles progress, moving power out of Westminster and back to communities across the country. It means standing up for ordinary people who feel shut out and ignored by elites. Whenever we see barriers to renewal, this government will tear them down.\" At its heart is the admission from the prime minister that if his government doesn't deliver, the winners will be Reform UK, or even a revived Conservative opposition. Starmer prepared to fight for his public sector reforms But as much as he makes this argument, there will be many in his party, in the union movement, and who voted Labour who hear the word austerity when they hear Sir Keir say \"reform\". That's why I asked him, at the event in Hull, whether this drive was a return to austerity, or, at the very least, will appear that to those on the receiving end of these cuts. Read more:What is NHS England - and what does abolishing it mean?MPs vote to scrap key part of assisted dying billStarmer says welfare bill is 'indefensible' After all, at the general election manifesto launch, when I asked the prime minister whether there would be a return to austerity under a Labour government, he vowed: \"There will not be austerity under a Starmer government.\" On Thursday, he insisted there would be \"no return to austerity\".  \"Part of the problem we've got with our public services is what was done to them a decade or so ago. So we're not going down that route, and none of our plans are going down that route,\" he said. But when those welfare cuts are announced later this month, Sir Keir's \"reforms\" might look rather different, as might his plans for public sector reform if thousands of workers lose their jobs. What was clear as he made his argument on Thursday is that it's a fight he's prepared to have."

Before Labour won last summer's election, Mr Streeting said he had \"absolutely no intention of wasting time with a big costly reorganisation\" of the NHS. However, hours after Sir Keir Starmer dropped the bombshell that NHS England, the administrative body that runs the national health service, will be abolished to slash red tape, the health secretary said his mind had been changed. Politics latest: Mood in NHS England 'very low today' He told Trevor Phillips on Sky News' Politics Hub: \"I didn't anticipate coming in wanting to make this change to NHS England. It wasn't on my list of priorities. \"I recognise that in order to achieve the change I want, this is a necessary step.\" He said his instincts were to not scrap the quango \"unless it was necessary\". \"I've concluded that it is necessary because you can't have a situation where you've got two head offices duplicating work, a man marking each other, sometimes working against each other,\" he added.  9,000 plus will lose jobs Mr Streeting also confirmed thousands of people will lose their jobs, answering \"yes\" when asked if the move means more than 9,000 civil servants will be out the door - around half of the 19,000 people the health secretary said work for NHS England and the Department of Health and Social Care. He acknowledged it \"will be an anxious time for them...there's no way of sugarcoating\" it. \"But we will be treating people with care and respect and the fairness that they are owned through this process,\" he said. He said the Conservatives inherited the \"shortest waiting times and the highest patient satisfaction in history\" when they won the 2010 election, but said they \"turned it on its head\". He claimed the Labour government \"is fixing it\" but added: \"We do have to put a foot down on the accelerator.\" The health secretary reiterated his previous comments that it would \"be daft not to use spare capacity in the private sector\" to alleviate pressure on the NHS.

I want to end that two-tier system.\" Sir Keir said axing NHS England will bring management of the NHS \"back into democratic control\" as it returns to the Department of Health and Social Care 12 years after the Conservatives created it. The prime minister said the result would end the duplication from two organisations doing the same job, freeing up staff to focus on patients and putting more resources on the frontline.

        "Content": "\n          Political reporter\n              @alixculbertson\n The Work and Pensions Secretary has said the government is \"determined to fix the broken benefits system\" ahead of announcing \"radical welfare reforms\" next week. Liz Kendall said the current system has locked \"millions\" out of work and called it \"dysfunctional\" as the system places a person in binary categories of either \"fit for work\" or \"not fit for work\". The government has promised to either reform or replace the Work Capability Assessment - which determines if a person is fit for work or not - as they say it currently drives people who want to work \"to a life on benefits\". Politics latest: Thousands to lose jobs as PM abolishes NHS England Ms Kendall said: \"Millions of people have been locked out of work by a failing welfare system which abandons people - when we know there are at least 200,000 people who want to work, and are crying out for the right support and a fair chance. \"This government is determined to fix the broken benefits system we inherited so it genuinely supports people, unlocks work, boosts living standards while putting the welfare bill on a more sustainable footing.\" Ministers have been priming MPs and the public for cuts to a ballooning welfare bill since the start of the year, with details expected next week ahead of an announcement at Chancellor Rachel Reeves's spring statement on 26 March. \n                  Labour MPs criticise impending benefit cuts - as all 404 MPs summoned to Downing Street briefing\n                 \n                  Welfare cut plans are nothing new - but government will have to fight its own backbenchers\n                 \n                  Minister Pat McFadden says welfare cuts are 'coming soon'\n                  The expected welfare cuts Ms Reeves is expected to announce several billion pounds of spending cuts after losing her £9.9bn headroom since the October budget, with the welfare budget a key target for cuts. The welfare cuts are expected to include £5bn in savings by making it harder to qualify for Personal Independent Payments (PIP), which help people with the additional costs of their disability. PIP payments next year are also expected to be frozen and the basic rate for Universal Credit paid to those searching for work, or in work, is expected to be increased while the rate for those judged as unfit for work will be cut. The department for work and pensions said new figures show 1.8 million people are now considered too sick to look for work due to a \"broken work capability assessment\" so are on Universal Credit but getting no support to find work. It said the number has almost quadrupled since the start of the pandemic when 360,000 were considered too sick to look for work. Read more:What welfare cuts could be announced?Labour MPs criticise benefit cuts  Labour MPs concerned about cuts A growing number of Labour MPs are publicly raising concerns and, in an unusual move, all 404 Labour MPs were asked to attend \"welfare roundtables\" in Downing Street with the Number 10 policy unit on Wednesday and Thursday. On Wednesday, Sir Keir Starmer faced down Labour MPs unhappy over the rumoured welfare cuts - especially for disabled people. Richard Burgon pleaded with him to make the \"moral\" choice, telling the Commons disabled people are \"frightened\" as he urged the PM to introduce a wealth tax instead of \"making the poor and vulnerable pay\". Sir Keir pledged to \"protect those who need protecting\", but later added there is no \"bottomless pit\". He said the Tories \"left a broken welfare system, which locks millions out of work, that is indefensible in my view, economically and morally\". Another Labour MP, John Slinger, urged the PM to reassure the Commons he will \"provide compassion to those who can't work\". Labour MP Nadia Whittome told the BBC the government should impose a wealth tax instead of \"placing that burden on disabled people who have already borne the brunt of 14 years of austerity\". She added that she \"can't look her mum in the eye and support this\"."

        "Content": " Measles cases in Europe and Central Asia doubled last year compared to 2023, the World Health Organisation (WHO) and UNICEF have warned in what is being called a \"wake-up call\". There were 127,350 reported infections in the region in 2024, which is the highest number since 1997. It is around a third of last year's total worldwide cases of 359,521. More than 40% of the European cases were children under five, as the two global bodies appealed for urgent action to increase vaccination levels. In 2023, half a million children across the region missed the first dose of the vaccine (MCV1) that should be given through routine immunisation services, said the organisations. Two doses of the measles vaccine are believed to be 97% effective in preventing the disease, which typically affects the respiratory system and leads to symptoms such as fever, cough, runny nose and a rash. Measles is one of the most contagious viruses for humans.

'Measles is back' WHO's Europe director Dr Hans Kluge said: \"Measles is back, and it's a wake-up call.\" He added: \"Without high vaccination rates, there is no health security... The measles virus never rests - and neither can we.\" The nation with the most infections last year was Romania which had 30,692, followed by Kazakhstan with 28,147.

In Montenegro, fewer than 50% of children have been vaccinated against measles for at least the past five years. In Bosnia and Herzegovina, the figure was less than 70%. UK officials said last month there have been more than 200 reported cases in the country and that many more were expected. Vaccination rates not back to pre-pandemic levels Measles cases in the region have generally been declining since 1997, when 216,000 were reported, reaching a low of 4,440 cases in 2016, according to the WHO and UNICEF. However, a resurgence was seen in 2018 and 2019 with 89,000 and 106,000 cases reported for those years respectively. After a drop in immunisation coverage during the COVID pandemic, cases rose significantly again in 2023 and 2024. Vaccination rates in many countries are yet to return to pre-pandemic levels, increasing the risk of outbreaks.

Information from NHS website 'Never too late to be vaccinated' Concerns about the safety of the measles vaccine have lingered for decades, after British physician Dr Andrew Wakefield and colleagues published a paper in 1998 - which has long since been retracted - linking the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine to autism. No evidence for any causal link has ever been found and Wakefield had his licence to practise medicine in the UK revoked. \"It's never too late to get vaccinated,\" said Dr Ben Kasstan-Dabush, from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, who warned that misinformation can unfortunately travel rapidly. \"Even a small decline in vaccine uptake can have devastating consequences.\" In the US, an outbreak in Texas and New Mexico, which led to the country's first measles deaths in a decade, has seen 28 more infections this week, taking the total to 256. It is the first major challenge for new health secretary and long-time vaccine sceptic Robert F Kennedy Jr."

But environmentalists said the dagger was instead pointed at \"the heart of public health\". The proposals will have to clear various legal hurdles, so are not guaranteed to stick. But if successful, they will save trillions of dollars in regulatory costs and \"hidden taxes\", Mr Zeldin said. They hope this will tackle the cost of living by lowering the price of things like cars, home heating and running a business.

The National Mining Association, which represents some coal miners, was among many industries to applaud the rollbacks. It said the change to the rule on clean power plants was \"long overdue\", as data centres and AI increase electricity demand.  The moves are part of Mr Trump's efforts to slash regulations and boost industries from coal to manufacturing, and ramp up oil and minerals production. On his first day in office, he issued a flurry of executive orders to boost fossil fuel production and withdraw from global climate efforts. Green groups have vowed to fight the proposed rollbacks in court. \"In the face of overwhelming science, it's impossible to think that the EPA could develop a contradictory finding that would stand up in court,\" said David Doniger, a climate expert at the Natural Resources Defense Council environmental group.

        "Content": "\n          Science and technology editor\n              @t0mclark3\n Technically, the hundred-mile-long, 20 mile-wide British overseas territory of South Georgia is uninhabited. Only a few visiting scientists and government fisheries inspectors occupy the island all year round. But from a wildlife perspective, it's anything but. Its shores are home to the largest number of marine birds and mammals on the planet. The impact of the world's biggest iceberg Lying 800 miles east off the Falkland Islands and a thousand miles north of Antarctica, it's one of the few fragments of land between that vast frozen continent and the rest of the world.  The part of the South Atlantic in which it sits is one of the most food-rich oceans in the world, fed by powerful circulating currents, and it's full of shrimp-like Antarctic krill. \"Krill feeds the blue whales, humpback whales, fin whales. It also feeds the gentoo penguins, macaroni penguins, chinstrap penguins and the fur seals,\" says Martin Collins, a scientist with the British Antarctic Survey, and former head of the South Georgia government, speaking to me from his office at King Edward Point on the island. The island also has some of the largest and most significant populations of elephant seals, king penguins and several species of albatross and petrel - the hardiest of ocean-going seabirds. The island has been in the headlines after the world's largest iceberg, A23a, ran aground off its south-west coast.  Concern over impact of iceberg on island's wildlife There's a concern it could impact wildlife on the island - but the timing is fortuitous, says Mr Collins. \"It's the end of the breeding season now, which means the impacts on penguins at that part of the island will be lessened. \"There may be a little bit of impact, particularly on gentoo penguins, which still forage around the island during the winter.\" From a wider conservation point of view, South Georgia is one of the world's stand-out success stories. Until the 1960s, it was a major hub for whaling. Thousands of whales were caught off its coasts and processed at a number of whaling stations - the scale of the slaughter such that the bays around the island were red with whale blood. The whalers introduced reindeer for food that nibbled and trampled unique plant life that sustained many of the island's endemic wildlife. Stowaway rats plundered the eggs and chicks of penguins and other ground nesting birds (there are no trees).  Whales returning in large numbers The South Georgia pipit, the world's most southerly songbird, was driven to the brink of extinction. But before the abandoned whaling stations have even rusted away, whales have begun returning to South Georgia in large numbers. A campaign of air-dropping poisoned bait across the inaccessible island has eradicated the rats and the pipits are booming. The seas around South Georgia were once heavily fished. The worst for wildlife were long-line vessels trying to hook high-value Chilean seabass. Call for outright ban on fishing Albatross and petrels would dive for the bait and be caught and drowned. Since 2012, the government of South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands have policed a 500,000 square-mile marine-protected area around the islands where most fishing is now banned. A few vessels are licensed to catch shrimp-like krill and seabass but only in winter when most predators are absent and under strict controls. Some conservationists are calling for fishing to be banned outright. However, the South Georgia government argues it's the income from limited fishing licences that allows them to protect and monitor the exclusion zone. Crucial at a time when funding from central government is scarce and unlikely to increase. The key threat now is the rapidly changing climate around South Georgia. \"There's evidence that the distribution of krill is moving a little further south gradually over time,\" says Mr Collins. \"We need to be really mindful of that changing climate.\" But he's optimistic too. Despite warmer oceans, numbers of some species are booming. Especially whales and fur seals. \"I've just had two king penguins walking past the windows as we were talking,\" he says. \"When I first came here in the late 1990s, there were no fur seals in this area at all. And now they're everywhere around us\"."

        "Content": "\n          Science correspondent\n              @SkyNewsThomas\n  Scientists are genetically modifying mosquitoes in the hope of stopping the spread of malaria. The technique, which uses genes taken from the honeybee and the African clawed frog, blocks normal growth of the malaria parasite inside the mosquito. It would mean a mosquito bite in regions of the world where the disease is endemic no longer carried a potential death sentence. The World Health Organisation says there were almost 600,000 deaths from malaria in 2023, three quarters of them in children under five. Dr Nikolai Windbichler, a geneticist at Imperial College London, said the GM mosquitoes could work where other attempts at malaria control have failed. \"The advantage is that nobody needs to do anything,\" he said. \"For example, with a bed net you need to impregnate it with insecticide and put it up when you go to sleep. It requires people to do something to be effective. \n                  Over half of world's population could be at risk of mosquito-borne diseases, experts warn\n                 \n                  What 2023 has taught us about... science and technology \n                 \n                  Cheap malaria vaccine developed with help of Oxford scientists approved for global rollout\n                 \"But this technology is purely genetic, so no one will have to actually do anything for it to be beneficial.\" Sky News was allowed into the insectary at Imperial College, where thousands of mosquitoes are being bred as part of the groundbreaking Transmission Zero project. Step one in the process of creating the GM mosquito is injecting the insect egg with genes from other species that make proteins that are toxic to the malaria parasite. They slow the normal development of the parasite inside the stomach of the mosquito. When the female insect bites someone to draw blood - which she needs to make eggs - the parasite is too immature to infect them and cause disease. In a second crucial step, researchers use another genetic technique to ensure all the offspring of the GM mosquitoes carry the same anti-malaria trait. Dr Windbichler said the technique meant only a relatively small number of modified mosquitoes would need to be released into the wild for the whole population to effectively become malaria resistant. \"The trait is self-propagating,\" he said. \"Over time it will get more and more common in the population. \"It will also spread geographically so that eventually every malaria transmitting mosquito in Africa could carry this.\" The research is being done in collaboration with scientists in Tanzania and is funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. There are now two vaccines against malaria, but they are expensive and only moderately effective. Drugs are also available, but the parasite is developing resistance to some of them. The genetic technique, on the other hand, is relatively cheap. After the initial lab work, the GM mosquitoes effectively do all the work.

        "Content": "Being married triples the risk of men becoming obese, research suggests. The chance of piling on the pounds increased for both sexes after marriage, however. Women's risk of being overweight was 39% higher - and men's 62% - compared with unmarried couples. But married men were 3.2 times more likely to be classed as technically obese than their unmarried counterparts, according to the study. This finding wasn't mirrored in females, which the Polish researchers said could be because women who are obese \"are more often stigmatised\" by society. Dr Alicja Cicha-Mikolajczyk, from Warsaw's National Institute of Cardiology, suggested women \"cannot accept living with obesity\" and are more likely to take action to lose weight. In the UK, the NHS generally classes obese people as having a body mass index (BMI) of above 30, and being overweight is associated with a BMI of 25-30. \n                  Labradors and humans share genes which make them more likely to become obese, study finds\n                 \n                  Cancer death rates 'almost 60% higher' in deprived areas\n                 \n                  The UK places with the most and fewest fast food outlets\n                 However, the measure (which looks only at height and weight) has been criticised by some as over simplistic. The study - which looked at 2,405 Polish people, typically aged 50 - also found getting older increased the risk of becoming heavier in both sexes. Each extra year increased the risk of being overweight by 3% in men and 4% in women; and the risk of obesity by 4% in men and 6% in women. Depression or poor health knowledge also had a significant impact on the risk of women becoming obese - but this wasn't found in men.

        "Headline": "A crimson moon will be visible in UK skies thanks to a partial lunar eclipse. But when is it, what exactly will you see and what causes it?",
        "Content": "\n          News reporter\n       The moon will turn red in the night sky tonight in an event known as a blood moon. The phenomenon only happens a handful of times a year, and this is your next chance to spot one in the UK. A blood moon is a full lunar eclipse, occurring when the Earth passes between the moon and the sun. From the UK, only a partial lunar eclipse will be visible, meaning only part of the moon will appear red. But when is it, what exactly will you see, and what causes it? Here's everything you need to know. When is the blood moon? Those who want to see it will have to get out of bed early tomorrow morning. That's because the eclipse will start to be visible at 3.57am, becoming particularly noticeable at 5.09am, according to the Royal Observatory Greenwich. It says the maximum of the eclipse in London will be at 6.19am. The full lunar eclipse will be at 6.58am UK time. But that will only be visible to people in North and South America, because in the UK the moon will already have set below the horizon. What will you see? At 3.57am, the moon will move into the Earth's penumbra - the lighter part of its shadow - making parts of it appear dark, explains Imo Bell, astronomy education assistant at the Observatory. Then at 5.09am, the part of the moon in shadow will turn reddish as the moon moves into the darker part of Earth's shadow, known as the umbra. How can I see it clearly? The phenomenon will be clear with the naked eye, weather permitting. Sky News' weather producer Jo Robinson says: \"At the end of the night, England and Wales will be mostly overcast, with some fog likely in the clearer south-east. \"For Scotland, skies will turn clearer from the north through the night, but southern parts may well remain cloudy. \"Meanwhile, Ireland and Northern Ireland can expect good clear spells. It'll be chilly for anyone heading outside to look, with a frost in places. There'll be a few showers around too, some wintry.\" You can give yourself the best possible chance of a good shot by getting a clear view of the western horizon from 5.09am, Bell says. This will allow you to see the Earth's shadow gradually cover the moon while it moves towards the horizon, before it sets after 6.19am. \"Wales, Northern Ireland, Cornwall and western parts of Scotland will be favourable because you want to delay the moon sinking below the horizon for as long as possible, so the more west, the better,\" adds Bell, who describes their first blood moon experience, in 2008, as \"magical\". \"My dad used mugs to explain how the sun, Earth, and moon would form a perfect line and then let us stay up way past bedtime to head out into the cold to watch the moon turn red,\" Bell says. What causes a blood moon? It is caused by the Earth passing between the moon and the sun, known as a lunar eclipse. During a total lunar eclipse, the Earth completely stops sunlight from directly hitting the moon as the sun and the Earth perfectly align with it. Only light that is refracted through Earth's atmosphere manages to reach the moon, with everything outside of the red wavelengths being scattered, leaving the moon looking blood red. \"This is due to the scattering of bluer hues in the sun's light through our atmosphere, leaving only oranges and reds to reach the moon - the same reason we get reddish sunrises and sunsets,\" Bell explains. The UK is only catching a partial lunar eclipse, because the moon will only be visible while the sun, Earth and moon are almost aligned, rather than fully. Read more:What we know about the asteroid that could hit EarthMusk in social media row with respected astronaut How often is there a lunar eclipse - and when is the next one? Because of the way the moon orbits the Earth, and because the Earth orbits the sun, there are always between two and five a year visible from somewhere on our planet, according to the Observatory. This might make you wonder why there are not lunar eclipses every month as the moon orbits Earth. It's because the moon's path is tilted compared to Earth's orbit around the sun, moving up and down as it goes. This means it doesn't always get in Earth's shadow. There will be an opportunity to see a total lunar eclipse in the UK on 7 September - though the view is expected to be challenging due to how low the moon will be on the horizon. There will be more information on that nearer the time. In the meantime, we hope you get a good view tomorrow."

        "Content": " A bear that had pioneering brain surgery to save his life has emerged from semi-hibernation \"looking brilliant, happy and healthy\". Boki, a European brown bear, was suffering seizures and vision problems due to a build up of fluid putting pressure on his brain. Vets feared if they didn't operate before he went into torpor (a winter dormancy similar to hibernation) he might not wake up again. In October, he had a three-hour operation to run a tube run from his brain, under his skin and down to his bladder so the excess fluid could be drained. The Edinburgh-based specialist in charge, Romain Pizzi, had only done it once before - on an Asiatic black bear in Laos. Three-year-old Boki has now made a \"remarkable recovery\" and is off his medication with no adverse effects, according to the Kent-based Wildwood Trust.

Boki was being integrated with two adult bears, Fluff and Scruff, but had to be separated after the seizures started. It's now hoped they can get reacquainted and become friends. \"While the signs are very positive, we still need to proceed with caution and to take care with the reintroduction to Fluff and Scruff,\" said head of zoo operations Mark Habben. \"This will involve boisterous play, which we want to minimise in these early stages post-torpor. \"We will monitor him very closely and, at some point over the coming months, we will conduct that introduction if everything continues to go well. \"We have to take this step for his wellbeing and theirs as well - they want to be together.\" Boki's condition is called hydrocephalus and also occurs in humans, affecting one in every 500 births. Other cases can be triggered by illness or injury later in life. However, it's believed to be rare in animals."

        "Content": "\n          News reporter\n        The Menendez brothers, who were convicted of killing their parents in their Beverly Hills mansion in 1989, will soon find out if they can be released from prison. Lyle Menendez, 56, and his 53-year-old brother Erik are serving life in prison without parole for the shotgun murders of their father and mother - Jose and Kitty Menendez. The brothers have maintained their parents abused them since they were first charged with the murders. A Netflix drama series about the brothers called Monsters, which aired in September, thrust them back into the spotlight and led to renewed calls for their release - including from their family. The brothers' lawyers asked Los Angeles prosecutors to review their sentencing, potentially paving the way for their release. A decision was expected in a resentencing hearing scheduled for 11 December last year, but it has been pushed back a number of times. But what is the case for the brothers' freedom, is there new evidence - and why has the decision been delayed? \n                  Mahmoud Khalil: Nearly 100 arrested in New York after Trump Tower protest in support of pro-Palestinian activist\n                 \n                  Donald Trump says he thinks US will annex Greenland\n                 \n                  Trump threatens EU with 200% tariffs on alcohol - including wine and champagne\n                 An old defence with new evidence The Menendez brothers, who were 21 and 18 at the time their parents died, admitted shooting them before they were found guilty of first-degree murder and conspiracy to murder in 1996. But they claim they killed them in self-defence after enduring physical, emotional and sexual abuse over many years, including being molested by their father. Prosecutors at the time contended there was no evidence of any sexual abuse. They said the brothers were after their parents' multimillion-dollar estate. The jury in their first trial in 1993 was deadlocked before the jury in their second trial found them guilty, rejecting a death sentence in favour of life without parole. But their lawyers argue that because of society's changing views on sexual abuse, the brothers may not have been convicted of first-degree murder and sentenced to life without parole today. They say they should have been charged with manslaughter rather than murder, but this was not an option for the jury during the second trial. The brothers' defence team has also uncovered a letter that Erik Menendez wrote to his cousin which is dated months before the murders, which they say alludes to him being abused by his father. Read more:Kim Kardashian visits Lyle and Erik Menendez in jailNetflix series star 'stands with' Menendez brothersMonsters creator reacts after family label drama 'grotesque' LA district attorney (DA) George Gascon briefly shared the letter to his Instagram page before deleting the post. In the handwritten letter, Erik wrote: \"I've been trying to avoid dad... every night, I stay up thinking he might come in.\" He also said he was \"afraid\" and that he needed to \"put it out of my mind\" and \"stop thinking about it\". Roy Rossello, a former member of the band Menudo, also spoke out in the Peacock documentary series Menendez + Menudo: Boys Betrayed, alleging he was sexually assaulted by Jose Menendez as a teenager in the 1980s. The band was signed under RCA Record at the time, where Jose Menendez was chief operating officer, and Mr Rossello claims he drugged and raped him. How can they be freed? Former LA district attorney George Gascon asked LA County Superior Court Judge Michael Jesic to review their convictions before he left the role in December. He recommended giving them a revised sentence of 50 years to life, which would make them immediately eligible for youth parole because they were less than 26 years old when they killed their parents. The judge has been asked to look at whether the pair have been rehabilitated, based on their behaviour in prison. A document filed by the lawyers highlights some of their achievements while behind bars, including both attaining several degrees and contributing to the community. It lists a prison \"beautification programme\" Lyle Menendez started called GreenSpace as one example, and adds that both brothers have received low-risk assessment scores, with Lyle apparently not being involved in a single fight during his time in jail. The lawyers have also submitted the letter Erik wrote to his cousin as new evidence, saying it was not seen by the jury when the brothers were sentenced in 1996 and could have influenced their decision. Roy Rossello has also provided a signed declaration of his alleged rape by Jose Menendez to the brothers' lawyers, which they say is further proof of his supposed abusive nature. In a news conference, Mr Gascon clarified that the review was not to determine whether or not the brothers killed their parents, saying it was \"factual\" and \"well established\" they had. He also said more than 300 people had been resentenced during his term as district attorney and only four had gone on to reoffend. Why has the hearing been delayed? Judge Jesic said it was partially because he needed time to review 17 boxes of documents relating to the case and was \"not ready to go forward\". But it's also because the DA who recommended the review, Mr Gascon, has been replaced by Nathan Hochman, who took office on 2 December. The judge said the delay was also to give Mr Hochman enough time to review and weigh in on the case. The new DA, a Republican-turned-independent, has differing views to his predecessor Mr Gascon, a Democrat known for his particularly progressive views. The trial was set for the end of January, but it was pushed back again to March due to the California wildfires. Big changes since resentencing trial was set LA's previous DA Gascon called for the resentencing because he believed the brothers had been rehabilitated in prison, and felt their trial would have been treated differently with today's understanding of how sexual and physical abuse affects children. This gave the Menendez brothers hope, because when prosecutors support resentencing, there is \"somewhat of a presumption\" that the court will do it, says Laurie Levenson, a former federal prosecutor and professor of criminal law at Loyola Law School in Los Angeles. But his successor, Mr Hochman, disagrees, saying earlier this month the brothers have repeatedly lied about why they killed their parents and \"fell short\" of taking full responsibility for their crimes. He has opposed the resentencing, saying it's because of their \"lack of full insight and lack of complete responsibility for their murders\". His office has submitted an 88-page document urging the judge to withdraw the previous DA's resentencing motion. It does not mean the resentencing is getting called off, but experts like Ms Levenson say it significantly reduces the likelihood of the judge ruling in the brothers' favour. Another potential road to freedom In addition to a resentencing, the brothers have also sought their freedom through a request for clemency from California governor Gavin Newsom, who has the power to free them himself. Mr Newsom, who supported Mr Gascon, ruled out making a decision until he has heard Mr Hochman's views on the brothers' case. \"The governor respects the role of the district attorney in ensuring justice is served and recognises that voters have entrusted District Attorney-elect Hochman to carry out this responsibility,\" Mr Newsom's office said in a statement on 25 November. \"The governor will defer to the DA-elect's review and analysis of the Menendez case prior to making any clemency decisions.\" But even after Mr Hochman's decision to push against the brothers' freedom, their hopes of Mr Newsome granting clemency have not disappeared. At the end of February, the governor ordered the state parole board to investigate whether the brothers would pose a risk to the public. It was a move celebrated by the Menendez's lawyers, who said in a statement: \"The family realises that the governor's action does not mean he will commute the sentences. Instead, this initial step reflects the governor's considered decision to at least obtain the information required to make a fair decision as to whether Erik and Lyle, after 35 years in prison, have done the hard work necessary to have a chance at a life outside prison.\" Mr Newsom said he wants the parole board to finish the risk assessment within 90 days. Following the assessment, there will be a hearing allowing victims' family members and prosecutors to participate in the process, according to the governor's office. Ms Levenson has suggested that because of the change at the DA's office, clemency is now the brothers' best shot at freedom. What the Menendez family says Some of the brothers' extended relatives attended the hearing on 25 November where a resentencing date was originally set. Two of their aunts testified, making what a lawyer for the siblings described during a brief news conference as \"impassioned pleas\" for Erik and Lyle to be sent home. Erik's stepdaughter said their family remains united in their effort to bring the siblings home. While the judge's delay was not \"the outcome we had hoped for,\" she said in a statement, \"we remain optimistic that it represents a step forward in securing their freedom\". The brothers themselves were scheduled to make their first court appearance in years, but the remote feed from the San Diego prison where they are incarcerated was hampered by technical issues. On 17 October, two dozen extended family members gathered for a news conference in Los Angeles. Jose Menendez's niece Anamaria Baralt spoke on their behalf, telling reporters: \"Both sides of the family are united, sharing a new bond of hope. \"This is about truth, justice and healing... Their continued incarceration serves no rehabilitative purpose.\" Ms Baralt said the brothers were victims of a \"culture that was not ready to listen\", as she called on the district attorney's office to \"take into account the full picture\". Joan Andersen VanderMolen, Kitty Menendez's sister, also told reporters: \"I had no idea the extent of the abuse they suffered at the hands of my brother-in-law. None of us did. \"We know that abuse has long effects, and victims of trauma sometimes act in ways that are very difficult to understand.\" Family not entirely united Kitty Menendez's brother, Milton Andersen, 90, has said \"the appropriate sentence\" for the pair was life in prison without parole. His lawyer said: \"He believes that there was no molestation that occurred. He believes that the motive was pure greed, because they had just learned that they were going to be taken out of the will.\""
