        "Content": "Lord Peter Mandelson has been asked to testify to the US Congress over his relationship with the paedophile financier Jeffrey Epstein. A letter from two Democrat members of the House of Representatives called on the former British ambassador to Washington to answer questions from the House Oversight Committee as part of their probe into Epstein. The disgraced peer's links with Epstein have led to calls for Sir Keir Starmer to stand down as prime minister. The prime minister's judgement has been questioned by critics over his appointment of Lord Mandelson as US ambassador, a role considered the most prestigious posting in British diplomacy. The letter to Lord Mandelson, signed by representatives Robert Garcia and Suhas Subramanyam, said: \"While you no longer serve as British ambassador to the United States and have stepped down from the House of Lords, it is clear that you possessed extensive social and business ties to Jeffrey Epstein and hold critical information pertaining to our investigation of Epstein's operations. \"Given the appalling allegations regarding Epstein's conduct, we request that you make yourself available for a transcribed interview with Committee staff regarding the crimes of Jeffrey Epstein and his co-conspirators.\" The letter added: \"Numerous pieces of evidence have come to light demonstrating your close ties to Jeffrey Epstein over the span of multiple years.\" Among the evidence, it listed Lord Mandelson's \"handwritten note\" in a 50th birthday book for Epstein in which he described him as his \"best pal\". It also highlighted the peer's stay at Epstein's New York apartment in 2009 while Epstein was serving an 18-month sentence for soliciting prostitution and soliciting a minor. Also cited were photographs of Lord Mandelson in his underwear in the latest Department of Justice release from the Epstein files. The letter gave Lord Mandelson a deadline of 27 February to respond to the two US politicians \"due to the urgency and gravity of this matter\".

The 28-year-old, a world and European champion, had been the favourite for gold after leading at the halfway stage of the event on Thursday, with track records in the first two heats. On Friday, the British athlete posted another track record on his third run - recording a 0.39-second advantage at the top of the leaderboard. Follow latest updates from Sky Sports A near faultless run in his final heat at the Milano Cortina Games saw him increase his margin of victory to 0.88 seconds, bringing the gold home with a fourth track record. Germany's Axel Jungk took his second successive Olympic ⁠silver, ​while Jungk's compatriot and ⁠defending champion Christopher ⁠Grotheer picked up ​the bronze. Marcus Wyatt, Team GB's other medal hopeful, finished ninth on Friday. In March 2025, Weston took his second world champion crown and last month he clinched his third successive overall World Cup title. His Olympic win marks the first-ever gold in the men's skeleton for Team GB. Explainer: Who is Matt Weston? Weston made his debut in skeleton in 2019, previously competing in taekwondo and securing several European and international honours. He continued in that discipline until the age of 17, when he retired due to injury. Speaking after his skeleton win, Weston said: \"[It means] everything. It means a hell of a lot to me personally. I have worked so hard for this. \"Everyone back at home, my fiancee, my family, my friends, everyone that has sacrificed for me to be here. I have missed funerals, birthdays, everything for this moment and it feels amazing.\" Sir Keir Starmer celebrated the victory, with the prime minister saying in a post on X: \"History-making. Congratulations Matt Weston!\" Team GB had won a medal in the skeleton at each of the Games since 2002 until 2018. Lizzy Yarnold secured two golds, at Sochi in 2014 and PyeongChang in 2018, while Dom Parsons was Britain's first male skeleton medallist since 1948 in South Korea, winning bronze in the men's event, and Amy Williams won gold in 2010 in Vancouver. Weston is the first individual male British competitor to win gold at a Winter Olympics since figure skater Robin Cousins in 1980. His victory comes after Ukrainian competitor Vladyslav Heraskevych was disqualified 30 minutes before the start of the session on Thursday because he defied calls to not wear his \"helmet of remembrance\" depicting athletes killed since Russia's invasion."

A strong run saw him secure the win by increasing his margin of victory to 0.88 seconds, with his fourth track record. Who is Matt Weston? Born in Tunbridge Wells, Kent, Weston started out his sporting career in a completely different discipline. He practised taekwondo up until the age of 17, winning medals at UK-based events and international honours whilst representing England abroad. At the taekwondo European Cup in 2012 he won both gold and silver, adding a silver and bronze to his collection at the International Taekwondo Federation World Cup in 2014 before retiring from the sport aged 17 due to a fracture in his back. Right until he started the selection process for British Skeleton, he also played rugby, previously representing Kent as well as his local team Sevenoaks RFC and a Saracens Academy College. His introduction to skeleton came via the British Skeleton Discover Your Gold talent identification scheme following a suggestion from his weightlifting coach, Chris Dear. Speaking to Sky News sports presenter Jacquie Beltrao, Weston said it takes a \"certain type of person\" to take part in Skeleton. \"To get over that fear when you first start and you go down and you have no brakes,\" he said. \"Whether you have a good run, a bad run, you crash or don't crash, you are going to the bottom because it's just sheet ice. Once you get over the fear and apprehension about that, it's so much fun.\" From beginner to Olympian  Weston made his debut in skeleton in 2019. Before then he completed a tense training period with the Royal Marines, which was designed to test his physical and mental fitness. He finished 15th in his debut race on the Europa Cup in Winterberg, Germany, closely followed by a silver medal in Igls, Austria, and bronze in Altenberg, Germany, just a month later. By 2020 Weston was competing on the World Cup circuit and in November 2021 he won gold for Great Britain, the first men's World Cup win in skeleton for almost 14 years. Just over two years after he made his debut, he competed as an Olympian at the Beijing winter games in 2022. In 2023, and paired with six-time world champion Martins Dukurs as a coach, Weston made major gains on both European and world stages. He won the European title in January 2023 and a week later became world champion, taking the crown by a staggering 1.49 seconds.

        "Content": "Palestine Action's co-founder has won a legal challenge over the group's ban as a terrorist organisation on two grounds. However, it will remain outlawed for now as the government intends to take the case to the Court of Appeal. Huda Ammori launched the challenge after former home secretary Yvette Cooper's decision to proscribe the group, which came into force in July last year. It followed action by members of the group that included breaking into RAF Brize Norton and spray-painting two aircraft. The ban put Palestine Action on the same footing as ISIS and al Qaeda, making membership or support of a crime punishable by up to 14 years in prison. Even wearing a T-shirt or carrying a sign with the group's name on it can carry a six-month sentence. Ms Ammori called the ruling at London's High Court \"a monumental victory both for our fundamental freedoms here in Britain and in the struggle for freedom for the Palestinian people\". She said the ban had resulted in nearly 3,000 unlawful arrests and claimed it \"was always about appeasing pro-Israel lobby groups and weapons manufacturers, and nothing to do with terrorism\". Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood said she was \"disappointed\" and disagreed with the court that the ban was disproportionate. She said she would appeal against the ruling, and the government had used a \"rigorous and evidence-based decision-making process\" when outlawing the group. \"The court has acknowledged that Palestine Action has carried out acts of terrorism, celebrated those who have taken part in those acts and promoted the use of violence,\" Ms Mahmood said in a statement. She said the ban still allowed people to protest peacefully in support of Palestinians. Ms Ammori's lawyers had argued the ban was unprecedented and compared Palestine Action - which she co-founded in 2020 - to the suffragettes. In her ruling, Judge Dame Victoria Sharp agreed Palestine Action \"promotes its ⁠political cause through criminality\". However, she said the ban was still disproportionate as it interfered with the Human Rights Act, specifically the freedom of ​expression and freedom of assembly. Read more:Activists cleared of aggravated burglary at Israel-linked defence firmThree Palestine Action members end 73-day hunger strike Legal expert Joshua Rozenberg said the court had decided a very small number of the group's members carried out acts amounting to \"terrorism\" and these hadn't reached a level that warranted a blanket ban. The Metropolitan Police said the group remains banned, \"which means expressing support is still a criminal offence\". A statement said the force would \"continue to identify offences where support for Palestine Action is being expressed\" but would \"focus on gathering evidence... for enforcement at a later date, rather than making arrests at the time\". Some 2,787 people have been arrested since the ban came into force, according to the Defend Our Juries group, which organises protests against the ban. Raza Husain KC, representing Ms Ammori, had told the court that \"priests, teachers, pensioners, retired British Army officers\" and an \"81-year-old former magistrate\" were among them. Normal People author Sally Rooney also supported the challenge. The writer said she might not be able to publish new books in the UK after saying she would donate earnings to the group. Earlier this month, six Palestine Action activists were cleared over a 2024 break-in at an Israeli-linked defence firm's site in Bristol. They were accused of spraying paint from fire extinguishers, using crowbars and hammers to break computer equipment and smashing up the disabled toilet. However, they were found not guilty of charges including aggravated burglary and violent disorder, while the jury failed to reach verdicts on allegations of criminal damage."

        "Content": "\n          International correspondent\n              @sparkomat\n Sky News understands Iranian doctor Yaser Rahmani-Rad has been arrested and held after accusing the country's security forces of arresting injured protesters inside hospitals and removing medical equipment, \"because they deserve to die\". Dr Rahmani-Rad is an internal medicine specialist who was working at the Rasul Akram public hospital in Tehran when he gave Sky News an interview at the end of January. The regime had regained control of the streets after nationwide protests had threatened to sweep Iran's clerical leaders aside. Dr Rahmani-Rad said he was shocked by the ferocity of this crackdown, adding the security forces had taken \"full control\" of the country's hospitals. \"If they realise that someone who was injured in the protests has gone to a hospital, or even if they had gone before and managed to escape them, they will arrest that person. By checking security cameras, they track them down, raid the locations, and detain them,\" he said. Iran crackdown: Doctors share disturbing accounts His colleagues said security personnel had removed patients from ventilators and other life-saving medical equipment inside hospitals. \"They said, 'let them die, they have no rights, they are against the Islamic system, and they deserve to die'.\" \n                  Former spy chief on Mandelson, Ukraine, China and Trump\n                 \n                  Trump and Netanyahu to meet for Iran discussions\n                 \n                  Iran and US to begin high-stakes talks amid fears of conflict\n                 It was a brave thing to speak out. People who criticise the regime in Iran typically request anonymity, but the medic believed the international exposure would help protect him from state forces. When I contacted Dr Rahmani-Rad the following week, he said he was fine - although he had received a visit from the security forces. Here is what he relayed to me in a series of messages: \"Without any court or summons, they announced that you no longer have the right to be active on any social media network\" \"Otherwise, you will be discharged from the hospital\" \"And you will be arrested\" \"We have been very patient with you\" \"This was the final announcement\" However, these threats did not work. The specialist posted another video on Instagram - on or around 11 February - castigating the regime for inflicting violence on people who could not afford the money required to treat their injuries. \"How could you shoot at these poor souls who don't have 200,000 or 500,000 tomans (£0.90 to £2.40) to buy antibiotics. I don't understand it. I genuinely don't understand it,\" he said. It seems these comments were poorly received. His videos have been stripped from Instagram and the page has been shut down.

I spoke to Dr Keyvan Yahia, a neuroscientist who teaches at Chemnitz Technical University in Germany. He said: \"I hadn't heard back from him for three days, so I decided to get hold of Yaser through his father. I said, 'Mr Rahmani, I didn't hear back from Yaser and given the circumstances, I must assume that something not very well happened to him. Do you have any idea?'\" \"He said, 'yes, on Monday, actually, on Monday, this week, on his arrival at the hospital... he was officially detained and taken into custody'. And he was taken, according to his father, to some undisclosed location. The family have absolutely no idea where he has gone.\" Despite official denials by the regime, doctors have been arrested and detained for providing medical treatment to people involved in the protests. Sky News understands that a fellow internal medicine specialist, Dr Golnaz Naraghi, was arrested two weeks ago. Her whereabouts was initially unknown, but according to a hospital source, she was transferred to a notorious women's prison called Qarchak near Tehran. We previously reported on the arrest of a surgeon called Alireza Golchini, who was charged with 'waging war against God' - an offence which carries the death penalty. Dr Golchini posted a phone number online for people injured in the demonstrations, and performed surgery on approximately 20 protesters. We understand that he has been released on bail and the charges have been changed. The surgeon now stands accused of 'the incitement of protest and rebellion', alongside providing medical care. He faces the prospect of two to five years in jail."

        "Content": "By home news correspondent, Mollie Malone, and long form producer, Nina Saada  Ministers have so far been unable to strip Wayne Couzens, the former police officer who raped and murdered Sarah Everard, of his public sector pension and are considering introducing legislation if required, Sky News can reveal. In March 2021, when he was a serving Metropolitan Police officer, Couzens used his police warrant to lure Sarah Everard into a fake arrest while she was walking home from a friend's house in south London, during the COVID-19 pandemic. He later raped and murdered her. In 2023, London's mayor Sadiq Khan successfully applied to the home secretary to have any money that Couzens could have earned in pension payments while serving at the Met forfeited. It's understood to be so small that it would be a negligible amount because of the short length of service there. Mr Khan, who is also the city's police and crime commissioner, at the time also believed Couzens had \"approximately seven years' pension service\" with the Civil Nuclear Constabulary (CNC), between 2011 and 2018, according to a letter shared with Sky News. This is a special force which guards nuclear facilities and is the ultimate responsibility of the energy secretary. It is not like other forces, which fall under the home secretary. \n                  Sarah Everard's mother 'tormented' by her last hours as Angiolini women's safety report is released\n                 \n                  Former Metropolitan Police officers who shared 'offensive' messages in chat with Wayne Couzens lose appeal against convictions\n                 \n                  700 investigations launched after calls to Met Police anti-corruption service as national hotline goes live\n                 In a letter from 2023 to the then energy secretary, Grant Shapps, and shared with Sky News, Mr Khan said the CNC portion of Couzens' pension \"sits outside the normal police pension regulations\". Freedom of information data obtained by Sky News shows there were no pension forfeitures from the Civil Nuclear Constabulary between 2020 and September 2025. It is understood that remains the case. A Department for Energy Security and Net Zero spokesperson told Sky News they are \"absolutely determined that Wayne Couzens does not receive a Civil Nuclear Constabulary pension\". Sky News understands there is an ongoing and complex legal process, and that the government is considering legislation, if required, in order to resolve it. The CNC said when Couzens was convicted, it made a recommendation to the employing force that he should lose his pension benefits, but that it has no decision-making powers. \"After committing such heinous crimes, Wayne Couzens should not receive a penny in taxpayer-funded pension. Londoners would be furious if he did,\" Sadiq Khan told Sky News. \"Every possible step should be taken to ensure that Wayne Couzens does not receive his Civil Nuclear Constabulary pension.\" It is possible for a pension forfeiture to give an individual back the money that they have contributed, while the state retains any money paid in by the police service, funded by the taxpayer. \"When in prison Wayne Couzens' pension would be suspended, but on his death his family could be entitled to up to 50% of his pension,\" Bethan Shellard-Dedman, a lecturer in policing practice, told Sky News. Read more from Sky News:Sarah Everard report 'disturbing'Wayne Couzens: Timeline of killerEverard's mother 'tormented' The requirements for an officer to have their pension forfeited are that they commit an offence against the Official Secrets Act or they are convicted of an offence that is either; \"gravely injurious to the interests of the state\", in connection with their \"service as a member of a police force\" or \"liable to lead to a serious loss of confidence in the public service\". \"If the forfeiture is successful, the individual officer has their contribution returned. The police force would then retain what they contributed. The amounts of which can vary,\" said Ms Shellard-Dedman. \"If you think of that pot as a whole as 100%, what the force contributes is normally around 65%. They can either get the full 65% back or they can get 30% back, in which case the officer would then retain some police pension. But it depends on the individual award.\" Couzens has been convicted of crimes committed in 2021 against Sarah Everard, and indecent exposure offences committed in February 2021 and 2020. These offences were during the period he served at the Metropolitan Police."

        "Content": "Lord Peter Mandelson has been asked to testify to the US Congress over his relationship with the paedophile financier Jeffrey Epstein. A letter from two Democrat members of the House of Representatives called on the former British ambassador to Washington to answer questions from the House Oversight Committee as part of their probe into Epstein. The disgraced peer's links with Epstein have led to calls for Sir Keir Starmer to stand down as prime minister. The prime minister's judgement has been questioned by critics over his appointment of Lord Mandelson as US ambassador, a role considered the most prestigious posting in British diplomacy. The letter to Lord Mandelson, signed by representatives Robert Garcia and Suhas Subramanyam, said: \"While you no longer serve as British ambassador to the United States and have stepped down from the House of Lords, it is clear that you possessed extensive social and business ties to Jeffrey Epstein and hold critical information pertaining to our investigation of Epstein's operations. \"Given the appalling allegations regarding Epstein's conduct, we request that you make yourself available for a transcribed interview with Committee staff regarding the crimes of Jeffrey Epstein and his co-conspirators.\" The letter added: \"Numerous pieces of evidence have come to light demonstrating your close ties to Jeffrey Epstein over the span of multiple years.\" Among the evidence, it listed Lord Mandelson's \"handwritten note\" in a 50th birthday book for Epstein in which he described him as his \"best pal\". It also highlighted the peer's stay at Epstein's New York apartment in 2009 while Epstein was serving an 18-month sentence for soliciting prostitution and soliciting a minor. Also cited were photographs of Lord Mandelson in his underwear in the latest Department of Justice release from the Epstein files. The letter gave Lord Mandelson a deadline of 27 February to respond to the two US politicians \"due to the urgency and gravity of this matter\".

Last year, the two US representatives made a similar request to Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor, who was then a prince."

        "Content": "By home news correspondent, Mollie Malone, and long form producer, Nina Saada  Ministers have so far been unable to strip Wayne Couzens, the former police officer who raped and murdered Sarah Everard, of his public sector pension and are considering introducing legislation if required, Sky News can reveal. In March 2021, when he was a serving Metropolitan Police officer, Couzens used his police warrant to lure Sarah Everard into a fake arrest while she was walking home from a friend's house in south London, during the COVID-19 pandemic. He later raped and murdered her. In 2023, London's mayor Sadiq Khan successfully applied to the home secretary to have any money that Couzens could have earned in pension payments while serving at the Met forfeited. It's understood to be so small that it would be a negligible amount because of the short length of service there. Mr Khan, who is also the city's police and crime commissioner, at the time also believed Couzens had \"approximately seven years' pension service\" with the Civil Nuclear Constabulary (CNC), between 2011 and 2018, according to a letter shared with Sky News. This is a special force which guards nuclear facilities and is the ultimate responsibility of the energy secretary. It is not like other forces, which fall under the home secretary. \n                  Sarah Everard's mother 'tormented' by her last hours as Angiolini women's safety report is released\n                 \n                  Former Metropolitan Police officers who shared 'offensive' messages in chat with Wayne Couzens lose appeal against convictions\n                 \n                  700 investigations launched after calls to Met Police anti-corruption service as national hotline goes live\n                 In a letter from 2023 to the then energy secretary, Grant Shapps, and shared with Sky News, Mr Khan said the CNC portion of Couzens' pension \"sits outside the normal police pension regulations\". Freedom of information data obtained by Sky News shows there were no pension forfeitures from the Civil Nuclear Constabulary between 2020 and September 2025. It is understood that remains the case. A Department for Energy Security and Net Zero spokesperson told Sky News they are \"absolutely determined that Wayne Couzens does not receive a Civil Nuclear Constabulary pension\". Sky News understands there is an ongoing and complex legal process, and that the government is considering legislation, if required, in order to resolve it. The CNC said when Couzens was convicted, it made a recommendation to the employing force that he should lose his pension benefits, but that it has no decision-making powers. \"After committing such heinous crimes, Wayne Couzens should not receive a penny in taxpayer-funded pension. Londoners would be furious if he did,\" Sadiq Khan told Sky News. \"Every possible step should be taken to ensure that Wayne Couzens does not receive his Civil Nuclear Constabulary pension.\" It is possible for a pension forfeiture to give an individual back the money that they have contributed, while the state retains any money paid in by the police service, funded by the taxpayer. \"When in prison Wayne Couzens' pension would be suspended, but on his death his family could be entitled to up to 50% of his pension,\" Bethan Shellard-Dedman, a lecturer in policing practice, told Sky News. Read more from Sky News:Sarah Everard report 'disturbing'Wayne Couzens: Timeline of killerEverard's mother 'tormented' The requirements for an officer to have their pension forfeited are that they commit an offence against the Official Secrets Act or they are convicted of an offence that is either; \"gravely injurious to the interests of the state\", in connection with their \"service as a member of a police force\" or \"liable to lead to a serious loss of confidence in the public service\". \"If the forfeiture is successful, the individual officer has their contribution returned. The police force would then retain what they contributed. The amounts of which can vary,\" said Ms Shellard-Dedman. \"If you think of that pot as a whole as 100%, what the force contributes is normally around 65%. They can either get the full 65% back or they can get 30% back, in which case the officer would then retain some police pension. But it depends on the individual award.\" Couzens has been convicted of crimes committed in 2021 against Sarah Everard, and indecent exposure offences committed in February 2021 and 2020. These offences were during the period he served at the Metropolitan Police."

The 28-year-old, a world and European champion, had been the favourite for gold after leading at the halfway stage of the event on Thursday, with track records in the first two heats. On Friday, the British athlete posted another track record on his third run - recording a 0.39-second advantage at the top of the leaderboard. Follow latest updates from Sky Sports A near faultless run in his final heat at the Milano Cortina Games saw him increase his margin of victory to 0.88 seconds, bringing the gold home with a fourth track record. Germany's Axel Jungk took his second successive Olympic ⁠silver, ​while Jungk's compatriot and ⁠defending champion Christopher ⁠Grotheer picked up ​the bronze. Marcus Wyatt, Team GB's other medal hopeful, finished ninth on Friday. In March 2025, Weston took his second world champion crown and last month he clinched his third successive overall World Cup title. His Olympic win marks the first-ever gold in the men's skeleton for Team GB. Explainer: Who is Matt Weston? Weston made his debut in skeleton in 2019, previously competing in taekwondo and securing several European and international honours. He continued in that discipline until the age of 17, when he retired due to injury. Speaking after his skeleton win, Weston said: \"[It means] everything. It means a hell of a lot to me personally. I have worked so hard for this. \"Everyone back at home, my fiancee, my family, my friends, everyone that has sacrificed for me to be here. I have missed funerals, birthdays, everything for this moment and it feels amazing.\" Sir Keir Starmer celebrated the victory, with the prime minister saying in a post on X: \"History-making. Congratulations Matt Weston!\" Team GB had won a medal in the skeleton at each of the Games since 2002 until 2018. Lizzy Yarnold secured two golds, at Sochi in 2014 and PyeongChang in 2018, while Dom Parsons was Britain's first male skeleton medallist since 1948 in South Korea, winning bronze in the men's event, and Amy Williams won gold in 2010 in Vancouver. Weston is the first individual male British competitor to win gold at a Winter Olympics since figure skater Robin Cousins in 1980. His victory comes after Ukrainian competitor Vladyslav Heraskevych was disqualified 30 minutes before the start of the session on Thursday because he defied calls to not wear his \"helmet of remembrance\" depicting athletes killed since Russia's invasion."

A strong run saw him secure the win by increasing his margin of victory to 0.88 seconds, with his fourth track record. Who is Matt Weston? Born in Tunbridge Wells, Kent, Weston started out his sporting career in a completely different discipline. He practised taekwondo up until the age of 17, winning medals at UK-based events and international honours whilst representing England abroad. At the taekwondo European Cup in 2012 he won both gold and silver, adding a silver and bronze to his collection at the International Taekwondo Federation World Cup in 2014 before retiring from the sport aged 17 due to a fracture in his back. Right until he started the selection process for British Skeleton, he also played rugby, previously representing Kent as well as his local team Sevenoaks RFC and a Saracens Academy College. His introduction to skeleton came via the British Skeleton Discover Your Gold talent identification scheme following a suggestion from his weightlifting coach, Chris Dear. Speaking to Sky News sports presenter Jacquie Beltrao, Weston said it takes a \"certain type of person\" to take part in Skeleton. \"To get over that fear when you first start and you go down and you have no brakes,\" he said. \"Whether you have a good run, a bad run, you crash or don't crash, you are going to the bottom because it's just sheet ice. Once you get over the fear and apprehension about that, it's so much fun.\" From beginner to Olympian  Weston made his debut in skeleton in 2019. Before then he completed a tense training period with the Royal Marines, which was designed to test his physical and mental fitness. He finished 15th in his debut race on the Europa Cup in Winterberg, Germany, closely followed by a silver medal in Igls, Austria, and bronze in Altenberg, Germany, just a month later. By 2020 Weston was competing on the World Cup circuit and in November 2021 he won gold for Great Britain, the first men's World Cup win in skeleton for almost 14 years. Just over two years after he made his debut, he competed as an Olympian at the Beijing winter games in 2022. In 2023, and paired with six-time world champion Martins Dukurs as a coach, Weston made major gains on both European and world stages. He won the European title in January 2023 and a week later became world champion, taking the crown by a staggering 1.49 seconds.

        "Content": "Palestine Action's co-founder has won a legal challenge over the group's ban as a terrorist organisation on two grounds. However, it will remain outlawed for now as the government intends to take the case to the Court of Appeal. Huda Ammori launched the challenge after former home secretary Yvette Cooper's decision to proscribe the group, which came into force in July last year. It followed action by members of the group that included breaking into RAF Brize Norton and spray-painting two aircraft. The ban put Palestine Action on the same footing as ISIS and al Qaeda, making membership or support of a crime punishable by up to 14 years in prison. Even wearing a T-shirt or carrying a sign with the group's name on it can carry a six-month sentence. Ms Ammori called the ruling at London's High Court \"a monumental victory both for our fundamental freedoms here in Britain and in the struggle for freedom for the Palestinian people\". She said the ban had resulted in nearly 3,000 unlawful arrests and claimed it \"was always about appeasing pro-Israel lobby groups and weapons manufacturers, and nothing to do with terrorism\". Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood said she was \"disappointed\" and disagreed with the court that the ban was disproportionate. She said she would appeal against the ruling, and the government had used a \"rigorous and evidence-based decision-making process\" when outlawing the group. \"The court has acknowledged that Palestine Action has carried out acts of terrorism, celebrated those who have taken part in those acts and promoted the use of violence,\" Ms Mahmood said in a statement. She said the ban still allowed people to protest peacefully in support of Palestinians. Ms Ammori's lawyers had argued the ban was unprecedented and compared Palestine Action - which she co-founded in 2020 - to the suffragettes. In her ruling, Judge Dame Victoria Sharp agreed Palestine Action \"promotes its ⁠political cause through criminality\". However, she said the ban was still disproportionate as it interfered with the Human Rights Act, specifically the freedom of ​expression and freedom of assembly. Read more:Activists cleared of aggravated burglary at Israel-linked defence firmThree Palestine Action members end 73-day hunger strike Legal expert Joshua Rozenberg said the court had decided a very small number of the group's members carried out acts amounting to \"terrorism\" and these hadn't reached a level that warranted a blanket ban. The Metropolitan Police said the group remains banned, \"which means expressing support is still a criminal offence\". A statement said the force would \"continue to identify offences where support for Palestine Action is being expressed\" but would \"focus on gathering evidence... for enforcement at a later date, rather than making arrests at the time\". Some 2,787 people have been arrested since the ban came into force, according to the Defend Our Juries group, which organises protests against the ban. Raza Husain KC, representing Ms Ammori, had told the court that \"priests, teachers, pensioners, retired British Army officers\" and an \"81-year-old former magistrate\" were among them. Normal People author Sally Rooney also supported the challenge. The writer said she might not be able to publish new books in the UK after saying she would donate earnings to the group. Earlier this month, six Palestine Action activists were cleared over a 2024 break-in at an Israeli-linked defence firm's site in Bristol. They were accused of spraying paint from fire extinguishers, using crowbars and hammers to break computer equipment and smashing up the disabled toilet. However, they were found not guilty of charges including aggravated burglary and violent disorder, while the jury failed to reach verdicts on allegations of criminal damage."

No, not Netanyahu, who Donald Trump continues to treat as a close friend. No, the target of Trump's ire was Israel's president, Isaac Herzog. The American leader said that Herzog should be \"ashamed of himself\" for failing to pardon Netanyahu, who hasn't actually been convicted of anything. Netanyahu certainly has been accused of crimes by the courts in Israel, namely bribery, fraud and breach of trust. The criminal action against him has been rolling on for nearly six years, interrupted constantly by delays and excuses. The Israeli prime minister has regularly failed to turn up for court, citing the argument that running his country takes up a lot of his time. \n                  A head-spinning two days of Trump diplomacy - but how much was theatrical hot air?\n                 \n                  Trump latest: US will 'knock the hell' out of Iran if it tries to rearm, US president says\n                 \n                  Three war fronts on the agenda as Benjamin Netanyahu set for talks with Donald Trump\n                 He always maintained that he wanted to prove his innocence in court, but then, at the end of last year, he formally requested a pardon for the charges. He said the case had become a distraction; his opponents insisted that \"only the guilty ask for a pardon\". By this time, Trump had already laid the ground, making it clear that he thought a pardon was deserved. As a president who has issued pardons to the best part of 2,000 people, charged or convicted, over the past year, he might think it's a pretty straightforward job. The Israeli president seems to disagree. Herzog issued a statement that made it clear that the legal process behind the decision was long and unwieldy, and that he couldn't just make up his mind for himself. He also said he \"deeply appreciates President Trump\", the man who had just told Herzog he should be ashamed of himself. It's hard to imagine what level of insult it would take for an Israeli politician to actually publicly condemn Trump, but we're not there yet. But there are tensions. This was Netanyahu's sixth visit to Washington DC since Trump's return to office, but it was the lowest profile. He arrived with no fanfare, and there was no press conference after the meeting. The nuances were clear, though. Netanyahu, along with colleagues in the Israeli cabinet, is worried that the Americans will end up going soft on Iran, giving them a deal on nuclear enrichment, easing sanctions and doing nothing to limit their arsenal of ballistic missiles or their control of proxies, including Hamas, Hezbollah in Lebanon or the Houthis in Yemen. \"I will not hide from you that I expressed general scepticism about the nature of any agreement with Iran,\" said Netanyahu, possibly the most critical comment he has ever made about Trump. Moments later, as if to mollify the American, he described him as \"a great friend of the State of Israel, who was like no other\". There is no hiding the schism that now lies between these two countries, for so long, so allied. Israel is desperate for action against Iran's growing stockpile of missiles, America is focused on stopping nuclear enrichment. JD Vance has poured a lot of cold water on the US taking military action, fearful of American casualties should Iran respond by targeting the country's various bases in the Middle East. Which, almost certainly, it would. Israel, behind the scenes, is making plans for what would happen if it felt it had to take unilateral action, and that still needs the buy-in of Trump's administration.

You'd assume the answer is yes, but do we know that for sure? But Netanyahu must tread carefully. He has a general election later this year, and he is certainly not guaranteed to be prime minister beyond it. He is not only facing criminal charges in Israel, but he is also indicted on war crimes charges by the International Criminal Court. There are many countries he cannot visit for fear of being arrested. Israel's prime minister is a pariah in the eyes of many, with very, very few high-profile diplomatic friends, other than one - the most powerful man in the world."

        "Content": "The Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) has secured a majority victory in the country's first election since the Gen Z-driven uprising of 2024. The BNP won a two-thirds majority, enough to form the next government and bring the potential for stability following the ousting of former prime minister Sheikh Hasina. The BNP is headed by Tarique Rahman, its prime ministerial candidate, who returned to Bangladesh in December after 17 years in self-exile in London. The 60-year-old is the son of former prime minister Khaleda Zia, who died in December. Read more:Analysis - An era-defining election for Bangladesh The vote, which was largely seen as a two-way contest between the BNP and an 11-party alliance led by the Islamist Jamaat-e-Islami, took place on Thursday amid tight security and concerns of democratic backsliding and rising political violence. A clear outcome in the vote was widely seen as crucial for restoring political stability in the Muslim-majority country of 175 million people. \n                  Bangladesh votes in first general election since bloody ousting of Sheikh Hasina\n                 \n                  Bangladesh hands down jail sentences to former PM and her Labour MP niece\n                 \n                  Bangladesh's first female prime minister Khaleda Zia dies at 80\n                 Asia correspondent This was a very decisive, sweeping victory for the BNP.  It marks a huge turnaround for Tarique Rahman after 17 years in self-imposed exile and for his supporters, many who were thrown in jail under Sheikh Hasina’s administration.  Rahman has promised the country that the BNP is the party of change.  But this is far from their first rodeo - the party has been in power several times in the last six decades and Rahman hails from a long-established political dynasty.  It’s a big intray he has to tackle.  First, the party needs to try and revive a very sluggish economy. Before Covid, Bangladesh was one of the fastest growing countries in Asia. But the pandemic slowed down exports and now they’ve got inflation to contend with.  Then there’s the sweeping constitutional reforms to deliver after a period of extreme political upheaval- the government is now expected to establish good governance, social justice and critically, guard against the return of authoritarianism.  The student protesters who managed to topple Sheikh Hasina in the mass protests of 2024, won’t be going easy on them - they want swift and significant change.  But achieving unity will be a delicate endeavour.  Hasina’s party, the Awami League, was banned from running in this election.  And there’s the rising success of Jamaat-e-Islami to navigate- the BNP’s ally-turned-rival who delivered its strongest showing yet this election.  One country who will be keeping an incredibly close eye on Bangladesh is India.  Many Bangladeshis believe Delhi had a role in enabling Sheikh Hasina’s authoritarian rule. India’s Prime Minister Narendra Modi was quick to congratulate the BNP - perhaps a sign of an olive branch after a very tense period in relations between the neighbours.\n\n The bloody student-led revolt of July 2024, which the UN estimates resulted in the deaths of 1,400 people, led to the downfall of Hasina, sending her to exile in India. Hasina's Awami League party has since been banned from all political activities, while an interim government led by Muhammad Yunus, a Nobel Peace Prize laureate, has been in place since her ousting. Alongside the election, people were also taking part in a referendum on changes to the constitution, including the introduction of a two-term limit for the prime minister and increasing women's representation. Bangladesh's parliament has 350 seats, with 300 of those elected directly from single-member constituencies and 50 reserved for women. The BNP, seen as the frontrunner in the election, was founded by Mr Rahman's father, Ziaur Rahman, in 1978. For much of the past two decades, the party has been in opposition to the Awami League, boycotting several elections and accusing Hasina's government of systematic vote rigging and political repression. Mr Rahman's self-imposed exile to the UK came after Hasina's government pursued multiple corruption and criminal cases against him - charges which he has denied. The cases were dropped after Hasina's government collapsed, paving the way for his return to the country.

Mr Zardari added that Pakistan \"reaffirms strong support for democratic partnership and shared progress ahead\"."

The 28-year-old, a world and European champion, had been the favourite for gold after leading at the halfway stage of the event on Thursday, with track records in the first two heats. On Friday, the British athlete posted another track record on his third run - recording a 0.39-second advantage at the top of the leaderboard. Follow latest updates from Sky Sports A near faultless run in his final heat at the Milano Cortina Games saw him increase his margin of victory to 0.88 seconds, bringing the gold home with a fourth track record. Germany's Axel Jungk took his second successive Olympic ⁠silver, ​while Jungk's compatriot and ⁠defending champion Christopher ⁠Grotheer picked up ​the bronze. Marcus Wyatt, Team GB's other medal hopeful, finished ninth on Friday. In March 2025, Weston took his second world champion crown and last month he clinched his third successive overall World Cup title. His Olympic win marks the first-ever gold in the men's skeleton for Team GB. Explainer: Who is Matt Weston? Weston made his debut in skeleton in 2019, previously competing in taekwondo and securing several European and international honours. He continued in that discipline until the age of 17, when he retired due to injury. Speaking after his skeleton win, Weston said: \"[It means] everything. It means a hell of a lot to me personally. I have worked so hard for this. \"Everyone back at home, my fiancee, my family, my friends, everyone that has sacrificed for me to be here. I have missed funerals, birthdays, everything for this moment and it feels amazing.\" Sir Keir Starmer celebrated the victory, with the prime minister saying in a post on X: \"History-making. Congratulations Matt Weston!\" Team GB had won a medal in the skeleton at each of the Games since 2002 until 2018. Lizzy Yarnold secured two golds, at Sochi in 2014 and PyeongChang in 2018, while Dom Parsons was Britain's first male skeleton medallist since 1948 in South Korea, winning bronze in the men's event, and Amy Williams won gold in 2010 in Vancouver. Weston is the first individual male British competitor to win gold at a Winter Olympics since figure skater Robin Cousins in 1980. His victory comes after Ukrainian competitor Vladyslav Heraskevych was disqualified 30 minutes before the start of the session on Thursday because he defied calls to not wear his \"helmet of remembrance\" depicting athletes killed since Russia's invasion."

        "Content": "\n          International correspondent\n              @sparkomat\n Sky News understands Iranian doctor Yaser Rahmani-Rad has been arrested and held after accusing the country's security forces of arresting injured protesters inside hospitals and removing medical equipment, \"because they deserve to die\". Dr Rahmani-Rad is an internal medicine specialist who was working at the Rasul Akram public hospital in Tehran when he gave Sky News an interview at the end of January. The regime had regained control of the streets after nationwide protests had threatened to sweep Iran's clerical leaders aside. Dr Rahmani-Rad said he was shocked by the ferocity of this crackdown, adding the security forces had taken \"full control\" of the country's hospitals. \"If they realise that someone who was injured in the protests has gone to a hospital, or even if they had gone before and managed to escape them, they will arrest that person. By checking security cameras, they track them down, raid the locations, and detain them,\" he said. Iran crackdown: Doctors share disturbing accounts His colleagues said security personnel had removed patients from ventilators and other life-saving medical equipment inside hospitals. \"They said, 'let them die, they have no rights, they are against the Islamic system, and they deserve to die'.\" \n                  Former spy chief on Mandelson, Ukraine, China and Trump\n                 \n                  Trump and Netanyahu to meet for Iran discussions\n                 \n                  Iran and US to begin high-stakes talks amid fears of conflict\n                 It was a brave thing to speak out. People who criticise the regime in Iran typically request anonymity, but the medic believed the international exposure would help protect him from state forces. When I contacted Dr Rahmani-Rad the following week, he said he was fine - although he had received a visit from the security forces. Here is what he relayed to me in a series of messages: \"Without any court or summons, they announced that you no longer have the right to be active on any social media network\" \"Otherwise, you will be discharged from the hospital\" \"And you will be arrested\" \"We have been very patient with you\" \"This was the final announcement\" However, these threats did not work. The specialist posted another video on Instagram - on or around 11 February - castigating the regime for inflicting violence on people who could not afford the money required to treat their injuries. \"How could you shoot at these poor souls who don't have 200,000 or 500,000 tomans (£0.90 to £2.40) to buy antibiotics. I don't understand it. I genuinely don't understand it,\" he said. It seems these comments were poorly received. His videos have been stripped from Instagram and the page has been shut down. Read more from Sky News:Bangladesh's historic electionAnalysis: Trump and Israel's tensionsIS detainees moved from Syria to Iraq Dr Rahmani-Rad's friends are unable to contact him. I spoke to Dr Keyvan Yahia, a neuroscientist who teaches at Chemnitz Technical University in Germany. He said: \"I hadn't heard back from him for three days, so I decided to get hold of Yaser through his father. I said, 'Mr Rahmani, I didn't hear back from Yaser and given the circumstances, I must assume that something not very well happened to him. Do you have any idea?'\" \"He said, 'yes, on Monday, actually, on Monday, this week, on his arrival at the hospital... he was officially detained and taken into custody'. And he was taken, according to his father, to some undisclosed location. The family have absolutely no idea where he has gone.\" Despite official denials by the regime, doctors have been arrested and detained for providing medical treatment to people involved in the protests. Sky News understands that a fellow internal medicine specialist, Dr Golnaz Naraghi, was arrested two weeks ago. Her whereabouts was initially unknown, but according to a hospital source, she was transferred to a notorious women's prison called Qarchak near Tehran. We previously reported on the arrest of a surgeon called Alireza Golchini, who was charged with 'waging war against God' - an offence which carries the death penalty. Dr Golchini posted a phone number online for people injured in the demonstrations, and performed surgery on approximately 20 protesters. We understand that he has been released on bail and the charges have been changed. The surgeon now stands accused of 'the incitement of protest and rebellion', alongside providing medical care. He faces the prospect of two to five years in jail."

A strong run saw him secure the win by increasing his margin of victory to 0.88 seconds, with his fourth track record. Who is Matt Weston? Born in Tunbridge Wells, Kent, Weston started out his sporting career in a completely different discipline. He practised taekwondo up until the age of 17, winning medals at UK-based events and international honours whilst representing England abroad. At the taekwondo European Cup in 2012 he won both gold and silver, adding a silver and bronze to his collection at the International Taekwondo Federation World Cup in 2014 before retiring from the sport aged 17 due to a fracture in his back. Right until he started the selection process for British Skeleton, he also played rugby, previously representing Kent as well as his local team Sevenoaks RFC and a Saracens Academy College. His introduction to skeleton came via the British Skeleton Discover Your Gold talent identification scheme following a suggestion from his weightlifting coach, Chris Dear. Speaking to Sky News sports presenter Jacquie Beltrao, Weston said it takes a \"certain type of person\" to take part in Skeleton. \"To get over that fear when you first start and you go down and you have no brakes,\" he said. \"Whether you have a good run, a bad run, you crash or don't crash, you are going to the bottom because it's just sheet ice. Once you get over the fear and apprehension about that, it's so much fun.\" From beginner to Olympian  Weston made his debut in skeleton in 2019. Before then he completed a tense training period with the Royal Marines, which was designed to test his physical and mental fitness. He finished 15th in his debut race on the Europa Cup in Winterberg, Germany, closely followed by a silver medal in Igls, Austria, and bronze in Altenberg, Germany, just a month later. By 2020 Weston was competing on the World Cup circuit and in November 2021 he won gold for Great Britain, the first men's World Cup win in skeleton for almost 14 years. Just over two years after he made his debut, he competed as an Olympian at the Beijing winter games in 2022. In 2023, and paired with six-time world champion Martins Dukurs as a coach, Weston made major gains on both European and world stages. He won the European title in January 2023 and a week later became world champion, taking the crown by a staggering 1.49 seconds.

On Wednesday, Ms Bondi gave her first sworn testimony since the release of the Epstein files, which at times descended into a shouting match with Democrats.

She said the second victim was a man who was found in his garden. The storm was described as having \"uncommon strength\" by French weather service Meteo-France, with key southwestern parts of the country remaining on high flood alert. Electricity network operator Enedis said the storm left up to 900,000 customers without power at its peak. Power crews have been racing to restore electricity, with Enedis deploying 2,100 technicians. By Friday morning, around half of those affected had had their power restored. \n                  DNA found on gun is match to both identical twins - so who is the killer?\n                 \n                  Have a baby while you still can, France to tell 29-year-olds\n                 \n                  Louvre releases photos of crown damaged in heist - but insists it will be restored\n                 Red flood alerts for Gironde and Lot-et-Garonne will remain in place until Saturday.

The aide told Epstein that he planned to hide them in tissue boxes at the house. The emails were among millions of documents released by the US Department of Justice (DoJ) last month. In an email on 5 February 2014, Epstein instructed the associate: \"Let's get three motion detected hidden cameras, that record, thanks.\" (sic) Follow - Epstein files latest Five hours later, he received a reply: \"Jeffrey, I already two purchased the Motion sensor camera from the Spy Store in fort Lauderdale yesterday, I charged them last night and figuring our (sic) how to work them as we speak … I'm installing them into Kleenex boxes now.\" The Sky News Data & Forensics team has been reviewing more than a thousand fragmented videos released by the DoJ. \n                  Nearly one-fifth of improvement to hospital waiting list under Labour down to non-clinical activity\n                 \n                  Andrew and Mandelson photos in Epstein files were taken inside US paedophile's homes, Sky News analysis finds\n                 \n                  What do we know about the number of people killed in Iran protests?\n                 Many of them appear to have been filmed in Epstein's office at his Florida home.

Sky News is unable to confirm when the footage on the office cameras was filmed. We know from police documents that victims feared they were being secretly recorded. These newly uncovered emails and images analysed by Sky News suggest that was indeed the case. US attorney general accused of 'lacking empathy' It comes after Donald Trump's attorney general Pam Bondi clashed repeatedly with critics during a lengthy committee hearing earlier this week. On Wednesday, Ms Bondi gave her first sworn testimony since the release of the Epstein files, which at times descended into a shouting match with Democrats. Epstein survivors later accused her of lacking empathy and humanity, while critics claimed that because not all documents have been released, and many have been heavily redacted, some powerful figures are still being protected.

However, the US attorney general refused to take personal responsibility for initial failures to hide the names of some victims in the files and said staff had done their best under pressure."

        "Content": "By Adam Parsons, Middle East Correspondent  In the Middle East, nothing is ever straightforward, and so it was.  Benjamin Netanyahu had barely landed back in Tel Aviv when his friend in the White House was launching a stinging attack upon the man at the top of Israeli politics. No, not Netanyahu, who Donald Trump continues to treat as a close friend. No, the target of Trump's ire was Israel's president, Isaac Herzog. The American leader said that Herzog should be \"ashamed of himself\" for failing to pardon Netanyahu, who hasn't actually been convicted of anything. Netanyahu certainly has been accused of crimes by the courts in Israel, namely bribery, fraud and breach of trust. The criminal action against him has been rolling on for nearly six years, interrupted constantly by delays and excuses. The Israeli prime minister has regularly failed to turn up for court, citing the argument that running his country takes up a lot of his time. \n                  A head-spinning two days of Trump diplomacy - but how much was theatrical hot air?\n                 \n                  Trump latest: US will 'knock the hell' out of Iran if it tries to rearm, US president says\n                 \n                  Three war fronts on the agenda as Benjamin Netanyahu set for talks with Donald Trump\n                 He always maintained that he wanted to prove his innocence in court, but then, at the end of last year, he formally requested a pardon for the charges. He said the case had become a distraction; his opponents insisted that \"only the guilty ask for a pardon\". By this time, Trump had already laid the ground, making it clear that he thought a pardon was deserved. As a president who has issued pardons to the best part of 2,000 people, charged or convicted, over the past year, he might think it's a pretty straightforward job. The Israeli president seems to disagree. Herzog issued a statement that made it clear that the legal process behind the decision was long and unwieldy, and that he couldn't just make up his mind for himself. He also said he \"deeply appreciates President Trump\", the man who had just told Herzog he should be ashamed of himself. It's hard to imagine what level of insult it would take for an Israeli politician to actually publicly condemn Trump, but we're not there yet. But there are tensions. This was Netanyahu's sixth visit to Washington DC since Trump's return to office, but it was the lowest profile. He arrived with no fanfare, and there was no press conference after the meeting. The nuances were clear, though. Netanyahu, along with colleagues in the Israeli cabinet, is worried that the Americans will end up going soft on Iran, giving them a deal on nuclear enrichment, easing sanctions and doing nothing to limit their arsenal of ballistic missiles or their control of proxies, including Hamas, Hezbollah in Lebanon or the Houthis in Yemen. \"I will not hide from you that I expressed general scepticism about the nature of any agreement with Iran,\" said Netanyahu, possibly the most critical comment he has ever made about Trump. Moments later, as if to mollify the American, he described him as \"a great friend of the State of Israel, who was like no other\". There is no hiding the schism that now lies between these two countries, for so long, so allied. Israel is desperate for action against Iran's growing stockpile of missiles, America is focused on stopping nuclear enrichment. JD Vance has poured a lot of cold water on the US taking military action, fearful of American casualties should Iran respond by targeting the country's various bases in the Middle East. Which, almost certainly, it would. Israel, behind the scenes, is making plans for what would happen if it felt it had to take unilateral action, and that still needs the buy-in of Trump's administration.

You'd assume the answer is yes, but do we know that for sure? But Netanyahu must tread carefully. He has a general election later this year, and he is certainly not guaranteed to be prime minister beyond it. He is not only facing criminal charges in Israel, but he is also indicted on war crimes charges by the International Criminal Court. There are many countries he cannot visit for fear of being arrested. Israel's prime minister is a pariah in the eyes of many, with very, very few high-profile diplomatic friends, other than one - the most powerful man in the world."

The US health secretary, often called RFK Jr, made the confession to podcaster Theo Von during an episode of his show, This Past Weekend. It came as the pair discussed their shared history of drug abuse, and attending support meetings together before they got cancelled during COVID.

        "Content": "A former au pair who conspired with her married employer-turned-lover to murder his wife and a stranger has been jailed for 10 years in the US. Juliana Peres Magalhaes, 25, shot Joseph Ryan dead while her lover, Brendan Banfield, 40, was fatally stabbing his wife, Christine, in the couple's home in northern Virginia in February 2023. The Brazilian woman might have been released after giving evidence against Banfield in return for accepting a downgraded charge of manslaughter, under a deal she struck with prosecutors in 2024. Instead, Fairfax Chief Circuit Court Judge Penney Azcarate handed her the state's maximum possible sentence for the crime on Friday, telling her she didn't deserve anything other than \"incarceration and a life of reflection on what you have done to the victim and his family. May it weigh heavily on your soul\". Calling it the \"most serious manslaughter scenario\" the court had ever seen, according to Sky News' US partner NBC, the judge rejected a sentencing recommendation of time served because the pair's plan \"did not work without your full involvement\". In a statement to the victims' families, Magalhaes, who waited months before agreeing to cooperate with prosecutors in their case against Banfield, said: \"I know my remorse cannot bring you peace. \"I lost myself in a relationship, and left my morals and values behind. I hope someday I can be forgiven, as I hope to be able to forgive myself.\" \n                  Man in 'au pair affair' found guilty of double murder\n                 \n                  Man on trial in Virginia accused of plotting double murder with Brazilian au pair\n                 \n                  Drunk raccoon behind liquor store rampage suspected of other 'break-ins'\n                 Prosecutors said they continued their affair for months after the killings. Banfield was found guilty of the aggravated murder of his wife and Mr Ryan earlier this month, and could spend the rest of his life behind bars. Magalhaes told her own trial that she and Banfield, an IRS agent, used his wife's laptop to set up an online account in her name on a sexual fetish website in a catfishing scheme. Mr Ryan responded, and he was persuaded to come to Banfield's home for what he believed to be a fake-rape fantasy involving a knife with Ms Banfield. The lovers took Banfield's four-year-old child to the basement, and then went to the bedroom, where she said Banfield shot Mr Ryan and stabbed his wife in the neck.

The plotters planned to tell police they shot Mr Ryan after he stabbed Ms Banfield, Magalhaes said in court.

Over the last three weeks, the US military escorted detainees from 60 different nationalities from prisons run by the US-backed and Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) in northeastern Syria to Baghdad. The transfer began after a rapid offensive by Syrian government forces against the SDF, which has guarded the IS detainees and the facilities where they were incarcerated for years.

Sky News has learnt that the 20 top-flight sides were informed at a shareholder meeting this week that the Premier League had begun exploring an overhaul of some of its commercial rights activities that would mirror a structure used by a number of elite US sports. One source familiar with the presentation made by Premier League executives said its initial modelling projected that selling 60% of pitch-side advertising on a centralised basis, and expanding its roster of top-tier partners from seven to 10, could generate an additional £750m of revenue each year. The enormous incremental sum underlines the enduring commercial appeal of English men's top-flight football at a time when a financial redistribution agreement with the English Football League remains far from being finalised. Sources said the presentation was made on an exploratory basis, and that there were as yet no firm plans to proceed with such a revamp. The Premier League's current syndicate of top-tier partners includes Barclays, Microsoft, EA and Guinness. It also has licensing deals with several companies, including Topps, Football Manager and Sorare. \n                  DP World boss leaves ports and P&O owner amid questions over Epstein links\n                 \n                  Amazon rolls out new payment method - but consumer expert says you should think twice | Money blog\n                 \n                  There are more railcards than you think - here is how you can benefit\n                 One club executive at the meeting is said to have raised concerns that an expansion in the number of Premier League partners would raise the likelihood of conflicts with individual clubs' commercial deals.

        "Content": "The Emirati businessman credited with turning DP World into a global logistics powerhouse has left the company amid questions over his links to the disgraced paedophile financier Jeffrey Epstein. Sultan Ahmed bin Sulayem was the chairman and CEO of the Dubai based group and its earlier entities for more than four decades. Its interests include 80 ports, including the London Gateway, equating to roughly 10% of the market. It is also the owner of P&O Ferries - the UK operator that infamously sacked 800 seafarers in favour of cheaper agency staff in 2022. Follow - Epstein files latest Business and economics correspondent The publication of a string of lewd emails exchanged with Epstein, continuing long after the paedophile financier had been convicted, made Sultan Ahmed Bin Sulayem's position untenable even for a company with a high tolerance for external pressure.\n As the owner of P&O Ferries, DP World did not budge amid public outcry over the summary dismissal of more than 800 seafarers in March 2022, insisting it was a sound business decision.\n\n And in late 2024 bin Sulayem was involved in a public row with Sir Keir Starmer after he threatened to withdraw a planned £1bn expansion of DP World’s London Gateway port after criticism from the then transport minister Louise Haigh. That deal was patched up in-person, with bin Sulayem attending a government investment summit to shake hands. As recently as March last year he travelled to the UK to meet junior minister Poppy Gustafsson at London Gateway. Interviewed by Sky News on that visit, he said DP World had been “discredited” by Ms Haigh’s comments. In the last fortnight he has found himself in that position. DP World offered no comment following the first Epstein revelations but the threat to future business became tangible in recent days, with Canadian pension fund La Caisse and UK development finance arm British International Investment halting joint ventures. The company may also have been alive to the impact on 115,000 staff around the world of continuing to be led by a man evidently close to Epstein and his excesses. Under new leadership it will hope to move on. A statement announcing his successors did not mention bin Sulayem but it was later confirmed that he had resigned. The, now former, CEO and DP World had come under pressure after new investment in the company was suspended by a number of international partners amid questions over his links with Epstein. \n                  Trump's major breakaway from climate science\n                 \n                  Epstein asked staff to install hidden video cameras at his Florida home, email exchange shows\n                 \n                  Epstein survivors accuse Pam Bondi of lacking 'humanity and integrity' after fiery justice committee testimony\n                 British International Investment (BII) and ​Canada's second-largest pension fund withdrew funding following the publication of communications in the so-called Epstein files which showed bin Sulayem had allegedly discussed women with the late disgraced US financier.

        "Content": "\n          Science and technology editor\n              @t0mclark3\n More than 10 years ago, I filmed my kids for a report on the impact of screens on young minds. My eldest daughter was six at the time, her twin sisters nearly three. They didn't have their own devices - Instagram, Snapchat and YouTube were beyond their imagination. TikTok hadn't even been invented. Yet now as teenagers their lives, like pretty much every other child we know, are dominated by social media. Snapchat is central to their social lives and TikTok is a go-to dopamine fix. As parents we try our best to pry the devices out of their hands and limit their screen time. No surprise the idea of a government-mandated ban is popular with parents, less so with kids. \"We've been born into a world with social media so it's a bit unfair if you just take it away from people who are younger,\" said one of my 13-year-olds. Especially, she adds, \"when they're influenced by adults who are also on their phones.\" Fair point. But we've just about had enough of arguing with them about it. \n                  Instagram use can be 'problematic' but not addictive, says app's chief\n                 \n                  Beth Rigby: The constant challenges I face keeping my kids safe in the new Wild West\n                 \n                  Instagram and YouTube 'engineer addiction' in young people, landmark trial hears\n                 Now it looks like we've reached a point where the majority of people are starting to think the same. France and Spain are promising laws to ban child access to social media as early as this year. Austria, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, Greece, Italy and Slovenia have proposed similar legislation. Read more:The challenges I face keeping my kids safe in the new Wild WestDo you know what your kids see online?Instagram and YouTube 'engineer addiction' Portugal is considering parental consent for child social media access. Last month the Westminster government said it would consult on the issue of social media for the under-16s. As a bloc, the EU has said it supports a Europe-wide ban. A tipping point? So, have we finally reached a tipping point where social media companies will be forced to amend their products? \"We knew cigarettes were harmful and addictive and kill people for decades before we actually got legislation that made a difference,\" said Clare Melford, chief executive of the Global Disinformation Index. \"Social-media companies have only been around for 15, 20 years. So it is relatively quick on a historical scale, but for those of us who have teenagers now, it's not quick enough.\" White House backs Big Tech A Big Tech-backing White House isn't helping. US secretary of state Marco Rubio in December banned Ms Melford and three other European online safety campaigners from entering the US. Another, a legal resident in New York, was threatened with deportation. \"I wasn't surprised because we know the impact of Big Tech and big money on government in America and around the world,\" said Imran Ahmed, the British boss of US-based Centre for Countering Digital Hate (CCDH). \"But of course, it was shocking as a family to be threatened with potential detention just for the things I said.\" Tech bros fight back The tech bros are fighting back too. Elon Musk has been a target of European ire over allegedly extremist content on his platform and his Grok AI's (now curtailed) \"nudification\" powers. When Spain's Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez announced his social media ban earlier this month, Musk hit out. \"Dirty Sanchez,\" he posted on X, the platform he owns. It is Mr Sanchez, not he, who is \"the true fascist totalitarian\" as well as \"a tyrant and traitor to the people of Spain\". But it would be wrong to think the White House and social media firms are in step with wider US public opinion. US states back child social media bans American parents are angry too and their elected representatives know it. US states, like Mr Rubio's Florida, have backed child social media bans. Regulations to protect kids online are gaining traction and rare bipartisan support in Congress. In the absence of hope for federal restrictions, court cases, like one under way in California this week, centring on the \"addictiveness\" of apps, are also putting pressure on social media platforms. If successful, it may even force them to amend their offerings to children. \"From my perspective... we are further along in that battle than we ever have been,\" said Mr Ahmed from the CCDH. \"I think that ultimately we will be able to renegotiate the toxic relationship that we have with tech, where they are exploiting rather than enriching our kids.\" It now looks like public opinion will ultimately force Big Tech to make social media a safer, better place for children. But given the industry's deep pockets and influence, I'm expecting to be arguing with my kids about their screens for a while yet."

        "Content": "Palestine Action's co-founder has won a legal challenge over the group's ban as a terrorist organisation on two grounds. However, it will remain outlawed for now as the government intends to take the case to the Court of Appeal. Huda Ammori launched the challenge after former home secretary Yvette Cooper's decision to proscribe the group, which came into force in July last year. It followed action by members of the group that included breaking into RAF Brize Norton and spray-painting two aircraft. The ban put Palestine Action on the same footing as ISIS and al Qaeda, making membership or support of a crime punishable by up to 14 years in prison. Even wearing a T-shirt or carrying a sign with the group's name on it can carry a six-month sentence. Ms Ammori called the ruling at London's High Court \"a monumental victory both for our fundamental freedoms here in Britain and in the struggle for freedom for the Palestinian people\". She said the ban had resulted in nearly 3,000 unlawful arrests and claimed it \"was always about appeasing pro-Israel lobby groups and weapons manufacturers, and nothing to do with terrorism\". Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood said she was \"disappointed\" and disagreed with the court that the ban was disproportionate. She said she would appeal against the ruling, and the government had used a \"rigorous and evidence-based decision-making process\" when outlawing the group. \"The court has acknowledged that Palestine Action has carried out acts of terrorism, celebrated those who have taken part in those acts and promoted the use of violence,\" Ms Mahmood said in a statement. She said the ban still allowed people to protest peacefully in support of Palestinians. Ms Ammori's lawyers had argued the ban was unprecedented and compared Palestine Action - which she co-founded in 2020 - to the suffragettes. In her ruling, Judge Dame Victoria Sharp agreed Palestine Action \"promotes its ⁠political cause through criminality\". However, she said the ban was still disproportionate as it interfered with the Human Rights Act, specifically the freedom of ​expression and freedom of assembly. Read more:Activists cleared of aggravated burglary at Israel-linked defence firmThree Palestine Action members end 73-day hunger strike Legal expert Joshua Rozenberg said the court had decided a very small number of the group's members carried out acts amounting to \"terrorism\" and these hadn't reached a level that warranted a blanket ban. The Metropolitan Police said the group remains banned, \"which means expressing support is still a criminal offence\". A statement said the force would \"continue to identify offences where support for Palestine Action is being expressed\" but would \"focus on gathering evidence... for enforcement at a later date, rather than making arrests at the time\". Some 2,787 people have been arrested since the ban came into force, according to the Defend Our Juries group, which organises protests against the ban. Raza Husain KC, representing Ms Ammori, had told the court that \"priests, teachers, pensioners, retired British Army officers\" and an \"81-year-old former magistrate\" were among them. Normal People author Sally Rooney also supported the challenge. The writer said she might not be able to publish new books in the UK after saying she would donate earnings to the group. Earlier this month, six Palestine Action activists were cleared over a 2024 break-in at an Israeli-linked defence firm's site in Bristol. They were accused of spraying paint from fire extinguishers, using crowbars and hammers to break computer equipment and smashing up the disabled toilet. However, they were found not guilty of charges including aggravated burglary and violent disorder, while the jury failed to reach verdicts on allegations of criminal damage."

        "Content": "Sir Keir Starmer should make tackling misogyny the sixth key mission of his government, Harriet Harman has said. The former Labour cabinet minister told our political editor Beth Rigby on the Electoral Dysfunction podcast that the work so far to tackle it is \"just not good enough\", and women's voices need to be respected in government. Her comments come after the most difficult week of Sir Keir's premiership that saw him fighting for his political future. Two of his closest advisers, as well as the nation's most senior civil servant, have left Downing Street in less than a week as he has sought to regain control. 👉 Click here to listen to Electoral Dysfunction on your podcast app 👈 The fallout from Peter Mandelson's appointment as US ambassador, as well as the revelation that the prime minister knew his former communications chief, Matthew Doyle, had an association with a convicted paedophile before nominating him to the House of Lords, saw Sir Keir accused of prioritising a \"boys club\" culture over the views and experiences of women. For the first time since taking office in July 2024, he addressed a meeting of the Women's Parliamentary Labour Party in which he promised that culture change in his government is coming. \n                  Police will not investigate activists going door-to-door asking people to stop buying Israeli products\n                 \n                  EU is 'the biggest prize', Reeves says - as Labour seek closer ties\n                 \n                  Starmer's ex-comms chief should lose peerage over links to paedophile, says Labour chair\n                 Speaking on the Electoral Dysfunction podcast, Baroness Harman said he needed to go much further in making tackling misogyny a priority of his government, suggesting that he make it the sixth headline aim of his administration, alongside economic growth, expanding clean energy, fixing the NHS, making the streets safe, and breaking down opportunity barriers. She told Beth Rigby: \"I suggested that - you know, Keir Starmer has got these five missions - that we make a sixth mission of actually sorting out misogyny and culture change. \"And I think that there is a recognition now that it's not just good enough to - sometimes people have said, 'Keir has said something on one day, and then he is moved on to something else on the following days' - and certainly there's a lot going on, but this has got to be seen through.\" Women 'not part of the decision-making' The senior Labour peer also argued that Lord Mandelson would not have been made the UK's ambassador to the US if a woman had been in the room, given his known links to convicted paedophile Jeffrey Epstein. \"It wouldn't have been set aside as something that could be brushed past and then just crack on with the appointment,\" she said. \"The problem about misogyny is not just the discrimination that's meted out to women around and about, but it's also you make bad decisions because you've only got one view in the room - men's views - and they don't cognise issues in the way.\" Baroness Harman also said the phrase \"in the room\" is \"quite bad\" because more senior men will make a decision, and then point to the more junior women to be able to say, \"see, there's a woman in the room\". \"Well, she is in the room, but she's not part of the decision-making,\" she continued. \"Actually it's about partnership in decision-making. And that's what they've got to aim for - not just to get women in positions, not just to get women in the room, but to have real equality of decision-making and respect for what women need to contribute for the government to actually get itself on track.\" Inquiry needed into 'UK's Epstein' Former Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson also noted that the women abused by rich and powerful men have not seen justice done. Baroness Harman echoed former prime minister Gordon Brown's call for the police in the UK to investigate the trafficking of women, and called for a \"proper public inquiry\" into the more than 400 allegations of sexual misconduct against the now deceased former Harrods boss Mohamed al Fayed. She said: \"I met on Tuesday this week with some of the victims of al Fayed, and they were saying [that] to see on television minister after minister, everybody's saying, 'we've got in the forefront of our mind these women and girls, the ones that are in America', and they were saying, but what about us? What about your own Epstein, which is al Fayed?\" There also needs to be \"a total feminist reset of Number 10\", and a female first secretary of state (most senior cabinet minister below the prime minister) to \"drive forward culture change across government\", Baroness Harman concluded."

        "Content": "By home news correspondent, Mollie Malone, and long form producer, Nina Saada  Ministers have so far been unable to strip Wayne Couzens, the former police officer who raped and murdered Sarah Everard, of his public sector pension and are considering introducing legislation if required, Sky News can reveal. In March 2021, when he was a serving Metropolitan Police officer, Couzens used his police warrant to lure Sarah Everard into a fake arrest while she was walking home from a friend's house in south London, during the COVID-19 pandemic. He later raped and murdered her. In 2023, London's mayor Sadiq Khan successfully applied to the home secretary to have any money that Couzens could have earned in pension payments while serving at the Met forfeited. It's understood to be so small that it would be a negligible amount because of the short length of service there. Mr Khan, who is also the city's police and crime commissioner, at the time also believed Couzens had \"approximately seven years' pension service\" with the Civil Nuclear Constabulary (CNC), between 2011 and 2018, according to a letter shared with Sky News. This is a special force which guards nuclear facilities and is the ultimate responsibility of the energy secretary. It is not like other forces, which fall under the home secretary. \n                  Sarah Everard's mother 'tormented' by her last hours as Angiolini women's safety report is released\n                 \n                  Former Metropolitan Police officers who shared 'offensive' messages in chat with Wayne Couzens lose appeal against convictions\n                 \n                  700 investigations launched after calls to Met Police anti-corruption service as national hotline goes live\n                 In a letter from 2023 to the then energy secretary, Grant Shapps, and shared with Sky News, Mr Khan said the CNC portion of Couzens' pension \"sits outside the normal police pension regulations\". Freedom of information data obtained by Sky News shows there were no pension forfeitures from the Civil Nuclear Constabulary between 2020 and September 2025. It is understood that remains the case. A Department for Energy Security and Net Zero spokesperson told Sky News they are \"absolutely determined that Wayne Couzens does not receive a Civil Nuclear Constabulary pension\". Sky News understands there is an ongoing and complex legal process, and that the government is considering legislation, if required, in order to resolve it. The CNC said when Couzens was convicted, it made a recommendation to the employing force that he should lose his pension benefits, but that it has no decision-making powers. \"After committing such heinous crimes, Wayne Couzens should not receive a penny in taxpayer-funded pension. Londoners would be furious if he did,\" Sadiq Khan told Sky News. \"Every possible step should be taken to ensure that Wayne Couzens does not receive his Civil Nuclear Constabulary pension.\" It is possible for a pension forfeiture to give an individual back the money that they have contributed, while the state retains any money paid in by the police service, funded by the taxpayer. \"When in prison Wayne Couzens' pension would be suspended, but on his death his family could be entitled to up to 50% of his pension,\" Bethan Shellard-Dedman, a lecturer in policing practice, told Sky News. Read more from Sky News:Sarah Everard report 'disturbing'Wayne Couzens: Timeline of killerEverard's mother 'tormented' The requirements for an officer to have their pension forfeited are that they commit an offence against the Official Secrets Act or they are convicted of an offence that is either; \"gravely injurious to the interests of the state\", in connection with their \"service as a member of a police force\" or \"liable to lead to a serious loss of confidence in the public service\". \"If the forfeiture is successful, the individual officer has their contribution returned. The police force would then retain what they contributed. The amounts of which can vary,\" said Ms Shellard-Dedman. \"If you think of that pot as a whole as 100%, what the force contributes is normally around 65%. They can either get the full 65% back or they can get 30% back, in which case the officer would then retain some police pension. But it depends on the individual award.\" Couzens has been convicted of crimes committed in 2021 against Sarah Everard, and indecent exposure offences committed in February 2021 and 2020. These offences were during the period he served at the Metropolitan Police."

        "Content": "Lord Peter Mandelson has been asked to testify to the US Congress over his relationship with the paedophile financier Jeffrey Epstein. A letter from two Democrat members of the House of Representatives called on the former British ambassador to Washington to answer questions from the House Oversight Committee as part of their probe into Epstein. The disgraced peer's links with Epstein have led to calls for Sir Keir Starmer to stand down as prime minister. The prime minister's judgement has been questioned by critics over his appointment of Lord Mandelson as US ambassador, a role considered the most prestigious posting in British diplomacy. The letter to Lord Mandelson, signed by representatives Robert Garcia and Suhas Subramanyam, said: \"While you no longer serve as British ambassador to the United States and have stepped down from the House of Lords, it is clear that you possessed extensive social and business ties to Jeffrey Epstein and hold critical information pertaining to our investigation of Epstein's operations. \"Given the appalling allegations regarding Epstein's conduct, we request that you make yourself available for a transcribed interview with Committee staff regarding the crimes of Jeffrey Epstein and his co-conspirators.\" The letter added: \"Numerous pieces of evidence have come to light demonstrating your close ties to Jeffrey Epstein over the span of multiple years.\" Among the evidence, it listed Lord Mandelson's \"handwritten note\" in a 50th birthday book for Epstein in which he described him as his \"best pal\". It also highlighted the peer's stay at Epstein's New York apartment in 2009 while Epstein was serving an 18-month sentence for soliciting prostitution and soliciting a minor. Also cited were photographs of Lord Mandelson in his underwear in the latest Department of Justice release from the Epstein files. The letter gave Lord Mandelson a deadline of 27 February to respond to the two US politicians \"due to the urgency and gravity of this matter\".

        "Content": "\n          Science and technology editor\n              @t0mclark3\n More than 10 years ago, I filmed my kids for a report on the impact of screens on young minds. My eldest daughter was six at the time, her twin sisters nearly three. They didn't have their own devices - Instagram, Snapchat and YouTube were beyond their imagination. TikTok hadn't even been invented. Yet now as teenagers their lives, like pretty much every other child we know, are dominated by social media. Snapchat is central to their social lives and TikTok is a go-to dopamine fix. As parents we try our best to pry the devices out of their hands and limit their screen time. No surprise the idea of a government-mandated ban is popular with parents, less so with kids. \"We've been born into a world with social media so it's a bit unfair if you just take it away from people who are younger,\" said one of my 13-year-olds. Especially, she adds, \"when they're influenced by adults who are also on their phones.\" Fair point. But we've just about had enough of arguing with them about it. \n                  Instagram use can be 'problematic' but not addictive, says app's chief\n                 \n                  Beth Rigby: The constant challenges I face keeping my kids safe in the new Wild West\n                 \n                  Instagram and YouTube 'engineer addiction' in young people, landmark trial hears\n                 Now it looks like we've reached a point where the majority of people are starting to think the same. France and Spain are promising laws to ban child access to social media as early as this year. Austria, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, Greece, Italy and Slovenia have proposed similar legislation. Read more:The challenges I face keeping my kids safe in the new Wild WestDo you know what your kids see online?Instagram and YouTube 'engineer addiction' Portugal is considering parental consent for child social media access. Last month the Westminster government said it would consult on the issue of social media for the under-16s. As a bloc, the EU has said it supports a Europe-wide ban. A tipping point? So, have we finally reached a tipping point where social media companies will be forced to amend their products? \"We knew cigarettes were harmful and addictive and kill people for decades before we actually got legislation that made a difference,\" said Clare Melford, chief executive of the Global Disinformation Index. \"Social-media companies have only been around for 15, 20 years. So it is relatively quick on a historical scale, but for those of us who have teenagers now, it's not quick enough.\" White House backs Big Tech A Big Tech-backing White House isn't helping. US secretary of state Marco Rubio in December banned Ms Melford and three other European online safety campaigners from entering the US. Another, a legal resident in New York, was threatened with deportation. \"I wasn't surprised because we know the impact of Big Tech and big money on government in America and around the world,\" said Imran Ahmed, the British boss of US-based Centre for Countering Digital Hate (CCDH). \"But of course, it was shocking as a family to be threatened with potential detention just for the things I said.\" Tech bros fight back The tech bros are fighting back too. Elon Musk has been a target of European ire over allegedly extremist content on his platform and his Grok AI's (now curtailed) \"nudification\" powers. When Spain's Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez announced his social media ban earlier this month, Musk hit out. \"Dirty Sanchez,\" he posted on X, the platform he owns. It is Mr Sanchez, not he, who is \"the true fascist totalitarian\" as well as \"a tyrant and traitor to the people of Spain\". But it would be wrong to think the White House and social media firms are in step with wider US public opinion. US states back child social media bans American parents are angry too and their elected representatives know it. US states, like Mr Rubio's Florida, have backed child social media bans. Regulations to protect kids online are gaining traction and rare bipartisan support in Congress. In the absence of hope for federal restrictions, court cases, like one under way in California this week, centring on the \"addictiveness\" of apps, are also putting pressure on social media platforms. If successful, it may even force them to amend their offerings to children. \"From my perspective... we are further along in that battle than we ever have been,\" said Mr Ahmed from the CCDH. \"I think that ultimately we will be able to renegotiate the toxic relationship that we have with tech, where they are exploiting rather than enriching our kids.\" It now looks like public opinion will ultimately force Big Tech to make social media a safer, better place for children. But given the industry's deep pockets and influence, I'm expecting to be arguing with my kids about their screens for a while yet."

The 48-year-old actor died on Wednesday, after being diagnosed with bowel cancer in 2023. He rose to fame playing Dawson Leery in the popular US drama Dawson's Creek, which ran from 1998 to 2003, and followed a group of high school friends and the highs and lows of their friendships and romances. High-profile names, including director Steven Spielberg and actress Zoe Saldana, were among those who donated to the fundraiser set up to assist Van Der Beek's wife and six children. Spielberg and his wife Kate Capshaw made a one-off donation of $25,000 (£18,000). While Van Der Beek and Spielberg never worked together, the actor's character in Dawson's Creek famously idolised the director and had posters of his movies up on his bedroom wall. Guardians Of The Galaxy star Saldana pledged $2,500 (£1,800) a month, while Crazy Rich Asians director Jon M Chu pledged $10,000 (£7,300), as did talent manager Guy Oseary. The GoFundMe campaign, set up by friends of the Van Der Beek family to support Van Der Beek's wife, Kimberly, posted a thank you message which read: \"Thank you from the bottom of our hearts for showing up for James and his beautiful family. Your kindness has meant more than we can put into words. \n                  Nancy Guthrie: What we know about mysterious disappearance of TV host's mother\n                 \n                  Blake Lively and Justin Baldoni appear in court together for first time in legal showdown\n                 \n                  Trial date set for Trump's $10bn lawsuit against BBC over Panorama edit\n                 \"In the middle of deep grief, your support has been a light. It reminds us that love is real, that community is strong, and that James's spirit continues to bring people together.\" The GoFundMe page, which featured photos of Van Der Beek and his family, explained that the actor's family faced \"not only emotional challenges but also significant financial strain\" during his illness. It said: \"In the wake of this loss, Kimberly and the children are facing an uncertain future. \"The costs of James's medical care and the extended fight against cancer have left the family out of funds. \"They are working hard to stay in their home and to ensure the children can continue their education and maintain some stability during this incredibly difficult time.\" It said donations would go towards essential living expenses and the support of his children's education. Sharing 'adventures of a unique youth' On Tuesday, Katie Holmes, who starred opposite Van Der Beek in Dawson's Creek, paid tribute to his \"bravery\" and \"selflessness,\" posting a handwritten letter on Instagram. She said they had shared \"laughter\", \"conversations about life\", and \"adventures of a unique youth\". Alongside Van Der Beek and Holmes, Michelle Williams and Joshua Jackson made up the core cast of four, playing Jen Lindley and Pacey Witter, respectively. Dawson's Creek actors Busy Philipps, Kerr Smith and Mary-Margaret Humes, as well as the show's creator Kevin Williamson, were also among those who paid their respects. Actress Heather McComb, who was married to Van Der Beek between 2003 and 2010, said she was \"heartbroken\" at the news of his death. 'What a journey' \"I am especially heartbroken for his incredible wife Kimberly, his beautiful children and his amazing family, Jim, Jared, Juliana and all of his family and friends who I know he loved deeply,\" she captioned an Instagram photo of the pair at her 21st birthday. She added: \"What a journey we shared over the years. I sit here in immense gratitude for the special connection, friendship and love that James and I shared that has endured through decades. \"I will treasure the last loving words we exchanged. James was a beautiful soul filled with so much light, love, talent, humor, depth, sensitivity, knowledge and a deep love of God that shined through him.\" Van Der Beek remarried to wife, Kimberly, in 2010. His film credits include the 1999 cult classic Varsity Blues, Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back, The Big Bang and Labor Day. Van Der Beek also starred in the film Varsity Blues, in which he played Jonathan \"Mox\" Moxon, the backup quarterback of a high school football team, and played a parody version of himself in the sitcom Don't Trust the B**** in Apartment 23."
