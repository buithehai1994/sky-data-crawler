        "Content": "\n          Asia correspondent\n              @HelenAnnSmith0\n At a critical port on the Taiwanese island of Penghu, there is a sudden bang of explosions. For emergency crews, it is a race to respond, attend to the injured and contain what damage they can. It is noisy and chaotic. But this time, it is just a rehearsal.  In fact, what we have been invited to watch is part of a programme of nationwide drills to test Taiwan's civil resilience. To ask, in essence, if its people are ready for war. And there are clearly questions here about whether they are. Penghu is an archipelago that sits about 31 miles (50km) west of Taiwan's main island. It could be an early, easy target for China - and that means preparation here is vital. But observers who have travelled from Taipei to assess proceedings are not entirely impressed. \"Do you think with just the staff here now it will be enough?\" asks one senior government official at a community hall where about a dozen staff are practising handing out food and supplies. \"Of course not! There will be more than 7,000 people queuing up. They'll wait from morning until the afternoon and get nothing. It's completely impossible.\" 'China is preparing to invade' The scenarios might be imagined, but the threat behind them is very real, and it's being met with a new sense of urgency. And now, in an interview with Sky News, Taiwan's deputy foreign minister Wu Chihchung lays out the reality in perhaps some of the starkest terms used by this administration to date. \"The population need to not be naive like in the past,\" he says. \"China is preparing to invade Taiwan.\" It comes at a time when increasingly sophisticated military activity and grey zone incursions from China have combined with a more robust approach from Taiwan's new president Lai Ching-te, resulting in the most febrile atmosphere in the Taiwan Strait for decades. Add into the mix Donald Trump's presidency casting doubt over whether Taiwan can rely on US support in the event of a crisis, and questions about Taiwan's readiness feel more pressing now than ever before. \"Taiwan alone, facing China - we will never be ready,\" concedes Wu. \"It's not possible, China is so big, so huge.\" His words reflect harsh realities in Taiwan. Self-governing and democratic, it is viewed by China as a breakaway province. Under President Xi Jinping, the long-held aim of reunification has been turbocharged - he has reportedly asked his troops to be ready for a potential invasion as early as 2027. Meanwhile, Taiwan's new president is seen as a deeply provocative figure on the mainland, with Beijing depicting him in propaganda as a parasite \"courting ultimate destruction\". In Lai Ching-te's first year in office, he has demonstrated a willingness to go further in both words and policies than any who have preceded him. He has not only described China as \"a foreign hostile force\" but has introduced a raft of new security measures, including the reinstating of a military court-style system, the deportation of pro-China influencers and a spike in the number of people arrested for espionage - four times as many last year as in 2021. And all this has not gone unnoticed by China. China's grey zone tactics The 14 months since Lai's inauguration have been marked by an increase in Chinese action: numerous large-scale military drills, live-fire exercises and full encirclement of the island by jets and ships. Beijing also appears to have been testing new capabilities, with onlookers in China taking videos of what appeared to be a test of a huge amphibious bridging system, a possible path on to Taiwan. But perhaps the most noteworthy change has been the marked increase in so-called grey zone incursions, with China encroaching slowly in ways that are hard for Taiwan to respond to. On Penghu, these tactics are a daily reality and are impacting lives and livelihoods. \"In the past, our fishing boats could go directly to mainland China. They'd even go ashore, maybe grab a meal,\" explains Yen Te-Fu, who heads up the Penghu Fishermen's Association. \"But fishermen are now too afraid to sail to China. When they fish in our own waters, they constantly see Chinese Coast Guard ships. They're genuinely scared.\" He says it's worse now than ever \"because Lai Ching-te's stance is even clearer\". But the use of coastguard vessels to enforce new Chinese-set norms is just one tactic, according to observers. Research published by the Taiwanese thinktank Research Project on China's Defence Affairs (RCDA) has recorded new incidents of so-called \"three-no\" ships crossing the median line. These are ships with no name, no registered home port and no registration certificate. Thirty ships crossed on the eve of the one-year anniversary of President Lai's inauguration as an \"evidently disguised maritime militia ship\", the RCDA says. While not against maritime law, it is nonetheless a serious accusation. \"This is nothing but a sheer slander, like a thief shouting 'catch the thief',\" said Senior Colonel Zhang Xiaogang, a spokesperson for China's ministry of national defence, when we put it to him. \"The relevant actions conducted by the PLA in the Taiwan Strait are necessary measures to safeguard national sovereignty and territorial integrity.\" Transactional Trump 'constantly changing' Conversations about Taiwan's security have changed since Donald Trump returned to the White House. Like most countries, the US does not share formal diplomatic relations with Taiwan, but it is treaty-bound to supply it with defensive arms, and previous presidents have hinted they would do more if needed. But Trump has accused Taiwan of \"stealing\" the US semiconductor industry, slapped it with a 32% tariff rate and refused to say if he would come to Taiwan's defence (the tariff has been paused while negotiations continue). At a baseball game in the northern city of Taoyuan, people didn't hold back their views. \"I think he's quite crazy,\" one woman tells us. \"He's constantly changing, there's no credibility at all,\" says a man. \"It's always America First, not caring about any other country.\" Government figures, of course, remain more diplomatic. Lai described the recent tariff negotiation as merely \"frictions between friends\", but there is a sense that they know they cannot afford to become alienated from Trump. In fact, TSMC, Taiwan's (and the world's) leading manufacturer of semiconductor chips, recently announced an additional $100bn investment to build factories in the US. Semiconductors are the vital chips needed to power the modern world. Taiwan makes more than 90% of the world's most advanced ones, and the industry is seen as one of the key reasons the West could come to its support. The US investment was thus criticised by some as a divergence of Taiwan's greatest defensive asset, a claim the government here bats away. \"America has also given us a lot,\" insists deputy foreign minister Wu. \"The American army is working hard to maintain peace in the region. \"Donald Trump certainly knows that without Taiwanese chips, he cannot make America great again.\" Taiwan's 'wake-up call' on defence With more concern over US support for Taiwan, come questions on whether the island could defend itself. In recent years, there has been a concerted push from the Taiwanese government to better equip itself with the type of asymmetric weaponry that would be needed to resist China. Inspired by the experiences of Ukraine, additional drone manufacturers were given contracts in 2022 to help rapidly scale up production of military-grade drones. But data from the Research Institute for Democracy, Society and Emerging Technology shows that there is still a long way to go. Drone production capacity in the year to April 2025 was only around 5% of the 180,000 units Taiwan wants to be producing annually by 2028. Thunder Tiger was one of the firms given a contract and its general manager Gene Su says Russia's invasion of Ukraine was a \"wake-up call\" for Taiwanese military procurement. But more needs to be done, he adds. \"I believe we are speeding up, but I believe that it's not yet there,\" he says. In his dealings with the government, he feels that Trump has changed the equation, with an uptick of defence purchasing. But even with these renewed efforts, without help from allies, it is still unlikely Taiwan could hold out. China has always been resolute and consistent. It says the Taiwan question is purely an internal affair of China and that the Lai administration is a separatist force, which is the root cause of disruption to peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait. It also says there is \"no such thing\" as a deputy foreign minister in Taiwan. The status quo has kept Taiwan safe for nearly 80 years and the government here insists that maintaining it is their priority, but that has rarely felt so vulnerable."

At least 145 people were injured, including 14 children, the youngest being a five-month-old girl, Ukraine's Emergency Service said. It was the highest number of children injured in a single attack on Kyiv since the start of Russia's invasion three years ago, according to a count by The Associated Press. A large part of a nine-storey residential building collapsed after it was struck, according to authorities. Rescue teams continue searching for people trapped under the rubble. Yana Zhabborova, 35, who lives in the damaged building, was awakened by loud explosions that shattered the doors and windows of her home. \"There is nothing left,\" said Zhabborova, a mother of a five-month-old baby and a five-year-old child. \"Just stress and shock.\" At least 27 locations across Kyiv were hit by the attack, City Military Administration head Tymur Tkachenko said.

Air defences intercepted and jammed 288 strike drones and three missiles, and five missiles and 21 drones struck targets. Russian troops also struck a residential five-storey building in the eastern Ukrainian city of Kramatorsk, regional authorities said. One person was killed, and at least 11 more were injured.

Russian and Ukrainian forces have been fighting for control of Chasiv Yar for nearly 18 months, as it features a strategic hilltop that allows troops to launch attacks on other key locations vital to Ukraine's eastern defences. Victor Trehubov, a Ukrainian military spokesperson, has dismissed Russia's claims as \"fabrication,\" saying the situation in the town remains unchanged. However, Ukraine's Army General Staff said in a report on Thursday that there had been seven clashes in Chasiv Yar in the past 24 hours. An attached map showed most of the town under Russian control. DeepState, an open-source Ukrainian map widely used by the military and analysts, showed early on Thursday that neighbourhoods to the south and west of Chasiv Yar remained uncontrolled by either side. New ultimatum for Putin  US President Donald Trump said on Thursday that he was giving Russian President Vladimir Putin a shorter deadline for peace efforts to make progress. Trump said if Putin doesn't agree to a ceasefire by August 8, Washington will impose punitive sanctions and tariffs. \"Both Russia and Ukraine must negotiate a ceasefire and durable peace. It is time to make a deal. President Trump has made clear this must be done by August 8. The United States is prepared to implement additional measures to secure peace,\" senior US diplomat John Kelley told the 15-member UN Security Council on Thursday. Kyiv and Moscow have conducted three rounds of talks in Istanbul this year, resulting in exchanges of prisoners and fallen soldiers, but failing to achieve a significant breakthrough to resolve the ongoing conflict that has lasted over three years. Western leaders have accused the Russian president of dragging his feet in US-led peace efforts in an attempt to capture more Ukrainian land. \"Forcing Moscow to make peace, compelling them to come to a real negotiating table - all the tools needed for this are in the hands of our partners,\" Zelensky said Thursday. \"We are counting on everything now being voiced by America and Europe toward this goal to be fulfilled,\" he added."

        "Content": "\n          Home news correspondent\n              @Mollie_Malone1\n The number of drone incidents in prisons rose by 43% in a year, according to new government data.  In the 12 months to March, there were 1,712 drone incidents at prisons across England and Wales, compared to 1,196 the year before. The latest figures represent \"a new peak\". The ingress of drones into prisons, carrying drugs and weapons, has become an increasing problem for the prison service. In the same dataset, there were over 26,000 incidents of drug finds inside jails, an increase of 25% on the previous year, and more than 13,000 weapons. Earlier this month, the chief inspector of prisons warned that drone technology is becoming so sophisticated that it's a \"theoretical possibility\" that a prisoner could be lifted out of jail by a drone in the near future. In its annual report in July, the prisons watchdog said drones were sending \"overwhelming amounts\" of illicit items into jails, representing a \"threat to national security\". The report reiterated concerns about \"regular deliveries\" into Category A jails in Worcestershire and Manchester, which \"hold the most dangerous men in the country\", including terrorists. Sky News understands the technology allows for drone pilots to be operating the aircraft from abroad, making it difficult for authorities to track them down or make arrests. The Prisons Minister, Lord Timpson, says the government are \"tackling the organised crime gangs behind the drug supply routes\" so that prisons can \"start cutting crime and stop creating better criminals\". It's part of a \"nationwide crackdown on drone drops into prisons\", backed by £900,000 of funding.

Entering the world on 26 July, Thaddeus Daniel Pierce was born from an embryo that had been stored in a tank for just over 30 years, as reported by MIT Technology Review. That embryo was \"adopted\" from the biological mother, who had kept it frozen since 1994, by Lindsey and Tim Pierce, who live in Ohio. It was transferred into Lindsey's uterus in November 2024, who gave birth to baby Thaddeus at the weekend. His adopted dad Tim was just a toddler when the embryo was created, and Thaddeus also has a biological sister who is now 30, with her own 10-year-old daughter. The adoptive mother Lindsey Pierce told Technology Review: \"He is so chill. We are in awe that we have this precious baby.\" It all came about because both the biological mother and the adopting parents were linked up by a Christian \"embryo adoption\" agency. \n                  Scotland approves world's 'biggest offshore windfarm' project - days after Donald Trump pressured First Minister to scrap renewables\n                 \n                  Ofcom launches investigation into new age checks on 34 pornography websites\n                 \n                  'It makes me sad and angry': Bereaved mother urges parents to get their children vaccinated\n                 How the baby was created  As reported by Technology Review, the baby's biological mother and father went through IVF treatment in the 1990s. They created four healthy embryos but the mother, Linda Archerd, had just one of them transferred - who became the now 30-year-old biological sister of Thaddeus. The other three embryos were frozen in the hopes of one day having another baby. But things changed, Linda and her husband separated, and when she reached the menopause she decided to reassess the future of the embryos. Linda, a Christian, decided against donating the embryos to science or giving them to an anonymous couple. Instead, she opted for \"embryo adoption\", which allowed her to have a say in the future parents - with the process overseen by a religious agency. Nightlight Christian Adoptions took on the embryos and placed them with Lindsey and Tim Pierce. They fitted Linda's criteria of a married, Caucasian Christian couple, and went on to have Thaddeus - giving him a biblical name. One of the embryos stopped growing, two were transferred Lindsey's uterus, and one developed into a foetus. After Thaddeus was born, Linda, now 62, told Technology Review that he resembles his big sister. \"The first thing that I noticed when Lindsey sent me his pictures is how much he looks like my daughter when she was a baby.\" Christian embryo adoption agencies Before Thaddeus, other babies had been born from embryos 27 and 30 years old. But such cases are rare because few organisations are willing to take on old embryos, concerned about the time and manner in which they have been stored. The IVF doctor who looked after the Pierces, John Gordon, also a Christian, set up the Rejoice Fertility Clinic to reduce the number of embryos held in storage. Millions of embryos are estimated to be stored in freezers around the world, leftover from IVF procedures, which often yield more than can be implanted."

However, she said work carried out by the Wealth Tax Commission in 2020 had looked at various types of international wealth taxes and how it would be possible to deliver one in a UK context.  She added: \"I would hope the Treasury is considering that kind of evidence, as well as other changes that have been put forward.\" \n                  What happened when I quit the government \n                 \n                  Why aren’t parents getting their children vaccinated?\n                 \n                  Are Trump's tariffs destroying lives and livelihoods in Lesotho?\n                 The former cabinet minister also said that tax proposals outlined by Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner to Rachel Reeves should be \"considered\". In a memo that was leaked to the Daily Telegraph in May, Ms Rayner suggested to the chancellor that she increase taxes, including reinstating the pensions lifetime allowance and a higher corporation tax level for banks. \"We've seen the deputy leader of the Labour Party, for example, put forward suggestions as I understand it,\" Ms Dodds said. \"I think it's important for all of those to be considered now.\" Ministers have signalled they will not bring in a wealth tax to balance the books, with Business Secretary Jonathan Reynolds branding the suggestion \"daft\". Read more:Sir Keir Starmer's significant breakthrough Gary Neville hits out at national insurance rise Speaking to GB News last week, Mr Reynolds said: \"This Labour government has increased taxes on wealth as opposed to income - the taxes on private jets, private schools, changes through inheritance tax, capital gains tax. \"But the idea there's a magic wealth tax, some sort of levy...that doesn't exist anywhere in the world. \"Switzerland has a levy, but they don't have capital gains or inheritance tax. There's no kind of magic. We're not going to do anything daft like that. \"And I say to people: 'Be serious about this.' The idea you can just levy everyone. What if your wealth was not in your bank account, what if it was in fine wine or art? How would we tax that? This is why this doesn't exist. \"There's a lot of populism out about this, and I'm frustrated. I see colleagues sometimes say this in parliament and I say: 'Come on, get serious.'\" Ms Dodds said that while she had not spoken directly with Ms Reeves about a wealth tax, she believed the \"trade-off we have to consider in a world of lots of difficult trade-offs is potentially making some big and significant changes early, or having to make many tactical changes through the parliament and potentially being forced into some of those difficult decisions anyway later on\"."

        "Content": "\n          Home news correspondent\n              @Mollie_Malone1\n The number of drone incidents in prisons rose by 43% in a year, according to new government data.  In the 12 months to March, there were 1,712 drone incidents at prisons across England and Wales, compared to 1,196 the year before. The latest figures represent \"a new peak\". The ingress of drones into prisons, carrying drugs and weapons, has become an increasing problem for the prison service. In the same dataset, there were over 26,000 incidents of drug finds inside jails, an increase of 25% on the previous year, and more than 13,000 weapons. Earlier this month, the chief inspector of prisons warned that drone technology is becoming so sophisticated that it's a \"theoretical possibility\" that a prisoner could be lifted out of jail by a drone in the near future. In its annual report in July, the prisons watchdog said drones were sending \"overwhelming amounts\" of illicit items into jails, representing a \"threat to national security\". The report reiterated concerns about \"regular deliveries\" into Category A jails in Worcestershire and Manchester, which \"hold the most dangerous men in the country\", including terrorists. Sky News understands the technology allows for drone pilots to be operating the aircraft from abroad, making it difficult for authorities to track them down or make arrests. The Prisons Minister, Lord Timpson, says the government are \"tackling the organised crime gangs behind the drug supply routes\" so that prisons can \"start cutting crime and stop creating better criminals\". It's part of a \"nationwide crackdown on drone drops into prisons\", backed by £900,000 of funding.

        "Content": "\n          Health correspondent\n              @ashishskynews\n  The mother of a five-year-old boy who died after being sent home from hospital because of a \"lack of beds\" has told Sky News that the second report into his death \"has not brought closure for the family\".  Yusuf Nazir died in November 2022. His mother Soniya had rushed her son to Rotherham Hospital's A&E, only to be told \"there were no beds available\". Yusuf was eventually seen by a doctor but then sent home. Soniya says the doctor told her that \"Yusuf had the worst case of tonsillitis he had ever seen\". But the child's health continued to deteriorate, and his desperately worried mother called an ambulance to rush him to the nearby specialist children's hospital in Sheffield. It was here, the report says, that a number of critical interventions were missed. Yusuf's family say that, if doctors had acted sooner, he would still be alive. Speaking in her first interview since Yusuf's death, Soniya described the panic she felt as a mother watching her son \"dying in front of her eyes\". \"I carried Yusuf to the nurse, floppy with his eyes rolled back, struggling to breathe, myself to the nurse,\" Soniya said. \n                  Conservatives vow to ban doctor strikes - as Kemi Badenoch hits out at 'militant' union\n                 \n                  Impact of long NHS waits on patients revealed, plus who waits longest\n                 \n                  Labour doesn't have the one thing striking doctors want \n                 \"She said: 'We're too busy, we can't get a doctor, you'll have to wait.'\" Other patients in the waiting room intervened when they saw Yusuf gasping for air and struggling to breathe, but they were told Yusuf's mother should approach the nurses herself if she was concerned. This second independent report was backed by Wes Streeting when he was shadow health secretary. A previous independent NHS report found no wrongdoing on the part of Rotherham Hospital. The family have described that report as a \"whitewash\". Their claim will be supported by this second report, which says: \"It's clear that across all settings - primary care, pre-hospital, emergency and inpatient - the healthcare system failed to truly hear the family's voice.\" It also says staff should have listened to the \"mother's instinct\". \"I knew he was very, very poorly, he was struggling to breath, he was lethargic, he was floppy,\" Soniya told Sky News. \"I knew that something's not right before they even escalated it to the ICU. I knew he was very poorly but no one else picked it up.\" The health secretary told Sky News: \"There are no excuses for the tragic failings in the lead up to Yusuf's death, and I know first-hand how hard it has been for his family to live without the answers they deserve. \"This independent report reveals their concerns were repeatedly not addressed across NHS services. \"It is now the responsibility of the NHS to implement the recommendations in this report so that the family can at least take small comfort in knowing that because of Yusuf - and thanks to Yusuf - children will be safer and better cared for in the future, but I know that really is of no consolation for a loving family living with the unimaginable pain of losing a lovely little boy in these awful circumstances.\" Part of the report's key findings shows Yusuf had 23 separate healthcare contacts across four NHS organisations that were responsible for his care, but there was no coordinated record or oversight. It found the clinical assessments that were made were inconsistent and led to difficulties in comparing his condition over time. Routine care prior to his crisis was marked by a wait-and-see approach that failed to pre-empt worsening conditions. It also recorded clinical staff at Sheffield used an outdated cannula method that failed to give Yusuf potentially life-saving drugs. Soniya says she pointed out the leaking cannula to Yusuf's nurses, but her concerns were brushed aside. \"The cannula burst and the whole bed was full of his medication and blood on the morning he went to the ICU, the whole weekend he'd not had that medication,\" she said. \"He'd have been in pain and he wouldn't have been getting any better if he wasn't having the medication. And I think that's the reason Yusuf's not here anymore. \"From the moment he was in Sheffield Children's Hospital until the end I think he didn't get any treatment, it was just like him being at home.\" Soniya says she welcomes the report's findings that show Yusuf did not get the care he needed - but the investigation does not find a cause of death or apportion blame. Speaking at a news conference after the report was published, Soniya said her concerns \"were ignored each and every time\" and \"my son was left to die right beside me\". She said: \"The report concludes [there were] 13 missed opportunities to escalate Yusuf's care, all while I was trusting the NHS to protect him. They failed him catastrophically. Why was my son treated like a number on a list and not a living, breathing child desperate for help? \"My son went into hospital with tonsillitis and he never returned home.\" She added: \"For us, Yusuf has been taken away in the most horrific way. \"Every night when I close my eyes, I hear Yusuf's helpless voice in my ears saying: 'Mummy, I can't breathe, I can't breathe, I really can't,' and the image of him being handed over to me after his life ended, as though someone had torn my heart out and placed it in my hands.\" Yusuf's uncle, Zaheer Ahmed, said the family want an inquest to find out Yusuf's cause of death. He said: \"Despite all these failings, despite all these issues that we've had, we still do not know how Yusuf has died. We want answers. We want an inquest. An inquest will tell us how Yusuf has died. And this is what the family are demanding.\" The investigation has made national recommendations, including consultant-led oversight on weekends and giving parents visibility of their child's medical records. Sky News has closely followed the family's fight for answers since first reporting on Yusuf's case, two days after he died.  Dr Jeff Perring, executive medical director at Sheffield Children's NHS Foundation Trust, said: \"We recognise the profound loss felt by Yusuf's family and those who loved him. \"We will be reviewing the recommendations of the report and taking those forward through education, guidance, policy and training to deliver the best care for our children, young people and families.\" \"We want change,\" Soniya says. \"We want this not to happen to any other child. Because if they don't change, there's going to be another child and another mother sat here telling you the same story.\" Dr Jo Beahan, medical director at The Rotherham NHS Foundation Trust, said: \"Our deepest sympathies remain with Yusuf's family following such a sad loss of a loved family member. \"Since November 2022, we have taken steps to address the concern relating to Yusuf's care which includes listening to the concerns of parents and carers. Our thoughts continue to be with Yusuf's family.\" Professor Aidan Fowler, national director of patient safety in England, said: \"Our sympathies remain with Yusuf's family, and we acknowledge the heavy toll this investigation has placed on them - while grieving an unimaginable loss. \"Following publication of the final report today, we will respond on the findings and how we will be taking forward the recommendations in the report to ensure there are continuing improvements in patient safety and care for children across NHS hospitals and services in the future.\" Read more from Ashish Joshi:The biggest challenge facing Streeting over scandalous state of maternity servicesFamily's agony after actress died following 'physician associate' misdiagnosis  The Nazir family's fight is not over. This report cannot confirm Yusuf's cause of death, or say if his life could have been saved with better care. It is why Soniya is demanding a coroner's inquest into her son's death: so that she and her family can finally have closure."

        "Content": "\n          International correspondent\n              @alexrossiSKY\n The UK, France and Canada have drawn a line in the sand and are saying in concert that they will recognise Palestinian statehood in September. Now, unlike in the past, none of these countries really has the power to redraw borders or create new maps. But what they are saying does matter. This is a big deal, and it adds up to much more than simple virtue signalling. Follow the latest on the war in Gaza For one, these recognitions are coming from three of the West's most powerful and established democracies. And the symbolism is also not lost on anyone. \n                  US officials to make 'highly unusual' visit to Gaza - amid warnings of 'politically manmade' famine\n                 \n                  US doctor in Gaza asks Trump's envoy to come and see reality on ground\n                 \n                  Minister rejects claim that recognition of Palestine state could breach international law\n                  France and Britain, as the old colonial cartographers, literally drew the map of the modern Middle East. This is, in its own way, an admission that what has happened to the Palestinian people has been a profound injustice. So now we have a situation where a strong pillar of the Western alliance is about to start treating Palestine as a real country. And that has serious implications. Recognition from traditionally pro-Israel Western democracies suggests growing disillusionment with Israeli policies. It also gives the Palestinians far greater legitimacy, which can carry real weight in international law and in institutions like the United Nations and the International Criminal Court. It's also a signal - and one that Israel will be, or should be, deeply concerned about. Read more:Gaza's deadliest days linked by a pattern of attacks on familiesRecognising Palestine 'won't break law' - watch The government of Benjamin Netanyahu is edging the country toward dangerous territory. If it continues down its current path, it risks falling into a deepening state of diplomatic isolation. Now, critics will say - none of this really matters while Donald Trump is in the White House.  They'll argue that only the United States has the leverage to force real change. That if Washington cuts aid or tells Netanyahu, in a loud Trumpian voice, that enough is enough, the impact would be immediate. And they'd be right - to a point. Israeli policy is still largely shaped by the United States. As long as Washington provides political and military backing, symbolic gestures from Europe and Canada have limited practical effect. And then there's the reality on the ground. Settlements, military control of the West Bank, and the war in Gaza will not be undone by diplomatic recognition. Israel has also weathered similar storms before. More than 140 countries already recognise Palestine. It hasn't stopped expansion in the occupied territories or curtailed Israeli military operations. But that doesn't mean this new diplomatic front led by the UK, France and Canada won't have an impact. It won't change things overnight. In the short term, it may even deepen Israeli defiance. But it does mark a significant shift in the global mood. And if Netanyahu has a dashboard in his residence, this moment should be flashing red."

The US president branded the turbines a \"con-job\" and described those along Scotland's coastline as \"some of the ugliest you've ever seen\". Mr Trump raised the issue during face-to-face talks with Scottish First Minister John Swinney on the president's visit to Aberdeenshire on Tuesday.  The lobbying by Trump appears to have failed because, as of Thursday morning, the Scottish Government issued licences for the Berwick Bank project in the waters off the Scottish Borders. SSE, the developer, has described the project as the largest in the world, with the possibility of powering six million homes when complete. Mr Trump said at the weekend that offshore wind is \"ruining\" Scotland and Europe, and claimed it is \"killing the birds\". John Swinney told Sky News following the summit with the US president that \"we are not going to be able to agree on all subjects and I am a believer in climate change\". Announcing approval on Thursday, the Scottish Government said that Berwick Bank could generate enough electricity each year to power every household in Scotland around twice over. Scottish Secretary Ian Murray said: \"These large-scale renewable energy projects will ensure people in Scotland truly benefit from clean power, lower bills, and good quality job opportunities.\" Read more from Connor Gillies:Starmer missed a golden opportunity to press POTUSLiving beside the UK's first drug consumption room Stephen Wheeler, managing director of SSE Renewables, added: \"Berwick Bank has the potential to rapidly scale-up Scotland's operational renewable energy capacity and can accelerate the delivery of homegrown, affordable and secure clean energy to UK consumers from Scottish offshore wind, helping meet the UK's clean power ambition by 2030.\" The final plans will need to be approved by Scottish ministers before Berwick Bank proceeds."

        "Content": "West Ham United midfielder Lucas Paqueta has been cleared of spot-fixing following an investigation by the Football Association.  Paqueta, 27, was charged with four alleged breaches involving Premier League fixtures between November 2022 and August 2023. The Brazil international, who had been under investigation since August 2023, denied attempting to influence matches \"by intentionally seeking to receive a card from the referee for the improper purpose of affecting the betting market\". An independent regulatory commission found the charges not proven following a hearing. The FA said two charges against Paqueta, which the player denied, related to a failure to co-operate with its investigation had been found proven. An FA statement said: \"The commission will decide an appropriate sanction for these breaches at the earliest opportunity.\" In May 2024, Paqueta was charged with spot-fixing at four Premier League matches - against Leicester City in November 2022, Aston Villa in March 2023, Leeds United in May 2023 and Bournemouth in August 2023. \n                  'No one should be subjected to racist abuse,' Meta tells Sky News - five days after England star Jess Carter quit social media\n                 \n                  FA could boycott social media over racism - as it says platforms have 'avoided responsibility' over online abuse\n                 \n                  David Coote: Former Premier League referee charged by FA over Jurgen Klopp comments\n                 Responding to the FA decision in a post on Instagram, Paqueta said: \"Since the first day of this investigation, I have maintained my innocence against these extremely serious accusations\". \"I can't say anything more at this time, but I would like to express how grateful I am to God and how eager I am to return to playing football with a smile on my face. \"To my wife who never let go of my hand, to West Ham United, to the fans who always cheered me on... thank you for everything.\" West Ham's vice-chair Karren Brady said: \"We're pleased Lucas has been cleared. He has maintained his innocence from the outset, and as a club we have resolutely stood by him and supported him throughout the process. \"Despite the incredible pressure on him, Lucas has performed week in and week out for the club, always giving everything. \"It has been a difficult time for Lucas and his family, but he has remained absolutely professional throughout and he is now looking forward to drawing a line under this episode, as is everyone at West Ham.\" Alastair Campbell, a partner at the law firm Level and the head of Paqueta's legal team, said: \"Few cases carry the gravity of this one - professionally, personally and emotionally for our client. \"Lucas has faced down immense pressure with remarkable strength and resilience. \"Level is delighted that we've been able to help demonstrate that Lucas' integrity as a player and a person is in no doubt. \"Now, he can finally get back to focusing on the things that matter most to him - playing football and being with his family.\" The FA said it was awaiting the written reasons from the independent commission in relation to its decision on the charges, and would not be commenting further until that time."

Majd Alshagnobi arrived at London's Heathrow Airport with his mother and two siblings to a hero's welcome on Wednesday evening, with well-wishers bearing flowers, gifts, and banners. It has been a tortuous wait for the teenager, who suffered severe facial injuries in February 2024 when Israeli tank shells exploded near him and a group of friends. Majd lost part of his face as well as his entire jaw and all his teeth. It has left him and his family traumatised. His mother, Islam, told me that doctors at the Mamadani hospital in Gaza were shocked that her son survived the incident. \"When Majd first got to the hospital, they thought he was dead because of the severities of the injuries on his face and leg,\" she said. \"But when he raised his arm, they realised he was still alive. \"All the operating rooms were busy, so they carried out the operation in the kitchen to save him. \"It was very difficult for him to breathe, and they had to feed him through tubes and syringes through his nose. He really suffered.\"  Majd stood awestruck at the window of the small central London apartment where his family had been accommodated. He wore a blue surgical mask but gently pulled it down to reveal a smile. \"Thank God I have the opportunity to receive treatment here… that's the reason I have come. To get treatment,\" he said. \"Since I arrived, I have felt so much happier. \"We've been greeted in such a nice way, with gifts and things to help us.\" But it will take time for the young football fan to come to terms with the trauma he has suffered. When I ask him what he remembers from his time in Gaza, he replies: \"I saw dogs eating bodies and I was terrified, and I thought I was going to die. Stuff like that…\" His mother, who has had to leave two of her children in Gaza with their father, tells me: \"Right now my family in Gaza live in tents. We've lost our home, we've lost our memories, we've lost our dreams. Nothing is left in Gaza. \"My two children who are still in Gaza with their father, every day I wake up in fear that they have been killed. Anything could happen to them in Gaza.\" Around 5,000 children have been evacuated from Gaza, with the majority going to Egypt and Gulf countries. Majd is the third child to come to the UK with the help of the charity Project Pure Hope. The group of volunteers have been campaigning successive governments for the last 20 months to create a scheme which would allow for the evacuation of 30 to 50 children. The charity has raised the money to bring the children and their families to the UK, and cover their medical costs, privately. Read more:The view from a plane dropping aid to GazaInside Gaza's Nasser Hospital Last week, Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer said the government was \"accelerating efforts\" to evacuate Gazan children who need urgent medical care in the UK. Omar Din, the co-founder of Project Pure Hope, says it is time for the government to step in and take responsibility. \"We're hoping following the prime minister's announcement last Friday, that in the coming days we'll have some concrete actions,\" he said. \"The more we wait, the more children die who we could be saving. \"We've done this privately because there was no other option available but myself, and members of my founding team, have done lots of this work for Ukrainian refugees previously. There's no reason we shouldn't be doing that for Gazans.\" A government spokesperson told Sky News: \"Since the start of the conflict, UK support has helped several children with complex paediatric conditions access privately funded medical care in the UK, under an initiative by Project Pure Hope\"."

Entering the world on 26 July, Thaddeus Daniel Pierce was born from an embryo that had been stored in a tank for just over 30 years, as reported by MIT Technology Review. That embryo was \"adopted\" from the biological mother, who had kept it frozen since 1994, by Lindsey and Tim Pierce, who live in Ohio. It was transferred into Lindsey's uterus in November 2024, who gave birth to baby Thaddeus at the weekend. His adopted dad Tim was just a toddler when the embryo was created, and Thaddeus also has a biological sister who is now 30, with her own 10-year-old daughter. The adoptive mother Lindsey Pierce told Technology Review: \"He is so chill. We are in awe that we have this precious baby.\" It all came about because both the biological mother and the adopting parents were linked up by a Christian \"embryo adoption\" agency. \n                  Scotland approves world's 'biggest offshore windfarm' project - days after Donald Trump pressured First Minister to scrap renewables\n                 \n                  Ofcom launches investigation into new age checks on 34 pornography websites\n                 \n                  'It makes me sad and angry': Bereaved mother urges parents to get their children vaccinated\n                 How the baby was created  As reported by Technology Review, the baby's biological mother and father went through IVF treatment in the 1990s. They created four healthy embryos but the mother, Linda Archerd, had just one of them transferred - who became the now 30-year-old biological sister of Thaddeus. The other three embryos were frozen in the hopes of one day having another baby. But things changed, Linda and her husband separated, and when she reached the menopause she decided to reassess the future of the embryos. Linda, a Christian, decided against donating the embryos to science or giving them to an anonymous couple. Instead, she opted for \"embryo adoption\", which allowed her to have a say in the future parents - with the process overseen by a religious agency. Nightlight Christian Adoptions took on the embryos and placed them with Lindsey and Tim Pierce. They fitted Linda's criteria of a married, Caucasian Christian couple, and went on to have Thaddeus - giving him a biblical name. One of the embryos stopped growing, two were transferred Lindsey's uterus, and one developed into a foetus. After Thaddeus was born, Linda, now 62, told Technology Review that he resembles his big sister. \"The first thing that I noticed when Lindsey sent me his pictures is how much he looks like my daughter when she was a baby.\" Christian embryo adoption agencies Before Thaddeus, other babies had been born from embryos 27 and 30 years old. But such cases are rare because few organisations are willing to take on old embryos, concerned about the time and manner in which they have been stored. The IVF doctor who looked after the Pierces, John Gordon, also a Christian, set up the Rejoice Fertility Clinic to reduce the number of embryos held in storage. Millions of embryos are estimated to be stored in freezers around the world, leftover from IVF procedures, which often yield more than can be implanted."

        "Content": "\n          Asia correspondent\n              @HelenAnnSmith0\n At a critical port on the Taiwanese island of Penghu, there is a sudden bang of explosions. For emergency crews, it is a race to respond, attend to the injured and contain what damage they can. It is noisy and chaotic. But this time, it is just a rehearsal.  In fact, what we have been invited to watch is part of a programme of nationwide drills to test Taiwan's civil resilience. To ask, in essence, if its people are ready for war. And there are clearly questions here about whether they are. Penghu is an archipelago that sits about 31 miles (50km) west of Taiwan's main island. It could be an early, easy target for China - and that means preparation here is vital. But observers who have travelled from Taipei to assess proceedings are not entirely impressed. \"Do you think with just the staff here now it will be enough?\" asks one senior government official at a community hall where about a dozen staff are practising handing out food and supplies. \"Of course not! There will be more than 7,000 people queuing up. They'll wait from morning until the afternoon and get nothing. It's completely impossible.\" 'China is preparing to invade' The scenarios might be imagined, but the threat behind them is very real, and it's being met with a new sense of urgency. And now, in an interview with Sky News, Taiwan's deputy foreign minister Wu Chihchung lays out the reality in perhaps some of the starkest terms used by this administration to date. \"The population need to not be naive like in the past,\" he says. \"China is preparing to invade Taiwan.\" It comes at a time when increasingly sophisticated military activity and grey zone incursions from China have combined with a more robust approach from Taiwan's new president Lai Ching-te, resulting in the most febrile atmosphere in the Taiwan Strait for decades. Add into the mix Donald Trump's presidency casting doubt over whether Taiwan can rely on US support in the event of a crisis, and questions about Taiwan's readiness feel more pressing now than ever before. \"Taiwan alone, facing China - we will never be ready,\" concedes Wu. \"It's not possible, China is so big, so huge.\" His words reflect harsh realities in Taiwan. Self-governing and democratic, it is viewed by China as a breakaway province. Under President Xi Jinping, the long-held aim of reunification has been turbocharged - he has reportedly asked his troops to be ready for a potential invasion as early as 2027. Meanwhile, Taiwan's new president is seen as a deeply provocative figure on the mainland, with Beijing depicting him in propaganda as a parasite \"courting ultimate destruction\". In Lai Ching-te's first year in office, he has demonstrated a willingness to go further in both words and policies than any who have preceded him. He has not only described China as \"a foreign hostile force\" but has introduced a raft of new security measures, including the reinstating of a military court-style system, the deportation of pro-China influencers and a spike in the number of people arrested for espionage - four times as many last year as in 2021. And all this has not gone unnoticed by China. China's grey zone tactics The 14 months since Lai's inauguration have been marked by an increase in Chinese action: numerous large-scale military drills, live-fire exercises and full encirclement of the island by jets and ships. Beijing also appears to have been testing new capabilities, with onlookers in China taking videos of what appeared to be a test of a huge amphibious bridging system, a possible path on to Taiwan. But perhaps the most noteworthy change has been the marked increase in so-called grey zone incursions, with China encroaching slowly in ways that are hard for Taiwan to respond to. On Penghu, these tactics are a daily reality and are impacting lives and livelihoods. \"In the past, our fishing boats could go directly to mainland China. They'd even go ashore, maybe grab a meal,\" explains Yen Te-Fu, who heads up the Penghu Fishermen's Association. \"But fishermen are now too afraid to sail to China. When they fish in our own waters, they constantly see Chinese Coast Guard ships. They're genuinely scared.\" He says it's worse now than ever \"because Lai Ching-te's stance is even clearer\". But the use of coastguard vessels to enforce new Chinese-set norms is just one tactic, according to observers. Research published by the Taiwanese thinktank Research Project on China's Defence Affairs (RCDA) has recorded new incidents of so-called \"three-no\" ships crossing the median line. These are ships with no name, no registered home port and no registration certificate. Thirty ships crossed on the eve of the one-year anniversary of President Lai's inauguration as an \"evidently disguised maritime militia ship\", the RCDA says. While not against maritime law, it is nonetheless a serious accusation. \"This is nothing but a sheer slander, like a thief shouting 'catch the thief',\" said Senior Colonel Zhang Xiaogang, a spokesperson for China's ministry of national defence, when we put it to him. \"The relevant actions conducted by the PLA in the Taiwan Strait are necessary measures to safeguard national sovereignty and territorial integrity.\" Transactional Trump 'constantly changing' Conversations about Taiwan's security have changed since Donald Trump returned to the White House. Like most countries, the US does not share formal diplomatic relations with Taiwan, but it is treaty-bound to supply it with defensive arms, and previous presidents have hinted they would do more if needed. But Trump has accused Taiwan of \"stealing\" the US semiconductor industry, slapped it with a 32% tariff rate and refused to say if he would come to Taiwan's defence (the tariff has been paused while negotiations continue). At a baseball game in the northern city of Taoyuan, people didn't hold back their views. \"I think he's quite crazy,\" one woman tells us. \"He's constantly changing, there's no credibility at all,\" says a man. \"It's always America First, not caring about any other country.\" Government figures, of course, remain more diplomatic. Lai described the recent tariff negotiation as merely \"frictions between friends\", but there is a sense that they know they cannot afford to become alienated from Trump. In fact, TSMC, Taiwan's (and the world's) leading manufacturer of semiconductor chips, recently announced an additional $100bn investment to build factories in the US. Semiconductors are the vital chips needed to power the modern world. Taiwan makes more than 90% of the world's most advanced ones, and the industry is seen as one of the key reasons the West could come to its support. The US investment was thus criticised by some as a divergence of Taiwan's greatest defensive asset, a claim the government here bats away. \"America has also given us a lot,\" insists deputy foreign minister Wu. \"The American army is working hard to maintain peace in the region. \"Donald Trump certainly knows that without Taiwanese chips, he cannot make America great again.\" Taiwan's 'wake-up call' on defence With more concern over US support for Taiwan, come questions on whether the island could defend itself. In recent years, there has been a concerted push from the Taiwanese government to better equip itself with the type of asymmetric weaponry that would be needed to resist China. Inspired by the experiences of Ukraine, additional drone manufacturers were given contracts in 2022 to help rapidly scale up production of military-grade drones. But data from the Research Institute for Democracy, Society and Emerging Technology shows that there is still a long way to go. Drone production capacity in the year to April 2025 was only around 5% of the 180,000 units Taiwan wants to be producing annually by 2028. Thunder Tiger was one of the firms given a contract and its general manager Gene Su says Russia's invasion of Ukraine was a \"wake-up call\" for Taiwanese military procurement. But more needs to be done, he adds. \"I believe we are speeding up, but I believe that it's not yet there,\" he says. In his dealings with the government, he feels that Trump has changed the equation, with an uptick of defence purchasing. But even with these renewed efforts, without help from allies, it is still unlikely Taiwan could hold out. China has always been resolute and consistent. It says the Taiwan question is purely an internal affair of China and that the Lai administration is a separatist force, which is the root cause of disruption to peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait. It also says there is \"no such thing\" as a deputy foreign minister in Taiwan. The status quo has kept Taiwan safe for nearly 80 years and the government here insists that maintaining it is their priority, but that has rarely felt so vulnerable."

In the Volgograd region, some trains were halted after drone wreckage fell on railway infrastructure, state operator Russian Railways said.

Russian and Ukrainian forces have been fighting for control of Chasiv Yar for nearly 18 months, as it features a strategic hilltop that allows troops to launch attacks on other key locations vital to Ukraine's eastern defences. Victor Trehubov, a Ukrainian military spokesperson, has dismissed Russia's claims as \"fabrication,\" saying the situation in the town remains unchanged. However, Ukraine's Army General Staff said in a report on Thursday that there had been seven clashes in Chasiv Yar in the past 24 hours. An attached map showed most of the town under Russian control. DeepState, an open-source Ukrainian map widely used by the military and analysts, showed early on Thursday that neighbourhoods to the south and west of Chasiv Yar remained uncontrolled by either side. New ultimatum for Putin  US President Donald Trump said on Thursday that he was giving Russian President Vladimir Putin a shorter deadline for peace efforts to make progress. Trump said if Putin doesn't agree to a ceasefire by August 8, Washington will impose punitive sanctions and tariffs. \"Both Russia and Ukraine must negotiate a ceasefire and durable peace. It is time to make a deal. President Trump has made clear this must be done by August 8. The United States is prepared to implement additional measures to secure peace,\" senior US diplomat John Kelley told the 15-member UN Security Council on Thursday. Kyiv and Moscow have conducted three rounds of talks in Istanbul this year, resulting in exchanges of prisoners and fallen soldiers, but failing to achieve a significant breakthrough to resolve the ongoing conflict that has lasted over three years. Western leaders have accused the Russian president of dragging his feet in US-led peace efforts in an attempt to capture more Ukrainian land. \"Forcing Moscow to make peace, compelling them to come to a real negotiating table - all the tools needed for this are in the hands of our partners,\" Zelensky said Thursday. \"We are counting on everything now being voiced by America and Europe toward this goal to be fulfilled,\" he added."

Almost 900 migrants (898) were detected crossing the Channel on Wednesday, in 13 boats - bringing the total number of arrivals recorded since 1 January to 25,436.

        "Content": " Conor McGregor has lost his appeal against the finding of a civil jury that he sexually assaulted a woman. Three judges in the Court of Appeal in Dublin rejected all grounds of McGregor's appeal. Dublin's High Court found in November that the MMA fighter was civilly liable for assaulting Nikita Hand in a hotel in the Irish capital in 2018. He was ordered to pay her nearly €250,000 (£215,000) in damages and around €1.3m (£1.1m) in legal costs following the trial. After the verdict, McGregor appealed on the basis of five grounds, one of which involved new evidence that was dramatically withdrawn at a hearing earlier this month. It was an affidavit from a former neighbour of Ms Hand, Samantha O'Reilly, who said she had witnessed a physical row between Ms Hand and her then-partner at about the same time of the incident at the Beacon hotel. McGregor's appeal went forward largely based on the circumstances under which his \"no comment\" answers to gardai (police) were allowed to enter the trial. Reading out the judgment on behalf of the three-judge panel, Mr Justice Brian O'Moore summarised the grounds for appeal before explaining why the Court of Appeal dismissed all five. \"I therefore dismiss the appeal in its entirety,\" he said. Outside court, Ms Hand described the case as a \"long and painful journey\" and said the appeal has \"re-traumatised me over and over again and being forced to relive it had a huge impact on me\". She added: \"To every survivor out there, I know how hard it is but please don't be silenced. You deserve to be heard, you also deserve justice. Today I can finally move on and try to move on.\" Asked if she had any message for McGregor, she said \"no\". Ireland correspondent This was an emphatic rejection of Conor McGregor's legal arguments. Every single ground of his appeal was comprehensively dismissed by the three-judge Court of Appeal in Dublin. As Judge Brian O'Moore delivered their judgement, it was clear they were still baffled by the MMA fighter's abrupt withdrawal of new evidence minutes before the appeal itself got under way.\n This move was made in \"circumstances that remain somewhat mysterious\"  and \"that met with this court's displeasure\". His abandonment of the evidence proved that Nikita Hand's stance – she had said a witness was lying - was \"correct\". One by one, McGregor's arguments were picked apart and dismissed. \"Gossamer-thin\" was one description used by the judge. McGregor himself was nowhere to be seen. Nikita Hand sat in the middle of the bright, airy courtroom, and as we have repeatedly seen in these years-long proceedings, listened impassively as she was vindicated and awarded costs which will prove to be eye-watering. It's unknown if McGregor will further appeal Thursday's decision. He has spent previous days posting extensively about his presidential ambitions and the issue of immigration, months before the Irish presidential election. Today's verdict will undoubtedly prove damaging to any political aspirations he may yet retain. McGregor's co-defendant has also lost his appeal against the trial judge's decision not to award him his legal costs. During the same trial in November, the jury did not find James Lawrence had assaulted Ms Hand at the hotel. However, the trial judge decided that Ms Hand would not have to pay Mr Lawrence's costs. His legal team challenged whether that decision was correct and reasonable, arguing that Ms Hand should have to pay as the jury did not find he had assaulted her. Delivering their judgment on Thursday, the three judges of the court - Ms Justice Isobel Kennedy, Mr Justice Brian O'Moore and Mr Justice Patrick MacGrath - agreed to dismiss both appeals in their entirety. Ms Hand, who was in court, was embraced by her supporters after the judgment was delivered. Neither McGregor nor Mr Lawrence were present in court."

Entering the world on 26 July, Thaddeus Daniel Pierce was born from an embryo that had been stored in a tank for just over 30 years, as reported by MIT Technology Review. That embryo was \"adopted\" from the biological mother, who had kept it frozen since 1994, by Lindsey and Tim Pierce, who live in Ohio. It was transferred into Lindsey's uterus in November 2024, who gave birth to baby Thaddeus at the weekend. His adopted dad Tim was just a toddler when the embryo was created, and Thaddeus also has a biological sister who is now 30, with her own 10-year-old daughter. The adoptive mother Lindsey Pierce told Technology Review: \"He is so chill. We are in awe that we have this precious baby.\" It all came about because both the biological mother and the adopting parents were linked up by a Christian \"embryo adoption\" agency. \n                  Scotland approves world's 'biggest offshore windfarm' project - days after Donald Trump pressured First Minister to scrap renewables\n                 \n                  Ofcom launches investigation into new age checks on 34 pornography websites\n                 \n                  'It makes me sad and angry': Bereaved mother urges parents to get their children vaccinated\n                 How the baby was created  As reported by Technology Review, the baby's biological mother and father went through IVF treatment in the 1990s. They created four healthy embryos but the mother, Linda Archerd, had just one of them transferred - who became the now 30-year-old biological sister of Thaddeus. The other three embryos were frozen in the hopes of one day having another baby. But things changed, Linda and her husband separated, and when she reached the menopause she decided to reassess the future of the embryos. Linda, a Christian, decided against donating the embryos to science or giving them to an anonymous couple. Instead, she opted for \"embryo adoption\", which allowed her to have a say in the future parents - with the process overseen by a religious agency. Nightlight Christian Adoptions took on the embryos and placed them with Lindsey and Tim Pierce. They fitted Linda's criteria of a married, Caucasian Christian couple, and went on to have Thaddeus - giving him a biblical name. One of the embryos stopped growing, two were transferred Lindsey's uterus, and one developed into a foetus. After Thaddeus was born, Linda, now 62, told Technology Review that he resembles his big sister. \"The first thing that I noticed when Lindsey sent me his pictures is how much he looks like my daughter when she was a baby.\" Christian embryo adoption agencies Before Thaddeus, other babies had been born from embryos 27 and 30 years old. But such cases are rare because few organisations are willing to take on old embryos, concerned about the time and manner in which they have been stored. The IVF doctor who looked after the Pierces, John Gordon, also a Christian, set up the Rejoice Fertility Clinic to reduce the number of embryos held in storage. Millions of embryos are estimated to be stored in freezers around the world, leftover from IVF procedures, which often yield more than can be implanted."

Hogan, 71, was pronounced dead in hospital last week, less than 90 minutes after medics arrived at his home in Clearwater, Florida, in response to a call about a \"cardiac arrest\". The report released on Thursday noted his death was from a \"natural\" cause and formally listed as \"acute myocardial infarction\", a technical term for a heart attack. In his honour, Florida governor Ron DeSantis said flags will be flown at half-mast at all official buildings on Friday, which he declared \"Hulk Hogan Day in Florida\".

Hogan was perhaps the biggest star in WWE's long history. He was known for both his larger-than-life personality, including ripping shirts, not just in the ring but also at the Republican National Convention. Hogan was the main draw for the first-ever WrestleMania in 1985 and was a fixture for years in its signature event.  He faced everyone from Andre The Giant and Randy Savage to The Rock and even company chairman Vince McMahon. He claimed his first WWE world championship by defeating the Iron Sheik in 1984. Hogan went on to win five more world championships and was inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame in 2005 by Sylvester Stallone.

Combs, 55, was found guilty of two counts of transportation for engagement in prostitution at the end of his high-profile trial in New York earlier this month - for flying girlfriends and male sex workers around the US and abroad for sexual encounters referred to as \"freak offs\". However, he was cleared of more serious charges of racketeering, conspiracy and sex-trafficking. The hip-hop mogul has been in prison since his arrest in September 2024 and is due to be sentenced in October. On Tuesday, his lawyers made a renewed request for his release on a $50m bond ahead of the hearing. Now, they have filed another motion to the court, saying it \"should either grant a judgment of acquittal or, at a minimum, a new trial\" on the prostitution-related offences. In the new filing, Combs's defence team said the US government had \"painted him as a monster\" ever since his arrest, but argued his two-month trial showed allegations of a \"20-year racketeering enterprise and of sex trafficking multiple women... were not supported by credible evidence, and the jury rejected them\".  They also say that to their knowledge, he is \"the only person\" ever convicted of these charges for the conduct he was accused of in court. \"It is undisputed that he had no commercial motive and that all involved were adults,\" the filing states. \"The men chose to travel and engage in the activity voluntarily.

That is not prostitution, and if it is, his conviction is unconstitutional,\" the filing says. Combs, one of the most influential hip-hop producers of all time, faces being jailed for several years after his conviction on the prostitution-related charges. But he was cleared of the more serious charges that could have put him in prison for life - and the verdict was hailed a \"victory\" by his team. Immediately after he was acquitted of those charges, his lawyers asked for his release on bond. The request was denied by Judge Arun Subramanian, who heard the trial, and said Combs at the time had not met the burden of showing by clear and convincing evidence a \"lack of danger to any person or the community\"."

        "Content": "\n          Business and economics reporter\n              @SkyNewsBiz\n Food inflation will rise to 6% by the end of the year - posing a \"significant challenge\" to household budgets in the run-up to Christmas, industry leaders have predicted. The British Retail Consortium is warning that the chancellor risks \"fanning the flames of inflation\" if she hikes taxes in the coming budget. Despite intense price competition between supermarket chains, the BRC has sounded the alarm over the pace of grocery price hikes. As of this month, food inflation has risen 4% year on year - its highest level since February 2024. The BRC said this increase is linked to global factors, such as high demand and crop struggles. Beef, chicken and tea prices are among those that have risen the most this year - but some of the blame is being laid squarely at the chancellor's door too. The BRC said it was inevitable that a £7bn burden, through changes to employers' national insurance contributions and minimum pay rules after last October's budget, had been partly passed on to customers in the form of higher prices. \n                  Heathrow submits plans for third runway - and says it can be built within a decade \n                 \n                  Money blog: Next sales soar - and it credits unnamed rival for giving it customers (we all know who it is) \n                 \n                  Microsoft is now worth over $4trn, becoming only second firm ever to pass milestone\n                  It published the results of a survey of retail industry finance chiefs to illustrate its point - that nerves about what Ms Reeves's second budget could bring were not helping companies invest in either new employment or prices. Business was promised it would be spared additional pain after it was put on the hook for the bulk of the chancellor's tax-raising measures last year. However, speculation is now rife over who will feel the pain this autumn as she juggles a deterioration in the public finances.  A widening black hole is estimated at around £20bn. The cost of servicing government debt has risen since the last budget, while U-turns on welfare reforms and winter fuel payment cuts have made her job even harder - making further tax-raising measures inevitable. The survey of chief financial officers for the BRC showed the biggest current fear ahead was for the \"tax and regulatory burden\". Two-thirds of the CFOs predicted further price rises in the coming year, at a time when the headline rate inflation already remains stuck way above the Bank of England's target of 2%. It currently stands at 3.6%. Helen Dickinson, chief executive of the BRC, said: \"Retail was squarely in the firing line of the last budget, with the industry hit by £7bn in new costs and taxes. \"Retailers have done everything they can to shield their customers from higher costs, but given their slim margins and the rising cost of employing staff, price rises were inevitable. \"The consequences are now being felt by households as many struggle to cope with the rising cost of their weekly shop. \"It is up to the chancellor to decide whether to fan the flames of inflation, or to support the everyday economy by backing the high street and the local jobs they provide.\" She concluded: \"Retail accounts for 5% of the economy yet currently pays 7.4% of business taxes and a whopping 21% of all business rates. \"It is vital the upcoming reforms offer a meaningful reduction in retailers' rates bill, and ensures no store pays more as a result of the changes.\" The Treasury has been approached for comment.

This week, we speak to Chris Shaw, head chef at Toklas restaurant on the Strand in London...  My favourite restaurant chain is... Pizza Express! I haven't been for a while, but I've got a lot of love for it and so many fond memories there. It's the smell that gets you, of the freshly baked dough balls - so nostalgic. I usually get an American Hot style pizza. It's such a safe haven - it's cheap, cheerful and basically everyone who grew up in London spend their childhood at Pizza Express. My favourite supermarket product is... Maggi liquid seasoning, which you can get from pretty much any major retailer. I put it on everything - some fried rice, a few poached eggs or even in the base of a really good sauce just to lift it a bit. Read all the latest money news My go-to simple recipe to cook at home is... a puttanesca. I always have those ingredients at home, so normally I don't even need to go to the supermarket. You can just raid your cupboard - find a nice tin of anchovies, a jar of capers and some tinned tomatoes. If you've got parmesan rinds left over and some parsley in the fridge, you can bring it all together quite quickly. That's what I tend to eat in when I get back late from work for a snack. My favourite cheap place to eat where I live is... Dom's Subs for a £10 sandwich. I think they've got a few now but I go to the one on Hackney Road. It's such good value, anywhere between £9 and £14, but these things are absolutely massive, filled up right to the brim. I usually get something like The Grapes, a super spicy sub filled with Thai ground chicken, gem lettuce and some of their house-made mayo, then all the pickles, chillies and crispy shallots you need. If I say come round for dinner... I'm the one looking after you and wanting to be hospitable, so if you turn up empty-handed that's all okay with me...

Chiang Mai, Thailand. The food was all cheap and delicious. More than that, there's a shared culture of people who care so deeply about the food they eat and time spent eating together. It's not something you really get in London, but in Chiang Mai all the farmers, school kids and people from the city all sit down together and eat in the same places. One restaurant in the UK that's worth blowing out for is... Trinity in Clapham. One of the best meals I've ever had. Lots of people would agree it should really have two stars. Forget the pressure to pick the right bottle of wine... Explore, ask questions and go with what you like. That's where the good stuff is.

When things opened up after the first lockdown, it was a total reality shock to be doing those hours again and on my feet for so long. It really made me think whether this was the career for me. When you work, work, work and then it all comes to a grinding halt, can you really go back to a 60-hour week? It's a big adjustment and you really have to love this lifestyle. Watching restaurants that I loved close down was also so hard. A classic dish that I don't really like is... smoked salmon and scrambled eggs. I love them individually but not combined. Texturally, I don't think they really go together. Also, toad in the hole is something I could never get on board with. My controversial food opinion is... bacon on burgers is the worst thing in the world. It just doesn't belong in there. I love bacon sandwiches, I'd take one any day of the week. Have a good burger with really good beef, but I don't know why anyone would put bacon in there. Most of the time it's chewy, or absolutely incinerated and the whole thing falls out when you try and eat it. Good-quality beef has enough flavour by itself that you don't need to add the bacon! The best chef in the UK is… Cynthia Shanmugalingam from Rambutan, a Sri Lankan restaurant in Borough Market with a focus on open fire cooking. I'm consistently amazed by what she does and a big fan of the food that comes out of her kitchen."

Sky News has learnt that Klarna and its advisers are aiming to launch an initial public offering (IPO) in September or October if market conditions are conducive. The timing of the IPO is being continuously reviewed, according to insiders, but is likely to take place well before the end of the year.

This week, it said it had been authorised by the City watchdog as an Electronic Money Institution (EMI), allowing it to begin offering cashback to its 11m UK customers later this year. Klarna, which employs about 5,000 people, was founded by chief executive Sebastian Siemiatkowski, who last year also set up a new holding company in Britain. Nevertheless, its impending listing in the US delivered a fresh disappointment to the London Stock Exchange, which had been pushing for it to float in the UK. Klarna has recovered from a torrid period in which it was forced to slash its valuation to $6.7bn (£5.3bn) in a funding round in 2022. It had once been valued at $46bn (£36.6bn) and drawn backing from investors such as SoftBank's Vision Fund, Sequoia Capital and Mubadala, the Abu Dhabi sovereign wealth fund. Klarna declined to comment on the potential timing of a second attempt to go public. John Craske, a spokesman for the company, insisted it was not \"repositioning\" itself as a digital bank because it had \"a full Swedish banking license since 2017\"."

        "Content": "\n          City editor\n              @MarkKleinmanSky\n The owners of the RAC roadside recovery service are preparing to offload the company in a deal which could value it at up to £5bn. Sky News has learnt that CVC Capital Partners, the Singaporean sovereign investment fund GIC and Silver Lake Partners have been in discussions about plans to launch an auction or a stock market listing of the company. The RAC, which was founded in 1897, is one of the world's oldest roadside assistance companies. Money latest: Next benefits from M&S cyberattack disruption It now has about 14 million members, making it nearly as large in customer terms as the AA, its biggest rival. A precise valuation of the business was unclear on Thursday, although insiders said a range of between £4bn and £5bn was reasonable. The AA is also backed by private equity investors who have begun exploring an exit. \n                  Heathrow submits plans for third runway - and says it can be built within a decade \n                 \n                  Money blog: Next sales soar - and it credits unnamed rival for giving it customers (we all know who it is) \n                 \n                  Microsoft is now worth over $4trn, becoming only second firm ever to pass milestone\n                 Sky News revealed earlier this year that Towerbrook Capital Partners, Warburg Pincus and Stonepeak have appointed JP Morgan and Rothschild to conduct a review of the AA's strategic options. The RAC's shareholders are at an earlier stage of deliberations, with investment banks yet to be appointed. People close to the situation said any decision about a transaction would not be made until next year, although it is possible that advisers will be hired in the next few months. The RAC was sold by Aviva, the insurer, to buyout firm Carlyle for £1bn in 2011 in order to focus on its core insurance operations. Carlyle then brought in GIC as a co-investor three years later in a move which derailed plans for a stock market flotation. CVC - a former joint owner of the AA - bought out Carlyle in 2015 through a deal involving its longer-term Strategic Opportunities Fund. Silver Lake, the technology-focused private equity firm, came on board in 2021. The RAC employs thousands of people and is one of Britain's most recognisable consumer brands. It is chaired by the former Debenhams chief Rob Templeman and run by chief executive Dave Hobday. The company's profitability has surged from roughly £170m at the point at which CVC invested to more than £300m. Bankers believe the RAC's owners will be keen to take it public if market conditions allow, but are open to a private sale of the business. The AA has also seen a major improvement in its performance, with it having recorded four consecutive years of customer, revenue and earnings growth. It has also been through a succession of owners during the last 25 years. In 1999, the AA was bought by Centrica, the owner of British Gas, for £1.1bn. It was then sold five years later to CVC and Permira, two buyout firms, for £1.75bn, and sat under the corporate umbrella Acromas alongside Saga for a decade. The AA listed on the London Stock Exchange in 2014, but its shares endured a miserable run, being taken private nearly seven years later at little more than 15% of its value on flotation. None of the parties contacted by Sky News would comment."

The stock was up 11% after it reported figures covering the second quarter that smashed analysts' expectations in almost every metric. The numbers were also seen as justifying chief executive and founder Mark Zuckerberg's huge spending - long a source of frustration for many Meta investors seeking greater rewards in the short term. Money latest: Chain offers free sushi for kids over holidays He told a call with analysts that the company expected to spend up to $72bn (£54bn) this year - and even more in 2026. At the same time, AI rival Microsoft revealed capital expenditure plans that would see its investment surpass $120bn (£90.5bn) if sustained over the year. Meta has been investing in people to power its AI-driven growth and infrastructure to grow advertising sales. Zuckerberg told analysts his pursuit of superintelligence - a hypothetical concept where AI surpasses human intelligence in every possible way - was paying off. In the second quarter, AI-powered ad recommendations drove about 5% more conversions - a purchase or commitment - on Instagram and 3% on Facebook, the company said.

Meta recently introduced an AI-driven image-to-video ad creation tool under its Advantage+ suite, allowing marketers to generate video ads from static images. The company said that, as a result, it was forecasting up to $50bn (£37.7bn) of revenue in the current third quarter of the year - way above the consensus expectation around $46bn (£34.7bn). Commenting on the performance, Matt Britzman, senior equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said: \"Meta has knocked it out of the park. Pick your metric and Meta crushed it, from ad revenue growth to daily users, all the way down to the profit lines. \"AI is clearly delivering real-world benefits for advertisers, and they're willing to pay more as a result. Average price per ad was up 9% over the quarter, a clear indication that Meta is delivering an improved product for both users and advertisers. \"The broader focus now turns to Meta's mammoth AI investment plans and whether it can continue to manage those costs without hurting earnings or free cash flow. \"CFO commentary called out higher costs next year, and another year of similar capex growth, which many analysts did not have on their bingo cards. Clearly, all this spending adds some near-term risks to the bottom line, but Meta looks set to be a clear winner in the AI space over the longer term.\""

        "Content": " A minister has denied claims that Sir Keir Starmer could risk breaching international law with his pledge to recognise Palestine as a state. Nearly 40 members of the House of Lords, including prominent UK lawyers, made the claims in a letter to Attorney General Lord Hermer yesterday. Politics latest: Starmer launches late payment crackdown The letter, first reported by The Times, argues that Sir Keir's promise to recognise Palestine in September - unless Israel takes \"substantive steps\" to end the situation in Gaza - may breach international law as the territory may not meet the criteria for statehood under the Montevideo Convention, a treaty signed in 1933. But speaking to Wilfred Frost on Sky News Breakfast, small business minister Gareth Thomas said he did not believe the move, which has been condemned by Israel, would breach international law because the UK has not signed the Montevideo Convention. He pointed out that 140 countries have already recognised Palestine as a state. Mr Thomas said: \"I respect the views of those lawyers, but in the end, recognition of a state is a political judgement. \"And we've been very clear that our judgement is that the Palestinians have an inalienable right to statehood; that now is the right time to say publicly that we will recognise the state of [Palestine] unless Israel agrees to end the appalling violence that we're seeing in Gaza at the moment, and commits to a two state solution.\" He added: \"And the ceasefire that can enable the huge amounts of aid we need to get aid and to feed the people of Gaza and commits to no annexation of land in the West Bank. Otherwise, we will recognise, at the UN General Assembly in September.\"  Read more:Palestine Action's bid for judicial review granted after MPs banned groupWhat does recognising a Palestinian state mean? Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney yesterday followed in the footsteps of the UK and France, saying his country would also recognise Palestine as a state pending certain conditions - including that the Palestinian Authority commits to fundamentally reforming its governance, and holds general elections in 2026 in which Hamas can play no part. But in their letter to Lord Hermer, 38 peers said Palestine \"does not meet the international law criteria for recognition of a state, namely, defined territory, a permanent population, an effective government and the capacity to enter into relations with other states\". They said there was no certainty over the borders of Palestine and no single government, while also pointing out that Hamas and Fatah are enemies. Lord Hermer has previously insisted that a commitment to international law \"goes absolutely to the heart\" of the government's approach to foreign policy.

Some of Parliament's most prominent Jewish voices, including crossbench peer Baroness Deech, Labour's Lord Winston and the Conservatives' Baroness Altmann, have also put their name to the letter. Israel has condemned the UK's decision, with the foreign ministry arguing it \"constitutes a reward for Hamas and harms efforts to achieve a ceasefire in Gaza and a framework for the release of hostages\". Some of the criticism towards the UK stance has been that conditions have been laid for Israel but not Hamas. Challenged about this, Business Secretary Jonathan Reynolds said the UK does not \"negotiate with terrorists\". Asked whether the government would still recognise Palestine if Hamas does not release any hostages between now and September, he said: \"Our requests that all hostages must be released and that Hamas can play no future role in the governance of Gaza or a Palestinian state are long-standing. \"We don't negotiate with terrorists and Hamas are terrorists, and that's why we don't get into a to-and-fro with them as to what we want them to do. \"What we are seeking to do is use the moment of recognition of a Palestinian State in a way that allows us to genuinely try and move this conflict forward, end it not just in the short term, but for the long term as well.\""

Ms Siddiq resigned earlier this year over accusations she illegally received a plot of land in a new high-end development on the outskirts of Dhaka, Bangladesh's capital, from her aunt, Sheikh Hasina, who was ousted as prime minister last year. Bangladesh's anti-corruption commission (ACC) claims the Labour MP received a 7,200sq ft plot in the diplomatic zone through \"abuse of power and influence\". However, Sky News understands an article published on Thursday morning saying the Labour MP for Hampstead and Highgate will face trial in Bangladesh over the allegations is the first Ms Siddiq had heard of it. A source close to Ms Siddiq told Sky News her lawyer was in court every day last week to request information, but was denied it. The report in the Daily Telegraph said that if the MP refuses to attend court in Bangladesh on 11 August, a trial will be held in her absence.

In a legal letter seen by Sky News in June, the MP also said comments made by Professor Yunus in a Sky News interview have prejudiced her right to a fair investigation, meaning the corruption inquiries should be dropped. The interim leader, who took over after Ms Hasina was ousted last year following violent protests, said Ms Siddiq \"has so many (sic) wealth left behind here\" and \"should be made responsible\". Professor Yunus' press secretary said he and the ACC \"has no reason and scope to interfere in UK politics\". \"The Anti-Corruption Commission relies not on hearsay but on documentary evidence and witness testimony,\" they said."

        "Content": "\n          Chief political correspondent\n              @joncraig\n It wasn't so much a gathering of the Thatcher clan, because there are not many of her cabinet ministers from the 1980s still around these days. But the majority of the Tory grandees who gathered at St Edmundsbury Cathedral in Suffolk for the funeral of her most loyal ally, Norman Tebbit, were indeed Thatcher devotees. Paying tribute to the politician known as \"the first Brexiteer\" and \"the grandfather of Brexit\" were Sir Jacob Rees-Mogg, Mark Francois, former 1922 Committee chairman Lord Graham Brady and Liz Truss's deputy PM Therese Coffey. From the Thatcher years was the novelist and Tory cheerleader Jeffrey Archer with his wife Mary, John Gummer, now Lord Deben, who was Tory chairman in the mid '80s, and the husband and wife political duo Neil and Christine Hamilton. But there was no sign of Lord Tebbit's old foes over Europe, such as Thatcher cabinet big beasts Lord Michael Heseltine or Lord Kenneth Clarke, or Tory leaders with whom he clashed over Europe, such as Sir John Major and Lord David Cameron. Typically, given Lord Tebbit's robustly held, uncompromising beliefs and values, his funeral was a service that was traditional and patriotic. Lady Thatcher would definitely have approved. It began with Elgar's stirring Nimrod from the Enigma Variations and the hymns included the Cup Final anthem Abide with Me and I Vow to Thee, My Country, to the music from Holst's The Planets. \n                  Norman Tebbit: Margaret Thatcher loyalist and IRA bombing survivor forever associated with 'on yer bike' catchphrase\n                 \n                  Starmer's challenge is to see if usual rules of special relationship still apply under Trump after years of love bombing\n                 \n                  Thatcher's Britain? The legacy of the most influential post-war prime minister\n                 Lord Tebbit's successor as MP for Chingford, Sir Iain Duncan Smith, who attended with his wife Betsy, gave the first reading, the scene from Shakespeare's Hamlet in which Laertes says goodbye to his sister Ophelia. When he left the Commons in 1992, Lord Tebbit famously said of his successor, who went on to become Tory leader from 2001 to 2003: \"If you think I'm right-wing, you should meet this guy.\" Read more:Norman Tebbit: Thatcher loyalist and IRA bomb survivor One of Baroness Thatcher's favourite business tycoons, the former P&O boss and major Tory donor Lord Jeffrey Sterling, read The Lord's My Shepherd, before Lord Tebbit's children, William, Alison and John, shared some family reflections. The eulogy was delivered by Lord Michael Dobbs, best known as the author of the 1990s TV political blockbuster House of Cards, but before then an influential Tory insider, working for both Baroness Thatcher and Lord Tebbit. He worked for Baroness Thatcher when she was opposition leader from 1975-79 and was a special adviser to Lord Tebbit at the departments of employment and then trade and trade and industry, and his chief of staff when he was Tory chairman. The service ended with references to Lord Tebbit's early life in the RAF, before he became a commercial pilot, with the Last Post played by an RAF Central Band trumpeter and then the official RAF March. After the service, Lord Dobbs described Lord Tebbit as \"a giant, an inspiring leader\", while Lord Archer said he was \"above all, loyal\", adding: \"Loyalty was his passion.\" Sir Iain said Lord Tebbit was his mentor throughout the early part of his political career and said: \"He was a tough competitor, but the beauty of it that came out was he had a real soft heart and was kind and had many friends on all sides of the House.\" The funeral was followed by a private cremation and friends have told Sky News a memorial service for Lord Tebbit will be held in due course."

Anneliese Dodds, who quit as international development minister in February over Sir Keir Starmer's decision to slash the overseas aid budget, said she believed it was \"important\" that the government considers \"who has the broadest shoulders\". Politics latest: Starmer accused of 'appeasement' by Netanyahu Speaking to Beth Rigby on the Sky News Electoral Dysfunction podcast, Ms Dodds, the MP for Oxford East, said there had been a \"lot of discussion\" about a wealth tax - a direct levy on all, or most of, an individual's, household's or business's total net wealth, rather than their income. Ms Dodds, who also served as shadow chancellor when Labour was in opposition, said she had been \"a bit sceptical about some of those claims for a long time because, of course, wealth is taxed in the UK\". However, she said work carried out by the Wealth Tax Commission in 2020 had looked at various types of international wealth taxes and how it would be possible to deliver one in a UK context.

In a memo that was leaked to the Daily Telegraph in May, Ms Rayner suggested to the chancellor that she increase taxes, including reinstating the pensions lifetime allowance and a higher corporation tax level for banks. \"We've seen the deputy leader of the Labour Party, for example, put forward suggestions as I understand it,\" Ms Dodds said. \"I think it's important for all of those to be considered now.\" Ministers have signalled they will not bring in a wealth tax to balance the books, with Business Secretary Jonathan Reynolds branding the suggestion \"daft\".

There's no kind of magic. We're not going to do anything daft like that. \"And I say to people: 'Be serious about this.' The idea you can just levy everyone. What if your wealth was not in your bank account, what if it was in fine wine or art? How would we tax that? This is why this doesn't exist. \"There's a lot of populism out about this, and I'm frustrated. I see colleagues sometimes say this in parliament and I say: 'Come on, get serious.'\" Ms Dodds said that while she had not spoken directly with Ms Reeves about a wealth tax, she believed the \"trade-off we have to consider in a world of lots of difficult trade-offs is potentially making some big and significant changes early, or having to make many tactical changes through the parliament and potentially being forced into some of those difficult decisions anyway later on\"."

Entering the world on 26 July, Thaddeus Daniel Pierce was born from an embryo that had been stored in a tank for just over 30 years, as reported by MIT Technology Review. That embryo was \"adopted\" from the biological mother, who had kept it frozen since 1994, by Lindsey and Tim Pierce, who live in Ohio. It was transferred into Lindsey's uterus in November 2024, who gave birth to baby Thaddeus at the weekend. His adopted dad Tim was just a toddler when the embryo was created, and Thaddeus also has a biological sister who is now 30, with her own 10-year-old daughter. The adoptive mother Lindsey Pierce told Technology Review: \"He is so chill. We are in awe that we have this precious baby.\" It all came about because both the biological mother and the adopting parents were linked up by a Christian \"embryo adoption\" agency. \n                  Scotland approves world's 'biggest offshore windfarm' project - days after Donald Trump pressured First Minister to scrap renewables\n                 \n                  Ofcom launches investigation into new age checks on 34 pornography websites\n                 \n                  'It makes me sad and angry': Bereaved mother urges parents to get their children vaccinated\n                 How the baby was created  As reported by Technology Review, the baby's biological mother and father went through IVF treatment in the 1990s. They created four healthy embryos but the mother, Linda Archerd, had just one of them transferred - who became the now 30-year-old biological sister of Thaddeus. The other three embryos were frozen in the hopes of one day having another baby. But things changed, Linda and her husband separated, and when she reached the menopause she decided to reassess the future of the embryos. Linda, a Christian, decided against donating the embryos to science or giving them to an anonymous couple. Instead, she opted for \"embryo adoption\", which allowed her to have a say in the future parents - with the process overseen by a religious agency. Nightlight Christian Adoptions took on the embryos and placed them with Lindsey and Tim Pierce. They fitted Linda's criteria of a married, Caucasian Christian couple, and went on to have Thaddeus - giving him a biblical name. One of the embryos stopped growing, two were transferred Lindsey's uterus, and one developed into a foetus. After Thaddeus was born, Linda, now 62, told Technology Review that he resembles his big sister. \"The first thing that I noticed when Lindsey sent me his pictures is how much he looks like my daughter when she was a baby.\" Christian embryo adoption agencies Before Thaddeus, other babies had been born from embryos 27 and 30 years old. But such cases are rare because few organisations are willing to take on old embryos, concerned about the time and manner in which they have been stored. The IVF doctor who looked after the Pierces, John Gordon, also a Christian, set up the Rejoice Fertility Clinic to reduce the number of embryos held in storage. Millions of embryos are estimated to be stored in freezers around the world, leftover from IVF procedures, which often yield more than can be implanted."

        "Content": "\n          Scotland correspondent\n              @ConnorGillies\n The Scottish Government has given approval for what is being called the world's \"biggest offshore windfarms\" just days after US President Donald Trump pressured Scotland's First Minister to scrap renewable projects. The US president branded the turbines a \"con-job\" and described those along Scotland's coastline as \"some of the ugliest you've ever seen\". Mr Trump raised the issue during face-to-face talks with Scottish First Minister John Swinney on the president's visit to Aberdeenshire on Tuesday.  The lobbying by Trump appears to have failed because, as of Thursday morning, the Scottish Government issued licences for the Berwick Bank project in the waters off the Scottish Borders. SSE, the developer, has described the project as the largest in the world, with the possibility of powering six million homes when complete. Mr Trump said at the weekend that offshore wind is \"ruining\" Scotland and Europe, and claimed it is \"killing the birds\". John Swinney told Sky News following the summit with the US president that \"we are not going to be able to agree on all subjects and I am a believer in climate change\". Announcing approval on Thursday, the Scottish Government said that Berwick Bank could generate enough electricity each year to power every household in Scotland around twice over. Scottish Secretary Ian Murray said: \"These large-scale renewable energy projects will ensure people in Scotland truly benefit from clean power, lower bills, and good quality job opportunities.\" Read more from Connor Gillies:Starmer missed a golden opportunity to press POTUSLiving beside the UK's first drug consumption room Stephen Wheeler, managing director of SSE Renewables, added: \"Berwick Bank has the potential to rapidly scale-up Scotland's operational renewable energy capacity and can accelerate the delivery of homegrown, affordable and secure clean energy to UK consumers from Scottish offshore wind, helping meet the UK's clean power ambition by 2030.\" The final plans will need to be approved by Scottish ministers before Berwick Bank proceeds."

Last week, new rules came into force requiring sites that allow adult content to bring in measures to prove that someone using them is over the age of 18. But Ofcom has now opened formal investigations into whether some providers have put effective age checks in place.

        "Content": "\n          Chief North of England correspondent\n              @GregMilamSky\n  The mother of a 10-year-old girl who died from complications of measles has urged parents to have their children vaccinated amid a surge of cases. Renae Archer was too young to have the MMR vaccine when she caught the infection at just five months old. A decade later, she was diagnosed with subacute sclerosing panencephalitis, a very rare brain disease. She died in 2023. Her mother Becky believes Renae might not have caught measles if more people had inoculated their children. The warning comes as rates of vaccine uptake continue to fall. The recent death of a child with measles at Alder Hey Hospital in Liverpool put the focus on a surge of cases in a city with low levels of vaccination. It has left communities with rates of vaccination below the 95% level seen to provide herd immunity, where enough people are protected to prevent the virus spreading. Becky Archer said: \"It does make me quite sad and angry because they are potentially putting their children at risk. \"We just want people to open their eyes to someone that's actually been through it and not the nonsense that's being spread out on social media or on telly. \"I just want people to be knowledgeable of how serious a situation can be.\" Read more: What parents need to know about measles The latest figures on childhood vaccination show that coverage in the UK has been falling in recent years and is now below that target of 95% for all vaccines by age five. The vaccination rate for England is lower than in other UK nations, and particularly low in London. Just 57% in Kensington and Chelsea have had their full measles vaccination course by their fifth birthday, compared to 90% on average across Scotland - though the rate in Scotland has also fallen from 93% a decade earlier. Outside of London, the North West now has among the lowest vaccination rates for most of the main childhood vaccines. There are fears that it has led to a rise in the number of cases of measles, and the latest monthly update in England published today shows that an additional 145 cases have been reported since the last publication on 3 July. Liverpool has one of the lowest measles vaccination rates outside of London, with a quarter of children not completing a full MMR vaccination course by their fifth birthday, according to the latest figures from the UK Health and Security Agency for March 2025. Seventeen cases of measles have been recorded at Alder Hey in recent weeks, and doctors are reassuring parents that the vaccine is safe, free and available. The hospital's chief nurse Nathan Askew said: \"Measles is often thought of as just a routine childhood illness but actually it's incredibly contagious. \"The problem is that when that's passed on, particularly in schools, nurseries and other environments where children are close together, there's a real problem with children becoming unwell.\" Low immunisation rates have been blamed on vaccine hesitancy among parents, but experts say a lack of information on the importance and availability of vaccines is also a significant factor. At catch-up clinic provided by Mersey Care NHS Foundation Trust in Liverpool, parents including Natalia Figeuroa have been bringing their children in. She admits she lost track of her son's vaccinations, but worries that parents are being confused. \"I think parents are trying to make the right decision but the misinformation that's out there is overclouding their judgement,\" she said. \"My child attends a specialist provision which is a school that carries many children with disabilities, physically and mentally, and it's really hard to see that those kids could be exposed to an illness that is quite preventable with a vaccine. \"I'm hoping parents will start to think not only about their own children but those other children who cannot get vaccinations for numerous reasons.\" Read more from Greg Milam:'Little angels' remembered a year on from Southport attackFamilies demand action to stop drivers running red lights Becky Archer was due to give birth the day she was told that Renae's condition was fatal. She died a few days later, and her mother believes she would want her story told. \"She was really caring person and she wouldn't have wanted any other family to go through losing their child,\" she said."

The billionaire's Arora Group said they are proposing a shorter new runway which would avoid the costly need to divert the M25 motorway while being able to accommodate aircraft of all sizes. The company said building a 2,800-metre third runway, instead of the full-length 3,500-metre runway planned by the airport, would result in \"reduced risk\" and avoid \"spiralling cost\". Arora Group's Heathrow West proposal states the new runway could be fully operational by 2035. The plan rivals one by the airport's own owners, which will be submitted to the government on Thursday, after Chancellor Rachel Reeves gave her backing for a third runway during a speech in January. Transport Secretary Heidi Alexander will then review the Airports National Policy Statement, which provides the basis for decision-making on any Development Consent Order application.  The plan by the hotel tycoon's company also includes building a new terminal which would open in two phases, in 2036 and 2040. \n                  Heathrow submits plans for third runway - and says it can be built within a decade \n                 \n                  Airlines furious after another technical glitch cancels flights\n                 \n                  Heathrow-funded group sending 'incredibly misleading' mail to homes across west London, campaigners allege \n                 The proposal, developed with infrastructure company Bechtel, has a cost estimate of under £25bn, not including the redevelopment of the airport's existing central area.

Hogan, 71, was pronounced dead in hospital last week, less than 90 minutes after medics arrived at his home in Clearwater, Florida, in response to a call about a \"cardiac arrest\". The report released on Thursday noted his death was from a \"natural\" cause and formally listed as \"acute myocardial infarction\", a technical term for a heart attack. In his honour, Florida governor Ron DeSantis said flags will be flown at half-mast at all official buildings on Friday, which he declared \"Hulk Hogan Day in Florida\". The pro-wrestling icon, whose real name was Terry Gene Bollea, previously had leukaemia and atrial fibrillation, an irregular heart rhythm, the report from the District Six Medical Examiner added. Hogan was perhaps the biggest star in WWE's long history. He was known for both his larger-than-life personality, including ripping shirts, not just in the ring but also at the Republican National Convention. Hogan was the main draw for the first-ever WrestleMania in 1985 and was a fixture for years in its signature event.  He faced everyone from Andre The Giant and Randy Savage to The Rock and even company chairman Vince McMahon. He claimed his first WWE world championship by defeating the Iron Sheik in 1984. Hogan went on to win five more world championships and was inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame in 2005 by Sylvester Stallone. He appeared in numerous movies and television shows, including his own reality series, and in 2024 endorsed Donald Trump's presidential bid.

        "Content": "\n          Culture and entertainment reporter\n              @gemmapeplow\n Lawyers for Sean \"Diddy\" Combs have called for him to be acquitted of prostitution-related offences, or given a new trial on the same charges. Combs, 55, was found guilty of two counts of transportation for engagement in prostitution at the end of his high-profile trial in New York earlier this month - for flying girlfriends and male sex workers around the US and abroad for sexual encounters referred to as \"freak offs\". However, he was cleared of more serious charges of racketeering, conspiracy and sex-trafficking. The hip-hop mogul has been in prison since his arrest in September 2024 and is due to be sentenced in October. On Tuesday, his lawyers made a renewed request for his release on a $50m bond ahead of the hearing. Now, they have filed another motion to the court, saying it \"should either grant a judgment of acquittal or, at a minimum, a new trial\" on the prostitution-related offences. In the new filing, Combs's defence team said the US government had \"painted him as a monster\" ever since his arrest, but argued his two-month trial showed allegations of a \"20-year racketeering enterprise and of sex trafficking multiple women... were not supported by credible evidence, and the jury rejected them\".  They also say that to their knowledge, he is \"the only person\" ever convicted of these charges for the conduct he was accused of in court. \"It is undisputed that he had no commercial motive and that all involved were adults,\" the filing states. \"The men chose to travel and engage in the activity voluntarily. The verdict confirms the women were not vulnerable or exploited or trafficked or sexually assaulted during the freak offs or hotel nights.\" Read more:How the trial unfoldedThe rise and fall of Sean 'Diddy' Combs They describe the prosecution's evidence on the counts as \"thin at best\" and say the trial would have been \"totally different\" had the rapper only been charged with the prostitution-related offences and not the more serious counts. \"Sean Combs sits in jail based on evidence that he paid adult male escorts and entertainers who engaged in consensual sexual activities with his former girlfriends, which he videotaped and later watched with the girlfriends. That is not prostitution, and if it is, his conviction is unconstitutional,\" the filing says. Combs, one of the most influential hip-hop producers of all time, faces being jailed for several years after his conviction on the prostitution-related charges. But he was cleared of the more serious charges that could have put him in prison for life - and the verdict was hailed a \"victory\" by his team. Immediately after he was acquitted of those charges, his lawyers asked for his release on bond. The request was denied by Judge Arun Subramanian, who heard the trial, and said Combs at the time had not met the burden of showing by clear and convincing evidence a \"lack of danger to any person or the community\"."
