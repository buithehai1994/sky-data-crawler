        "Content": "\n          Political reporter\n              @alexrogerssky\n  Sir Keir Starmer and Emmanuel Macron have agreed a pilot \"one in, one out\" scheme for migrants who cross the Channel in small boats. On the third and final day of the Anglo-French summit in the UK, the British prime minister and French president announced a trial of the scheme that will allow small boat migrants to be sent back to France. Politics latest: Warning to fix migration or risk 'extreme right wing parties'  In return, Britain would accept the same number of asylum seekers - who try to come to the UK by a safe route - as those who are returned to France. Speaking next to Emmanuel Macron at a news conference in north west London, Sir Keir Starmer said it would come into force in a matter of \"weeks\". \"Migrants arriving via small boat will be detained and returned to France in short order,\" he said. \"In exchange for every return, a different individual will be allowed to come here via a safe route - controlled and legal - subject to strict security checks, and only open to those who have not tried to enter the UK illegally.\" \n                  Nigel Farage hits back at Emmanuel Macron after French president sparks fresh Brexit row\n                 \n                  Is migration helping or hurting the UK?\n                 \n                  In pictures: Princess of Wales, Elton John and Mick Jagger at King's state banquet for Macron\n                 The prime minister said the arrangement would begin as a \"pilot\", with reports suggesting that just 50 people per week will be sent to France back across the Channel. However, neither Mr Macron nor Sir Keir mentioned any figures in the news conference. The announcement of the deal comes as part of Mr Macron's high-stakes state visit to the UK - the first of a European leader since Brexit. This morning, dozens of people arrived in the UK on a dinghy in scenes witnessed by Sky News. So far more than 21,000 people have arrived in the UK via small boats so far this year - a rise of almost 50% on the number crossing in 2024.  Both leaders have described the Channel crossings as a mutual burden and crisis that must be tackled with co-operation. Hailing their partnership, Sir Keir said that while there was \"no silver bullet\" to tackle the issue, the pair could \"finally turn the tables\" with \"a united effort, new tactics and a new level of intent\". He said the new deal would show people that attempting to cross the Channel in small boats would be \"in vain\", adding: \"The jobs they have been promised in the UK will no longer exist because of the nationwide crackdown we're delivering on illegal working which is on a completely unprecedented scale.\" Mr Macron also welcomed the deal reached with the UK, saying it was \"a good agreement\". Brexit creates crossing 'incentive' He suggested Brexit was to blame in the uptick in the number of crossings, arguing that the UK's departure from the European Union meant there was no way for people to be returned to mainland Europe after people crossed the Channel. He was referring to the Dublin regulation, which the UK was signatory to when it was a member of the EU, but is no longer. \"Many people in your country explained that Brexit would make it possible to fight more effectively against illegal immigration,\" Mr Macron said. Read more:Ex-Tory chairman Sir Jake Berry defects to ReformWhat is a wealth tax? \"But it's in fact since Brexit [that] the UK has no migratory agreement with the EU. \"It creates an incentive to make the crossing, the precise opposite of what Brexit had promised.\" He added that the British people were \"sold a lieâ€¦which is that the problem was Europe, but the problem has become Brexit\". We've had no confirmation on how many people will be sent back to France, but Sky News understands that the government expects around 50 people per week will be returned when the programme starts. The deal is subject to sign off from European lawyers before it starts. In terms of the \"how\", people who cross the Channel will be detained and have their details taken. Those picked for the pilot will be kept in detention, told their claim for asylum is inadmissible, and sent back to France. There will be a way for people to appeal this, but cases will get reviewed. When someone is sent back to France, a person with a legitimate asylum claim - who has not crossed by small boat before - will be sent the other way. The costs for the pilot will come from existing Home Office budgets. It's not clear how long the pilot will last, but it will be kept under ongoing review. His words sparked condemnation from Reform UK leader Nigel Farage, who said he did not think \"this so-called deal will make any difference at all\" - citing the European Convention on Human Rights, which the UK is a signatory to. Speaking to reporters from Westminster, he said: \"If we even try to deport people across the Channel we will run straight into the European Convention on Human Rights as written into British law, in the human rights act. The lawyers will have a field day and will find lots of reasons why people can't be deported. \"Nobody who crosses the English Channel illegally, in a boat, should ever be given refugee status, should ever be given leave to remain, and should be deported and if we did that, it would stop within a fortnight.\" The French president also praised the prime minister for committing to reducing the \"pull factors\" that attract people to the UK from France - including the flexible labour market. During a Q&A session, Sir Keir was asked whether the scheme would be effective given the large numbers of people who are making the dangerous journey across the Channel. He responded by saying that if the pilot proved to be successful, \"the numbers will ramp up\". However, he refused to say how the pilot would select who might be returned to France, arguing it might \"undermine\" how the scheme would operate."

This is some deft diplomacy from Sir Keir, who has been love-bombing his French counterpart ever since he became prime minister - trying to get closer ties, be it on security, on trade, and now of course on small boats. And he has got a win today - he's got President Macron to agree a deterrent deal. Politics latest: Macron stokes undiplomatic Brexit row You remember the Conservatives were trying the Rwanda plan to deter people from coming by sending them back to Rwanda, a third country, if they came here illegally. What the prime minister has agreed with President Macron today is a big deal. It's a one in, one out deal. What they're going to do is, if someone arrives here illegally, they will be sent back to France, and in return, the UK will accept a legitimate asylum seeker. It might be someone who has family ties. \n                  Nigel Farage hits back at Emmanuel Macron after French president sparks fresh Brexit row\n                 \n                  King Charles asks RNLI crew whether they 'get a lot?' while discussing small boat crossings\n                 \n                  This flimsy dinghy most likely took 50 people to Britain today\n                  It's going to start off really small - think of it as a pilot - as they're going to test it out, see if it works. It might be just a handful of people being sent back, maybe just under a thousand or so by the end of the year. But they will hopefully, for the prime minister, scale it up and it could become a real deterrent. Read more from Sky News:Ex-Tory chairman defects to ReformFarage hits back at Macron over Brexit row  I'll leave you with just one more thought: As Prime Minister Starmer and President Macron were doing this deal today, Nigel Farage was in the English Channel documenting illegal migrants making that crossing - 79 people being picked up by Border Force, taken off a dinghy and into Dover. Polling out this morning by Portland suggests four in 10 voters who are planning on going to Reform would go back to Labour if the prime minister tackles small boats and drives down the crossings. There is a real political imperative for him to try to start to resolve this problem. It's going to count at the ballot box - immigration is a top-three issue in this country when it comes to voters."

        "Content": "\n          Crime correspondent\n              @skymartinbrunt\n  Three police officers, who have been voted Britain's bravest officers, have described confronting, disarming and arresting the Southport killer Axel Rudakubana. The trio, from the Merseyside force, were first on the scene as the crazed teenager rampaged with a knife through a children's dance workshop last summer, murdering three youngsters and attacking others. Southport wasn't Sergeant Greg Gillespie's beat and he was there that day covering for a colleague on holiday. He described the scene outside the building on Hart Street as he arrived on his own. He said: \"There was maybe 20 or 25 adults, and all of them were looking at me, and all of them have this look of terror and fear, panic on their faces and I knew whatever it was we were turning up to was really, really bad.\" His colleagues PC Luke Holden, 31, and PCSO Tim Parry, 32, drove fast from Southport police station and were 30 seconds or so behind Sgt Gillespie. PC Holden said: \"I jumped out of the police car, and immediately there were people running up to me and one was an off-duty colleague who was screaming and crying, pointing 'he's in there, he's there' and then as I started to run to the building I could see blood all over the floor. \n                  Officers who confronted Southport killer reveal how they disarmed him - as they are nominated for police bravery award\n                 \n                  Southport attack: Mother saw CCTV of daughter being 'dragged back into building' - before being stabbed 20 more times\n                 \n                  'Wholesale failure' to address risks posed by Southport attacker before murders, says public inquiry chairman\n                 \"As I got to the door, that was partially smashed. Greg was stood there one foot in, one foot out. \"There was a large puddle of blood on the floor outside the door and he just looked at me for one second and said, are you ready? And that was it, there was no conversation. \"There was nothing else going on. He said, 'Are you ready', and I said, 'yeah, let's go'.\" 'It was a horrific scene' PCSO Parry, who doesn't carry a baton or a pepper spray like his colleagues, went to the back of the building to stop people going, help anyone who needed it and get information on the number of suspects inside. He said: \"It was a horrific scene to really go into because I was so unprepared with the equipment I had.\" An additional problem for the three officers was the absence of firearms back-up; none of the force's armed response units were close by. Inside the building was death, injury, fear and chaos. PC Holden said: \"Walking in, I identified the suspect with a bloodied knife in his hand at the top of the stairs, pointed my taser at him and thought this is going to go one of two ways. \"He's gonna listen to us or he's gonna fight with us and try and stab us. \"Me and Greg formed a solid wall with our shoulders, walking up the stairs so he couldn't get past us. \"He was a couple of metres away, within striking distance, and I thought if he does anything to threaten me or any sort of movement I don't like, he would be tasered immediately.\" Rudakubana was a 'coward' Sgt Gillespie, 42, said he'd read media reports suggesting Rudakubana had already decided to give himself up by the time police arrived. He said: \"I disagree with that. I saw him, made eye contact with him, saw his facial expression, saw his body language and the way he moved himself into a position at the top of the stairs, showing us he had a knife. \"He was fronting us, like he was saying 'I've got a knife, what are you going to do about it?' And I think the second he realised he was looking at two people who weren't scared of him... all that bravery that he must have summoned up to attack defenceless children... he lost that straightaway and he threw down the knife. \"It'd be hard to paint him as more of a coward than he actually is, but I think that shows a lot. He was all brave to attack children, but the second he saw two men walking towards him, he didn't want to know.\" But the officers had no idea if Rudakubana had more weapons, so they attacked him and knocked him to the ground. PCSO Parry ended up on top of the suspect. He said: \"Through adrenaline I just kind of put him on his front to make sure he wasn't going anywhere until other colleagues arrived. \"I was trying to alert anyone else hiding in the building that everything had, hopefully, now stopped and we would deal with them as best we could and make sure they were safe.\"  Read more:Girl still 'fighting to survive' Southport attackMum of Southport victim praises communityTeacher calls for girl to be remembered In January, Rudakubana, who was 17 at the time, admitted the murders of seven-year-old Elsie Dot Stancombe, Bebe King, six, and Alice da Silva Aguiar who was nine. He also admitted the attempted murder of eight other children and two adults. He was jailed for life with a minimum of 52 years to serve. Bravery award is 'bittersweet' At his sentencing, the judge said that if he hadn't been stopped he would have gone on to kill all 26 children at the dance class. \"By the time we got the call I think it was already too late to save two of the victims,\" said Sgt Gillespie. \"But there was an adult, one of the dance teachers, who was shielding another child in the toilet, within arm's distance from him and I don't think he realised. \"If he had known they were there I'm sure he would have tried to attack them, so it's a good job we got there when we did because we potentially saved them from being injured or killed.\" Before winning last night's accolade, PCSO Parry summed up the trio's thoughts about their bravery award nomination. He said: \"It's bittersweet. I feel proud being nominated, but it comes off the back of such a horrific incident. \"It's hard to explain. It's good to have the recognition from your peers and colleagues, but in my eyes it's not like a celebration.\" 70 officers from around England and Wales were nominated for the Police Federation national bravery awards."

Jurors were shown footage of PC Lydia Ward with blood streaming from her nose following the incident. The court heard she was attacked by Mohammed Fahir Amaaz in July 2024 after officers tried to arrest him for allegedly headbutting a man in an airport Starbucks. Footage shows him resisting and a brawl breaking out between police, Amaaz, and his brother Muhammad Amaad. PC Ward said they intended to detain Amaaz and take him outside but he started to \"tense up and resist\" when colleagues took hold of him.  \"Things escalated very quickly. It just went from nought to a hundred,\" she told Liverpool Crown Court.

Amaaz is alleged to have caused actual bodily harm to PC Ward and PC Marsden. He is also accused of the assault of PC Cook and the earlier assault in Starbucks of Abdulkareem Ismaeil. His brother, Amaad, is also alleged to have caused actual bodily harm to PC Marsden. Both men, from Rochdale, deny the allegations. The trial continues."

Elsewhere in Gaza, the Nasser Hospital reported another 21 deaths in airstrikes in Khan Younis and in the nearby coastal area of Muwasi. It said three children and their mother were among the dead. Israel said its troops have been dismantling more than 130 Hamas infrastructure sites in Khan Younis over the past week, including missile launch sites, weapons storage facilities and a 500m tunnel. On Wednesday, a soldier was shot dead when militants burst out of a tunnel and tried to abduct him, the military added.  Eighteen soldiers have been killed in the past three weeks - one of the deadliest periods for the Israeli army in months. A 22-year-old Israeli man was also killed on Thursday by two attackers in a supermarket in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, said the Magen David Adom emergency service. People on site reportedly shot and killed the attackers but information on their identity has so far not been released.

However, Sky News understands the Israeli government thinks the chances of a permanent truce are \"questionable\". More than 57,000 Palestinians have been killed in the war - more than half are women and children, according to Gaza's Hamas-controlled health ministry. Its figure does not differentiate between civilians and fighters. The war began in October 2023 after Hamas killed around 1,200 people in Israel and kidnapped 251 others. Some of them remain In Gaza and are a crucial part of ceasefire negotiations, which also include a planned surge in humanitarian aid into the strip."

        "Content": "Heat-related deaths in England and Wales could rise 50-fold by the 2070s as climate change collides with an ageing population, a study has warned. It comes as areas of the UK face another heatwave, with temperatures over the next few days forecast to be above average and exceed 30C (86F) for many. Annual heat-related deaths might climb into the tens of thousands in the coming decades, according to research by University College London (UCL) and the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. They say today's baseline figure of 634 heat deaths a year could hit 10,317 in the 2050s and, in a worst-case scenario, 34,027 in the 2070s. The prediction is based on 4.3C of warming and minimal efforts to adapt. Older people are more vulnerable to extreme heat, and the research warns the population of England and Wales is expected to age significantly over the next five decades. A more optimistic scenario - where the rise is only 1.6C from pre-industrial levels and major efforts are made to adapt - still envisages 3,007 deaths a year in the 2050s and 4,592 in the 2070s. \n                  UK weather: Country set to have new heatwave - with temperatures over 30C in some areas, Met Office forecasts\n                 \n                  Heatwave likely killed 263 people in London, study estimates\n                 \n                  Weather: What is a 'heat dome' - and how long is it set to affect the UK?\n                 The experts want more action to adapt homes and cities. Suggestions include better ventilation, increased air conditioning, shutters, urban forests, roofs that better reflect heat and more support for the vulnerable. Researchers warn 2022's exceptionally hot summer - when it hit 40.3C (104F) and 2,985 excess heat-related deaths were recorded - could be the \"new normal\" by the 2050s. \"Over the next 50 years, the health impacts of a warming climate are going to be significant,\" said Dr Clare Heaviside from UCL. \"We can mitigate their severity by reducing greenhouse gas emissions and with carefully planned adaptations, but we have to start now.\" Read more on Sky News:Man stabbed to death near five-star London hotelHeat health alerts and hosepipe ban issued The study warns there could be between 21 to 32 extra hot days annually in the 2060s under scenarios with the least warming, and up to 64 to 73 in the most pessimistic case. Commenting on the study, Dr Akshay Deoras, from the University of Reading, said: \"If floods and storms are the loud alarms of climate change, extreme heat is its silent killer. \"It is disproportionately lethal, often going unnoticed until it's too late. With another heatwave bearing down on the UK, this warning feels more urgent than ever.\" The study is published in science journal PLoS."

Lawyers for Mahmoud Khalil have filed a claim against the administration alleging he was falsely imprisoned, maliciously prosecuted and smeared as an antisemite as the government sought to deport him over his role in campus protests. The 30-year-old graduate student at Columbia University told Sky News's lead world presenter Yalda Hakim being detained by ICE agents in March \"felt like kidnapping\". He described \"plain-clothed agents and unmarked cars\" taking him \"from one place to another, expecting you just to follow orders and shackled all the time\", which he said was \"really scary\".  Mr Khalil said he was not presented with an arrest warrant and wasn't told where he was being taken. He said the detention centre he was taken to was \"as far from humane as it could be\" and \"a place where you have no rights whatsoever\". \"You share a dorm with over 70 men with no privacy, with lights on all the time, with really terrible food. You're basically being dehumanised at every opportunity. It's a black hole,\" he added. Mr Khalil said he would also accept an official apology from the Trump administration. The Trump administration celebrated Mr Khalil's arrest, promising to deport him and others whose protests against Israel it declared were \"pro-terrorist, antisemitic, anti-American activity\". Mr Khalil said after around 36 hours in captivity he was allowed to speak to his wife, who was pregnant at the time. \"These were very scary hours, I did not know what was happening on the outside. I did not know that my wife was safe,\" he said.

Asked about missing the birth of his son while he was in prison, Mr Khalil said: \"I don't think there's any word that can describe the agony and the sadness that I went through, to be deprived from such a divine moment, from a moment that my wife and I had always dreamed about.\" Meanwhile, the deportation case against Mr Khalil is continuing to wind its way through the immigration court system."

The orginal Hermes Birkin, which had belonged to and was named after British actor and singer Jane Birkin, went under the hammer at Sotheby's in Paris on Thursday. It is also now the second most expensive fashion item ever sold. The bag was designed for Birkin, who starred in a number of French and British films from the 1960s onwards before her death in 2023. She happened to be seated next to Jean-Louis Dumas, then artistic director of Hermes, on an Air France flight in 1981. Carrying all her items in a wicker basket, she complained to Dumas that the handbags available at the time tended to be too small to fit all of her belongings. The pair began sketching designs on the back of a sick bag, and by 1985, Hermes had produced a prototype and presented it to Birkin, requesting her permission to name the new style in her honour. \n                  Ukraine war latest: Security agent shot dead in Kyiv; Trump says he warned Putin he would 'bomb s***' out of Moscow\n                 \n                  'Physical threat' from Iran on people living in UK has 'increased significantly', watchdog says\n                 \n                  Palestinian activist detained by ICE suing Trump administration for $20m\n                 It has since become a status symbol, worn by celebrities including Kate Moss, Victoria Beckham, Khloe Kardashian and Jennifer Lopez.

The most expensive fashion item ever sold was the pair of ruby red slippers worn by Judy Garland in the film The Wizard of Oz, which fetched $32.5m (Â£24m) in 2024."

        "Content": "\n          Crime correspondent\n              @skymartinbrunt\n  Three police officers, who have been voted Britain's bravest officers, have described confronting, disarming and arresting the Southport killer Axel Rudakubana. The trio, from the Merseyside force, were first on the scene as the crazed teenager rampaged with a knife through a children's dance workshop last summer, murdering three youngsters and attacking others. Southport wasn't Sergeant Greg Gillespie's beat and he was there that day covering for a colleague on holiday. He described the scene outside the building on Hart Street as he arrived on his own. He said: \"There was maybe 20 or 25 adults, and all of them were looking at me, and all of them have this look of terror and fear, panic on their faces and I knew whatever it was we were turning up to was really, really bad.\" His colleagues PC Luke Holden, 31, and PCSO Tim Parry, 32, drove fast from Southport police station and were 30 seconds or so behind Sgt Gillespie. PC Holden said: \"I jumped out of the police car, and immediately there were people running up to me and one was an off-duty colleague who was screaming and crying, pointing 'he's in there, he's there' and then as I started to run to the building I could see blood all over the floor. \n                  Officers who confronted Southport killer reveal how they disarmed him - as they are nominated for police bravery award\n                 \n                  Southport attack: Mother saw CCTV of daughter being 'dragged back into building' - before being stabbed 20 more times\n                 \n                  'Wholesale failure' to address risks posed by Southport attacker before murders, says public inquiry chairman\n                 \"As I got to the door, that was partially smashed. Greg was stood there one foot in, one foot out. \"There was a large puddle of blood on the floor outside the door and he just looked at me for one second and said, are you ready? And that was it, there was no conversation. \"There was nothing else going on. He said, 'Are you ready', and I said, 'yeah, let's go'.\" 'It was a horrific scene' PCSO Parry, who doesn't carry a baton or a pepper spray like his colleagues, went to the back of the building to stop people going, help anyone who needed it and get information on the number of suspects inside. He said: \"It was a horrific scene to really go into because I was so unprepared with the equipment I had.\" An additional problem for the three officers was the absence of firearms back-up; none of the force's armed response units were close by. Inside the building was death, injury, fear and chaos. PC Holden said: \"Walking in, I identified the suspect with a bloodied knife in his hand at the top of the stairs, pointed my taser at him and thought this is going to go one of two ways. \"He's gonna listen to us or he's gonna fight with us and try and stab us. \"Me and Greg formed a solid wall with our shoulders, walking up the stairs so he couldn't get past us. \"He was a couple of metres away, within striking distance, and I thought if he does anything to threaten me or any sort of movement I don't like, he would be tasered immediately.\" Rudakubana was a 'coward' Sgt Gillespie, 42, said he'd read media reports suggesting Rudakubana had already decided to give himself up by the time police arrived. He said: \"I disagree with that. I saw him, made eye contact with him, saw his facial expression, saw his body language and the way he moved himself into a position at the top of the stairs, showing us he had a knife. \"He was fronting us, like he was saying 'I've got a knife, what are you going to do about it?' And I think the second he realised he was looking at two people who weren't scared of him... all that bravery that he must have summoned up to attack defenceless children... he lost that straightaway and he threw down the knife. \"It'd be hard to paint him as more of a coward than he actually is, but I think that shows a lot. He was all brave to attack children, but the second he saw two men walking towards him, he didn't want to know.\" But the officers had no idea if Rudakubana had more weapons, so they attacked him and knocked him to the ground. PCSO Parry ended up on top of the suspect. He said: \"Through adrenaline I just kind of put him on his front to make sure he wasn't going anywhere until other colleagues arrived. \"I was trying to alert anyone else hiding in the building that everything had, hopefully, now stopped and we would deal with them as best we could and make sure they were safe.\"  Read more:Girl still 'fighting to survive' Southport attackMum of Southport victim praises communityTeacher calls for girl to be remembered In January, Rudakubana, who was 17 at the time, admitted the murders of seven-year-old Elsie Dot Stancombe, Bebe King, six, and Alice da Silva Aguiar who was nine. He also admitted the attempted murder of eight other children and two adults. He was jailed for life with a minimum of 52 years to serve. Bravery award is 'bittersweet' At his sentencing, the judge said that if he hadn't been stopped he would have gone on to kill all 26 children at the dance class. \"By the time we got the call I think it was already too late to save two of the victims,\" said Sgt Gillespie. \"But there was an adult, one of the dance teachers, who was shielding another child in the toilet, within arm's distance from him and I don't think he realised. \"If he had known they were there I'm sure he would have tried to attack them, so it's a good job we got there when we did because we potentially saved them from being injured or killed.\" Before winning last night's accolade, PCSO Parry summed up the trio's thoughts about their bravery award nomination. He said: \"It's bittersweet. I feel proud being nominated, but it comes off the back of such a horrific incident. \"It's hard to explain. It's good to have the recognition from your peers and colleagues, but in my eyes it's not like a celebration.\" 70 officers from around England and Wales were nominated for the Police Federation national bravery awards."

        "Content": " The threat of physical attacks by Iran on people living in the UK has increased \"significantly\" since 2022, according to a new report by parliament's intelligence watchdog.   Iran poses a \"wide-ranging, persistent and unpredictable threat\" to the UK, according to the Intelligence and Security Committee. It also said Iran's intelligence services were \"willing and able - often through third party agents - to attempt assassination within the UK, and kidnap from the UK\". The report said there have been 15 murder or kidnap attempts against British citizens or UK-based individuals since the beginning of 2022 and August 2023. The report authors add: \"Whilst Iran's activity appears to be less strategic and on a smaller scale than Russia and China, Iran poses a wide-ranging threat to UK national security, which should not be underestimated: it is persistent and crucially - unpredictable.\" The committee also says that while the threat is often focused on dissidents and other opponents to the regime, there is also an increased threat to Jewish and Israeli interests in the UK. The report warns that while Iran has not developed a nuclear weapon, it has taken steps towards that goal. It found that Iran had been \"broadly compliant\" with the 2015 Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), aimed at limiting its nuclear ambitions. But since Donald Trump withdrew from that deal in 2018, the report said the nuclear threat had increased and Tehran \"had the capability to arm in a relatively short period\". The UK government is also accused of \"fire-fighting\" rather than developing a real understanding of Iran. The report says: \"The government's policy on Iran has suffered from a focus on crisis management, driven by concerns over Iran's nuclear programme, to the exclusion of other issues. \"As one of our expert witnesses told the committee: 'Strategy is not a word that I think has crossed the lips of policy makers for a while, certainly not in relation to Iran'.\" The committee concluded its evidence-taking in August 2023, the result of two years of work, but the report authors say their conclusions \"remain relevant\". But the report authors questioned whether UK sanctions against individuals would \"in practice deliver behavioural change. Or in fact unhelpfully push Iran towards China\". Sima Sabet, a British-Iranian journalist, was forced to take protection after the security services discovered a plot to kill her. \"It was an assassination attempt so it's very serious. In March 2024 I was asked by counterterrorism police to leave my home, because they had credible information that my life was not safe where I was living, so I had to leave immediately,\" she told Sky News's home editor Jason Farrell. The same night, another Iranian journalist, Pouria Zeraati, was stabbed in the leg in London. Ms Sabet said fleeing her home had a \"massive impact\" on her life. \"You're not free to go out. I have to cover my face in the surrounding area where I live, I have to wear a mask even in 30 degrees weather, I don't do shopping in that neighbourhood, there are loads of your personal freedoms taken by being careful about not being attacked,\" she said. \"You do all of those recommendations and you are not sure if you are going to be attacked or not, and anytime anyone can stab you from the back. We are dealing with the state and dealing with the state means that whatever measures you take, they could be steps ahead of you.\" She described Iran as a \"terrorist state\", adding: \"They don't mind killing their opponents or journalists or anyone who is shedding light on the truth - and that was my only sin.\" In the wake of the report by parliament's intelligence watchdog, Ms Sabet called for the UK government to put \"meaningful pressure on Iran\". The committee also said the British government should consider proscribing the Iranian Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC), although some argue it would limit the UK's ability to talk to and influence Iran. Read more from Sky News:Who is Iran's supreme leader?Defiant Khamenei makes appearanceAnger in Iran over US and Israeli strikes Responding to the report, a UK government spokesperson said: \"The government will take action wherever necessary to protect national security, which is a foundation of our plan for change. \"We have already placed Iran on the enhanced tier of the foreign influence registration scheme and introduced further sanctions against individuals and entities linked to Iran, bringing the total number of sanctions to 450.\" Tehran rejected the committee's findings, claiming the report was \"unfounded, politically motivated and hostile\". The Iranian embassy in the UK said: \"The suggestion that Iran engages in or supports acts of physical violence, espionage, or cyber aggression on British soil or against British interests abroad, is wholly rejected. \"Such accusations are not only defamatory but also dangerous, fuelling unnecessary tensions and undermining diplomatic norms.\" British security services say Tehran uses criminal proxies to carry out its work in Britain. In December, two Romanians were charged after a journalist working for a Persian language media organisation in London was stabbed in the leg. In May, three Iranian men appeared in court charged with assisting Iran's foreign intelligence service and plotting violence against journalists. Earlier this year, the UK government said it would require the Iranian state to register everything it does to exert political influence in the UK, because of what it called increasingly aggressive activity."

And as we draw closer, we can make out dozens of people crowded on board as it sets off from the shore, from a beach near Dunkirk. There is no sign of any police activity on the shore, and there are no police vessels in the water. Instead, the migrants crammed into an inflatable dinghy are being watched by us, on board a private boat, and the looming figure of the Minck, a French search and rescue ship that soon arrives. The dinghy meanders. It's not heading towards Britain but rather hugging the coast. A few of the passengers wave at us cheerfully, but then the boat starts to head back towards the shore. As it nears a different beach, we see a police vehicle - a dune buggy - heading down to meet it. Normal practice is for French police officers to slice through the material of any of these small boats that end up back on shore. Two police officers get out of the buggy and wait. A police helicopter arrives and circles above, performing a tight circle over the heads of the migrants. The police think they might be about to go back on to the beach; in fact, these passengers know that most of them are staying put. The boat stops a short distance from the shore and four people jump out. As they wade towards the beach, the boat turns and starts to head back out to sea. We see the two police officers approach these four men and have a brief conversation. They don't appear to check the bags they are carrying and, if they do question them about why they left the boat, it is the most cursory of conversations. In reality, these people probably don't speak French but they were almost certainly involved in arranging this crossing, which is against the law. But all four walk away, disappearing into the dunes at the back of the beach. Read more:Why do so many try to cross the Channel?Channel crossings rise by 50% in first half of 2025  We follow the boat as it chugs off in the direction of Britain, carrying around 50 people. The Minck returns to shadowing its progress, but its job is limited to offering help if the boat gets into trouble. Otherwise, if the engine keeps working, then this flimsy vessel will reach British waters in a few hours' time."

        "Content": "\n          Senior data journalist\n              @danieljdunford\n One of Sir Keir Starmer's most memorable pre-election promises was that he would \"smash the gangs\" of people smugglers sending people across the English Channel on small boats. That hasn't happened yet. More than 21,000 people have arrived in the UK on small boats so far this year, more than 50% higher than at this point in any previous year. \"We all agree that the situation in the Channel cannot go on as it is,\" said Sir Keir earlier on Thursday, speaking alongside French President Emmanuel Macron. \"We're bringing new tactics into play, and a new level of intent, to tackle illegal migration and break the business model of the criminal gangs,\" he added. So what are those new tactics? For starters, the French have changed rules that had limited them from engaging with migrant boats once they had entered the sea. They've now started using knives to puncture inflatable boats in shallow waters. But what has grabbed most attention is a scheme to exchange illegal migrants in the UK with asylum seekers in France, that Sir Keir says will start \"in the coming weeks\". The plan (just a pilot at this stage) is that the UK will send a number of people - reportedly starting at around 50 a week - who have arrived in the UK after crossing the Channel, back to France. And for each person sent back to France, France will deliver to the UK an asylum seeker with a family connection in Britain. Only people who have not previously attempted to enter the UK illegally will be eligible. How much of a difference will that make to the overall numbers? If it starts at 50 people, not much. More than 200 migrants are estimated to have arrived in the UK on small boats on the day of this announcement alone. And that's not unusual. Since the start of March an average of over 1,000 people have arrived every week. Sending 50 of them back would represent less than 5% of that total. In fact, it would be equivalent to less than one full boat. The average number of migrants per boat increased to 64 in June, the highest level on record. Twenty boats a week arrived on average. Can it be a deterrent? So the reported numbers are small in comparison, but whether the policy will act as a deterrent is a different question. Oxford University's Migration Observatory says \"there is some evidence that suggests a returns deal could affect asylum seekers' decisions to come to the UK from Europe, including in small boats\". \"If the government wants a returns deal to deter people from crossing to the UK, the number of people transferred would be extremely important,\" it adds. Starmer said that the number of people transferred between the two countries would \"ramp up\" if the pilot is successful. How they would define success, or how much it'll rise to, or when, is unclear at the moment however. The Migration Observatory says: \"If the risk of being transferred was very small, it is more likely that prospective asylum seekers would not know about the policy or would be willing to take the risk. How high this proportion would need to be is impossible to forecast.\" The scheme would however represent a significant rise in the number of asylum-related returns that the government delivers currently. In 2024, 2,627 asylum seekers were forcibly returned - usually to their home country - by the UK. Adding 50 people a week to that figure would almost double it. Although of course each return (\"one out\") would be reciprocated by an additional arrival (\"one in\") from France. And there are still questions about how the policy would work in practicality - how the migrants would be selected, and what the UK would do if faced with legal challenges. Sir Keir said that revealing how they would select who might be returned to France might \"undermine\" how the scheme would operate. The Migration Observatory says: \"Even if an agreement is reached that allows a significant number of people to be returned to the EU, it is uncertain how many would be transferred in practice. \"As with the Dublin system [the EU principle that asylum seekers can be returned to the first EU country they entered] in the past, there may be further administrative barriers to returns, such as legal challenges to removal.\" Small boat arrival numbers v other types of migration Since 2020, crossing the Channel in a small boat has been the most common way to arrive illegally in the UK, overtaking smuggling via lorries for example. Small boat arrivals are also certainly responsible for most of the emotion and political attention attached to illegal migration. But they are probably not responsible for the majority of people in the UK who don't have a legal right to remain here. We can only say \"probably\" because data on \"visa overstayers\" - people who arrived in the UK legally but ended up staying longer than they were entitled to - has not been published since 2020. But the last time the figures were published, the number of visa overstayers was up near 100,000, more than twice as high as the record number of annual arrivals in small boats - 45,755 in 2022. This pilot scheme is not designed to tackle that form of illegal migration, although Mr Macron did say that he and Sir Keir had discussed it as part of the summit. All of that illegal migration pales into insignificance compared with the overall net migration, however, despite a recent fall. This is the figure that previous administrations failed to \"get down to the tens of thousands\" as they had pledged to. Between 2023 to 2024 it halved, from 860,000 to 431,000 - mainly thanks to changes made to rules about workers and students bringing dependants under Rishi Sunak's premiership. We get to that \"net\" figure by taking away the 517,000 people who left the UK in the last year from the 948,000 who arrived in the same period. The 50 people a week - to be returned to France, and indeed received from France - that the pilot scheme is reported to be starting off with is equal to 2,600 people a year moving in either direction. That would be just 0.5% of the total number of people leaving the UK each year, and 0.27% of the total arriving. It's appropriate that when we plot that on a chart, it appears so low that it might as well be on the floor. While the numbers reported at the moment are a relative drop in the ocean compared with overall migration figures, Sir Keir will be hoping that the fact he is taking visible action against the problem will bring him a political benefit while Nigel Farage's Reform party lead in the polls. Whether such a small proportion can serve as a deterrent, or even prove that raising the number higher would help, is something that we will observe in the months to come.

        "Content": "\n          Data journalist\n              @joelysantacruz\n Today's figures show that in May the NHS waiting list in England fell, for the third month in a row. There are now 7.36 million outstanding appointments â€“ the lowest level since March 2023.  Health Secretary Wes Streeting welcomed the reduction in the NHS waiting list of 282,000 since Labour took office, down from 7.64 million last July. Speaking in the Commons, he highlighted the experience of a young cancer patient receiving timely treatment as an example of the difference he says Labour has brought to the NHS. But not all waiting times are down. Sky News analysis shows that in nearly half of 147 NHS trusts with available data fewer people are now being treated for cancer within the target than at the start of the year. That target is for 85% of cancer patients to begin treatment within two months of their diagnosis. Only a small number of trusts have achieved this. While 20 trusts met the standard in January, it is down to 15 trusts in May. Performance against the target fell in 62 areas overall between Jan and May, and none of those were meeting the target to begin with. \n                  Dirty work: The fly-tippers turning trash into cash\n                 \n                  Deaths in Gaza rise significantly when a controversial group distributes aid, Sky News analysis reveals\n                 \n                  US warplanes transit through UK: Here's what the flight tracking data shows\n                 Among the worst performing trusts are Mid and South Essex, and Hull University Teaching Hospital, with just 42% and 46% of patients beginning treatment within the target time respectively. The biggest increases in waits were in North Cumbria Integrated Care, where the share of people treated within the target period fell from 70% to 50%, and in Liverpool Women's NHS Foundation Trust, the share fell from 44% to just 26%. See how your local trust is performing in the searchable table below: An NHS spokesperson said: \"Despite the NHS seeing and treating record numbers of people for cancer... we know there is more to do to improve early diagnosis, access to tests and life-saving treatments. \"Our 10 Year Health Plan launched last week sets out some of the ways we will transform cancer care to be fit for the future, including innovation to speed up referral and diagnosis, with more to follow in the National Cancer Plan coming later this year.\" It's not only cancer waits where there are big differences in how long you wait for treatment depending on where you access services. The government has pledged to bring down referral waiting times by 2029, so that no more than 8% patients wait longer than 18 weeks for hospital treatment once they've been referred by a GP. This has not been achieved in England for a decade, but some areas are doing better than others. Several trusts are only managing to ensure less than half of their appointments are offered within the time frame, including just 48% at the Countess of Chester Hospital. This compares to the 99.8% of nearly 4,000 patients treated by Kent Community Health within 18 weeks. Only 13 of the 153 NHS service providers are meeting the target, while many are performing worse than at the start of the year. The largest decreases were around a 6% decrease in performance, including in Dartford and Gravesham, where performance fell to 60% on target, and in Royal Surrey County Hospital, falling to 55%. Just over half - 84 - of the trusts are currently managing to complete 60% of appointments within 18 weeks - which is an interim target they are due to meet by March 2026. Overall, the share of those waiting for longer than 18 weeks has remained mostly static at around 40%. The latest figures show that 39% of the waiting list had been waiting for longer than target in May, compared to 41% in July last year. In Accident and Emergency, nearly one in four trusts have a greater share of patients waiting for longer than the four-hour target to be seen than in January - despite A&Es tending to be more stretched during winter months. However, performance on this target is better than others overall, and around half of those performing worse are still meeting the target, which is that 95% of patients are seen within four hours of arrival. To improve and alleviate pressure on hospital services the government says the health service must \"reform or die\". Labour has set out its vision in a 10-year plan for NHS reform aiming to prioritise community healthcare, shift from late treatment to early intervention, and digitally transform the health service. But addressing hospital performance and inequalities will be key, Stephen Rock, economist at independent health care thinktank The Health Foundation, told Sky News. \"There is considerable variation across the NHS-particularly post-pandemic. Take delayed discharges, for example: some hospitals discharge patients much faster than others once they're ready to leave. Reducing this variation is essential to maximising the return on NHS investment,\" he said. There is no new data available on delayed discharges - where patients are kept for longer than they should be in hospital due to a lack of resource in social care or other services to move them on - as data is only published over winter. Data from last winter shows that the number of delayed discharges from hospital has barely budged, at just under 14,000 a day on average in January 2025 - with almost identical figures over the past three years. Thea Stein, chief executive of the Nuffield Trust independent health and social care thinktank, told Sky News that the lack of references to social care in the 10-year plan is \"disappointing\", as \"a proportion of people are stuck in every single hospital in this country because of issues to do with social care and the way in which it is funded,\" she said. Social care funding will be addressed separately in a review to be conducted by Dame Louise Casey, which may not reach a conclusion until towards the end of this parliament. Rising demand and funding challenges A growing and aging population is one reason demand for healthcare rises every year. Another reason is new technology and treatments, much of which the government is hoping to embrace. \"This is why budgets grow. It isn't purely waste, inefficiency, growing population, and growing ill health,\" Ms Stein explained. And while technology offers potential benefits, adopting it is often expensive. Recent analysis by the Nuffield Trust found that of Â£22.6bn additional funding between 2023/2024 and 2025/26, 19% will be spent on increased costs of care relating to a growing and aging population, as more people live with health conditions for longer. Higher demand for new treatments will take up 29% extra funding. The largest cost pressure, however, is inflation-related price rises, including recent pay settlements, which eat into more than half the total uplift in the budget. Funding allocated to the NHS for day-to-day spending in the latest spending review amounts to a real terms increase of Â£29bn annually by 2028/29, or a 2.7% rise from 2023/24 levels - the largest uplift for any department. However, while slightly above the average annual rise for spending reviews since 2010, it is below the 3.3% average increase in the five years leading up to the review, and only slightly higher than average increases from a decade earlier. And at that time the NHS was not undergoing major reforms. But the government says that \"the era of the NHS's answer always being 'more money, never reform' is over\", and that savings made by improving productivity and increasing population health will help them achieve their targets. The NHS will need to deliver a 2% increase in productivity per year - which means a 2% increase in activity across services from the same level of funding - to meet targets with the funding available. This is more than twice the level that has been achieved in recent years, according to The Health Foundation. Unexpected shocks - such as upcoming strikes or increasing costs of medicines, could make this more challenging.

The temperature will slowly start to decrease by Monday or Tuesday. \"It is going to be a hot one with little cloud around,\" Mr Eslick said. \"UV levels are going to be pretty high so anyone going to the [Wimbledon] finals should wear plenty of sun cream and stay hydrated as there is not going to be too much of a breeze to cool down. \"Pollen levels are also going to be high, so any hay fever sufferers should take medication to reduce that risk.\" He said the weekend would be very sunny and dry, with the wildfire risk classed as moderate, and advised those planning barbecues to make sure they extinguish them properly as the ground will be dry. Cold water shock warning RNLI water safety manager Ross Macleod warned those heading to the coast the seas can still be cold enough to trigger cold water shock, with waves and rip currents strong enough to overpower even the most experienced swimmers. He urged anyone in difficulty not to panic and advised: \"Tilt your head back, with your ears submerged. Relax and try to breathe normally. Move your hands and legs to help you stay afloat if you need to.\" \"Heading to the coast is a great way to have fun, relax and cool off in these high temperatures, but remembering this one piece of advice could save your life if you find yourself struggling in water,\" he said. \"We also encourage people to choose a lifeguarded beach and swim between the red and yellow flags, which is the area most closely monitored by the lifeguards.\""

        "Headline": "The Intelligence and Security Committee says there have been 15 Iran-backed murder or kidnap attempts on UK targets since the beginning of 2022 and August 2023.",
        "Content": " The threat of physical attacks by Iran on people living in the UK has increased \"significantly\" since 2022, according to a new report by parliament's intelligence watchdog.   Iran poses a \"wide-ranging, persistent and unpredictable threat\" to the UK, according to the Intelligence and Security Committee. It also said Iran's intelligence services were \"willing and able - often through third party agents - to attempt assassination within the UK, and kidnap from the UK\". The report said there have been 15 murder or kidnap attempts against British citizens or UK-based individuals since the beginning of 2022 and August 2023. The report authors add: \"Whilst Iran's activity appears to be less strategic and on a smaller scale than Russia and China, Iran poses a wide-ranging threat to UK national security, which should not be underestimated: it is persistent and crucially - unpredictable.\" The committee also says that while the threat is often focused on dissidents and other opponents to the regime, there is also an increased threat to Jewish and Israeli interests in the UK. The report warns that while Iran has not developed a nuclear weapon, it has taken steps towards that goal. It found that Iran had been \"broadly compliant\" with the 2015 Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), aimed at limiting its nuclear ambitions. But since Donald Trump withdrew from that deal in 2018, the report said the nuclear threat had increased and Tehran \"had the capability to arm in a relatively short period\". The UK government is also accused of \"fire-fighting\" rather than developing a real understanding of Iran. The report says: \"The government's policy on Iran has suffered from a focus on crisis management, driven by concerns over Iran's nuclear programme, to the exclusion of other issues. \"As one of our expert witnesses told the committee: 'Strategy is not a word that I think has crossed the lips of policy makers for a while, certainly not in relation to Iran'.\" The committee concluded its evidence-taking in August 2023, the result of two years of work, but the report authors say their conclusions \"remain relevant\". But the report authors questioned whether UK sanctions against individuals would \"in practice deliver behavioural change. Or in fact unhelpfully push Iran towards China\". Sima Sabet, a British-Iranian journalist, was forced to take protection after the security services discovered a plot to kill her. \"It was an assassination attempt so it's very serious. In March 2024 I was asked by counterterrorism police to leave my home, because they had credible information that my life was not safe where I was living, so I had to leave immediately,\" she told Sky News's home editor Jason Farrell. The same night, another Iranian journalist, Pouria Zeraati, was stabbed in the leg in London. Ms Sabet said fleeing her home had a \"massive impact\" on her life. \"You're not free to go out. I have to cover my face in the surrounding area where I live, I have to wear a mask even in 30 degrees weather, I don't do shopping in that neighbourhood, there are loads of your personal freedoms taken by being careful about not being attacked,\" she said. \"You do all of those recommendations and you are not sure if you are going to be attacked or not, and anytime anyone can stab you from the back. We are dealing with the state and dealing with the state means that whatever measures you take, they could be steps ahead of you.\" She described Iran as a \"terrorist state\", adding: \"They don't mind killing their opponents or journalists or anyone who is shedding light on the truth - and that was my only sin.\" In the wake of the report by parliament's intelligence watchdog, Ms Sabet called for the UK government to put \"meaningful pressure on Iran\". The committee also said the British government should consider proscribing the Iranian Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC), although some argue it would limit the UK's ability to talk to and influence Iran. Read more from Sky News:Who is Iran's supreme leader?Defiant Khamenei makes appearanceAnger in Iran over US and Israeli strikes Responding to the report, a UK government spokesperson said: \"The government will take action wherever necessary to protect national security, which is a foundation of our plan for change. \"We have already placed Iran on the enhanced tier of the foreign influence registration scheme and introduced further sanctions against individuals and entities linked to Iran, bringing the total number of sanctions to 450.\" Tehran rejected the committee's findings, claiming the report was \"unfounded, politically motivated and hostile\". The Iranian embassy in the UK said: \"The suggestion that Iran engages in or supports acts of physical violence, espionage, or cyber aggression on British soil or against British interests abroad, is wholly rejected. \"Such accusations are not only defamatory but also dangerous, fuelling unnecessary tensions and undermining diplomatic norms.\" British security services say Tehran uses criminal proxies to carry out its work in Britain. In December, two Romanians were charged after a journalist working for a Persian language media organisation in London was stabbed in the leg. In May, three Iranian men appeared in court charged with assisting Iran's foreign intelligence service and plotting violence against journalists. Earlier this year, the UK government said it would require the Iranian state to register everything it does to exert political influence in the UK, because of what it called increasingly aggressive activity."

        "Content": " A Palestinian activist who was detained for over three months in a US immigration jail after protesting against Israel is suing Donald Trump's administration for $20m (Â£15m) in damages. Lawyers for Mahmoud Khalil have filed a claim against the administration alleging he was falsely imprisoned, maliciously prosecuted and smeared as an antisemite as the government sought to deport him over his role in campus protests. The 30-year-old graduate student at Columbia University told Sky News's lead world presenter Yalda Hakim being detained by ICE agents in March \"felt like kidnapping\". He described \"plain-clothed agents and unmarked cars\" taking him \"from one place to another, expecting you just to follow orders and shackled all the time\", which he said was \"really scary\".  Mr Khalil said he was not presented with an arrest warrant and wasn't told where he was being taken. He said the detention centre he was taken to was \"as far from humane as it could be\" and \"a place where you have no rights whatsoever\". \"You share a dorm with over 70 men with no privacy, with lights on all the time, with really terrible food. You're basically being dehumanised at every opportunity. It's a black hole,\" he added. Mr Khalil said he would also accept an official apology from the Trump administration. The Trump administration celebrated Mr Khalil's arrest, promising to deport him and others whose protests against Israel it declared were \"pro-terrorist, antisemitic, anti-American activity\". Mr Khalil said after around 36 hours in captivity he was allowed to speak to his wife, who was pregnant at the time. \"These were very scary hours, I did not know what was happening on the outside. I did not know that my wife was safe,\" he said. Read more from Sky News:Starmer and Macron agree 'one in, one out' migrants return dealOfficers who confronted 'coward' killer win bravery award 'Absolutely absurd allegations' Mr Khalil said administration officials had made \"absolutely absurd allegations\" by saying he as involved in antisemitic activities and supporting Hamas. \"They are weaponising antisemitism, weaponising anti-terrorism in order to stifle speech,\" he said. \"What I was engaged in is simply opposing a genocide, opposing war crimes, opposing Columbia University's complicity in the war on Gaza.\" A State Department spokesperson said its actions toward Mr Khalil were fully supported by the law. Asked about missing the birth of his son while he was in prison, Mr Khalil said: \"I don't think there's any word that can describe the agony and the sadness that I went through, to be deprived from such a divine moment, from a moment that my wife and I had always dreamed about.\" Meanwhile, the deportation case against Mr Khalil is continuing to wind its way through the immigration court system."

        "Content": "\n          Europe correspondent\n              @adamparsons\n  We see the boat from a distance - the orange of the life jackets reflected in the rising sun. And as we draw closer, we can make out dozens of people crowded on board as it sets off from the shore, from a beach near Dunkirk. There is no sign of any police activity on the shore, and there are no police vessels in the water. Instead, the migrants crammed into an inflatable dinghy are being watched by us, on board a private boat, and the looming figure of the Minck, a French search and rescue ship that soon arrives. The dinghy meanders. It's not heading towards Britain but rather hugging the coast. A few of the passengers wave at us cheerfully, but then the boat starts to head back towards the shore. As it nears a different beach, we see a police vehicle - a dune buggy - heading down to meet it. Normal practice is for French police officers to slice through the material of any of these small boats that end up back on shore. Two police officers get out of the buggy and wait. A police helicopter arrives and circles above, performing a tight circle over the heads of the migrants. The police think they might be about to go back on to the beach; in fact, these passengers know that most of them are staying put. The boat stops a short distance from the shore and four people jump out. As they wade towards the beach, the boat turns and starts to head back out to sea. We see the two police officers approach these four men and have a brief conversation. They don't appear to check the bags they are carrying and, if they do question them about why they left the boat, it is the most cursory of conversations. In reality, these people probably don't speak French but they were almost certainly involved in arranging this crossing, which is against the law. But all four walk away, disappearing into the dunes at the back of the beach. Read more:Why do so many try to cross the Channel?Channel crossings rise by 50% in first half of 2025  We follow the boat as it chugs off in the direction of Britain, carrying around 50 people. The Minck returns to shadowing its progress, but its job is limited to offering help if the boat gets into trouble. Otherwise, if the engine keeps working, then this flimsy vessel will reach British waters in a few hours' time."

Project Hope said it happened this morning near Altayara Junction, in Deir al Balah, as patients waited for the clinic to open. The organisation's president called it a \"blatant violation of international humanitarian law, and a stark reminder that no one and no place is safe in Gaza\". \"No child waiting for food and medicine should face the risk of being bombed,\" added the group's project manager, Dr Mithqal Abutaha. \"It was a horrific scene. People had to come seeking health and support, instead they faced death.\" Operations at the clinic - which provides a range of health and maternity services - have been suspended.

The deaths come as an agreement over a 60-day truce hangs in the balance - with President Trump cautiously saying it could happen \"this week, or next week\". Elsewhere in Gaza, the Nasser Hospital reported another 21 deaths in airstrikes in Khan Younis and in the nearby coastal area of Muwasi. It said three children and their mother were among the dead. Israel said its troops have been dismantling more than 130 Hamas infrastructure sites in Khan Younis over the past week, including missile launch sites, weapons storage facilities and a 500m tunnel. On Wednesday, a soldier was shot dead when militants burst out of a tunnel and tried to abduct him, the military added.  Eighteen soldiers have been killed in the past three weeks - one of the deadliest periods for the Israeli army in months. A 22-year-old Israeli man was also killed on Thursday by two attackers in a supermarket in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, said the Magen David Adom emergency service. People on site reportedly shot and killed the attackers but information on their identity has so far not been released.

Negotiations over a proposed 60-day ceasefire are ongoing and President Trump reportedly put \"heavy\" pressure on Israel's leader, who visited the US this week. A major sticking point is said to be the status of the Israel Defence Forces (IDF) inside Gaza during the 60-day ceasefire and beyond, should it last longer. However, Sky News understands the Israeli government thinks the chances of a permanent truce are \"questionable\". More than 57,000 Palestinians have been killed in the war - more than half are women and children, according to Gaza's Hamas-controlled health ministry. Its figure does not differentiate between civilians and fighters. The war began in October 2023 after Hamas killed around 1,200 people in Israel and kidnapped 251 others. Some of them remain In Gaza and are a crucial part of ceasefire negotiations, which also include a planned surge in humanitarian aid into the strip."

Her comments came after she published a report on 1 July naming several large US companies that she claimed were involved, including some in the financial sector, big tech and the military industry. She has also been a strong supporter of the International Criminal Court's (ICC) arrest warrants against Israeli officials, including prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu, for allegations of war crimes in Gaza. Arrest warrants have also been issued by the ICC for Hamas leaders.

In a text message to Al Jazeera, she was quoted as dismissing the move as \"mafia-style intimidation techniques.\" Jurg Lauber, president of the UN Human Rights Council, said in a statement he \"regretted\" the US's decision to impose sanctions on Ms Albanese, adding: \"Special Rapporteurs are an essential instrument of the Council in fulfilling its mandate to promote and protect all human rights worldwide. \"I call on all UN Member States to fully cooperate with the Special Rapporteurs and mandate holders of the Council and to refrain from any acts of intimidation or reprisal against them.\" Read more:Gaza permanent ceasefire 'questionable', says Israeli governmentFootball coach Carlo Ancelotti handed one-year prison sentence Ms Albanese, an Italian human rights lawyer, has long been critical of the Israel Defence Forces (IDF), describing their actions in Gaza following the 7 October attacks as \"genocide\" - an accusation the Israeli government firmly denies.

        "Content": "\n          US correspondent\n              @Stone_SkyNews\n  The Israeli government believes the chances of achieving a permanent ceasefire in Gaza are \"questionable\". The pessimistic assessment, in a top-level Israeli government briefing given to Sky News, comes as the Israeli Prime Minister prepares to leave Washington DC after a four-day visit which had begun with the expectation of a ceasefire announcement. Benjamin Netanyahu will leave the US later today with the prospect of even a temporary 60-day ceasefire looking extremely unlikely this week. Within \"a week, two weeks - not a day\" is how it was framed in the background briefing late on Wednesday. Crucially, though, on the chances of the ceasefire lasting beyond 60 days, the framing from the briefing was even less optimistic: \"We will begin negotiations on a permanent settlement. But we achieve it? It's questionable, but Hamas will not be there.\"  Sky News has spoken to several Israeli officials at the top level of the government. None will be drawn on any of the details of the negotiations over concerns that public disclosure could jeopardise their chances of success. But I have been given a very clear understanding of Mr Netanyahu's thinking. \n                  Gaza permanent ceasefire 'questionable', says senior Israeli official\n                 \n                  IDF chief says conditions 'created' for Gaza ceasefire - as Trump says it could be 'this week or next'\n                 \n                  Trump applying 'heavy pressure' on Netanyahu to end war in Gaza\n                 The Israeli position is that a permanent ceasefire (beyond the initial 60 days, which itself is yet to be agreed) is only possible if Hamas lays down its arms. \"If they don't, we'll proceed [with the war],\" said a source. The major sticking point in the talks between Hamas and Israel is the status of the Israel Defence Forces (IDF) inside Gaza during the 60-day ceasefire and beyond, should it last longer. The latest Israeli proposal, passed to Hamas last week, included a map showing the proposed IDF presence inside Gaza during the ceasefire. Read more: What is the possible Gaza hostage and ceasefire deal? This was rejected by Hamas and by Trump's Middle East envoy, Steve Witkoff, who reportedly told the Israelis that the redeployment map \"looks like a Smotrich plan\", a reference to the extreme-right Israeli finance minister, Bezalel Smotrich. My briefing of Mr Netanyahu's position is that he has not shifted in terms of Israel's central stated war aims. The return of the hostages and eliminating Hamas are the key objectives. But in a hint of how hard it will be to reconcile the differences, it was clear from my briefing that no permanent ceasefire is possible in the Israeli government's view without the complete removal of Hamas as a political and military entity. Hamas is not likely to negotiate its way to oblivion. On the status of the Israeli military inside Gaza, a senior Israeli official told Sky News: \"We would want IDF in every square metre of Gaza, and then hand it over to someone.\" It was clear to me that Mr Netanyahu wants his stated position to be that his government has no territorial ambition for Gaza. One quote to come from my briefing, which I am only able to attribute to a senior Israeli official, says: \"[We] don't want to govern Gazaâ€¦ don't want to govern, but the first thing is, you have to defeat Hamas.\" Another clear indication of Mr Netanyahu's position - a quote from the briefing, attributable only to a senior Israeli official: \"You cannot have victory if you don't clear out all the fighting forces. \"You have to go into every square inch unless you are not serious about victory. I am. We are going to defeat them. Those who do not disarm will die. Those who disarm will have a life.\" On the future of Gaza, it's clear from my briefings that Mr Netanyahu continues to rule out the possibility of a two-state solution \"for the foreseeable future\". The Israeli government assessment is that the Palestinians are not going to have a state \"as long as they cling to that idea of destroying our state\". Read more:UN Special Rapporteur criticises IsraelWhy Netanyahu only wants a 60-day ceasefireTrump applying 'heavy pressure' on Netanyahu On the most controversial aspect of the Gaza conflict - the movement of the population - the briefing revealed that Mr Netanyahu's view is that 60% of Palestinians would \"choose to leave\" but that Israel would allow them to return once Hamas had been eliminated. \"It's not forcible eviction, it's not permanent eviction,\" a senior Israeli official said. Critics of Israel's war in Gaza say that any removal of Palestinians from Gaza, even if given the appearance of being \"voluntary\", is in fact anything but, because the strip has been so comprehensively flattened. Reacting to Israeli Defence Minister Katz's recent statement revealing a plan to move Palestinians into a \"humanitarian city\" in southern Gaza, and not let them out of that area, the official wouldn't be drawn, except to say: \"As a permanent arrangement? Of course not.\""

        "Content": " A Palestinian activist who was detained for over three months in a US immigration jail after protesting against Israel is suing Donald Trump's administration for $20m (Â£15m) in damages. Lawyers for Mahmoud Khalil have filed a claim against the administration alleging he was falsely imprisoned, maliciously prosecuted and smeared as an antisemite as the government sought to deport him over his role in campus protests. The 30-year-old graduate student at Columbia University told Sky News's lead world presenter Yalda Hakim being detained by ICE agents in March \"felt like kidnapping\". He described \"plain-clothed agents and unmarked cars\" taking him \"from one place to another, expecting you just to follow orders and shackled all the time\", which he said was \"really scary\".  Mr Khalil said he was not presented with an arrest warrant and wasn't told where he was being taken. He said the detention centre he was taken to was \"as far from humane as it could be\" and \"a place where you have no rights whatsoever\". \"You share a dorm with over 70 men with no privacy, with lights on all the time, with really terrible food. You're basically being dehumanised at every opportunity. It's a black hole,\" he added. Mr Khalil said he would also accept an official apology from the Trump administration. The Trump administration celebrated Mr Khalil's arrest, promising to deport him and others whose protests against Israel it declared were \"pro-terrorist, antisemitic, anti-American activity\". Mr Khalil said after around 36 hours in captivity he was allowed to speak to his wife, who was pregnant at the time. \"These were very scary hours, I did not know what was happening on the outside. I did not know that my wife was safe,\" he said. Read more from Sky News:Starmer and Macron agree 'one in, one out' migrants return dealOfficers who confronted 'coward' killer win bravery award 'Absolutely absurd allegations' Mr Khalil said administration officials had made \"absolutely absurd allegations\" by saying he as involved in antisemitic activities and supporting Hamas. \"They are weaponising antisemitism, weaponising anti-terrorism in order to stifle speech,\" he said. \"What I was engaged in is simply opposing a genocide, opposing war crimes, opposing Columbia University's complicity in the war on Gaza.\" A State Department spokesperson said its actions toward Mr Khalil were fully supported by the law. Asked about missing the birth of his son while he was in prison, Mr Khalil said: \"I don't think there's any word that can describe the agony and the sadness that I went through, to be deprived from such a divine moment, from a moment that my wife and I had always dreamed about.\" Meanwhile, the deportation case against Mr Khalil is continuing to wind its way through the immigration court system."

        "Content": "\n          US correspondent\n              @Stone_SkyNews\n  The Israeli government believes the chances of achieving a permanent ceasefire in Gaza are \"questionable\". The pessimistic assessment, in a top-level Israeli government briefing given to Sky News, comes as the Israeli Prime Minister prepares to leave Washington DC after a four-day visit which had begun with the expectation of a ceasefire announcement. Benjamin Netanyahu will leave the US later today with the prospect of even a temporary 60-day ceasefire looking extremely unlikely this week. Within \"a week, two weeks - not a day\" is how it was framed in the background briefing late on Wednesday. Crucially, though, on the chances of the ceasefire lasting beyond 60 days, the framing from the briefing was even less optimistic: \"We will begin negotiations on a permanent settlement. But we achieve it? It's questionable, but Hamas will not be there.\"  Sky News has spoken to several Israeli officials at the top level of the government. None will be drawn on any of the details of the negotiations over concerns that public disclosure could jeopardise their chances of success. But I have been given a very clear understanding of Mr Netanyahu's thinking. \n                  Gaza permanent ceasefire 'questionable', says senior Israeli official\n                 \n                  IDF chief says conditions 'created' for Gaza ceasefire - as Trump says it could be 'this week or next'\n                 \n                  Trump applying 'heavy pressure' on Netanyahu to end war in Gaza\n                 The Israeli position is that a permanent ceasefire (beyond the initial 60 days, which itself is yet to be agreed) is only possible if Hamas lays down its arms. \"If they don't, we'll proceed [with the war],\" said a source. The major sticking point in the talks between Hamas and Israel is the status of the Israel Defence Forces (IDF) inside Gaza during the 60-day ceasefire and beyond, should it last longer. The latest Israeli proposal, passed to Hamas last week, included a map showing the proposed IDF presence inside Gaza during the ceasefire. Read more: What is the possible Gaza hostage and ceasefire deal? This was rejected by Hamas and by Trump's Middle East envoy, Steve Witkoff, who reportedly told the Israelis that the redeployment map \"looks like a Smotrich plan\", a reference to the extreme-right Israeli finance minister, Bezalel Smotrich. My briefing of Mr Netanyahu's position is that he has not shifted in terms of Israel's central stated war aims. The return of the hostages and eliminating Hamas are the key objectives. But in a hint of how hard it will be to reconcile the differences, it was clear from my briefing that no permanent ceasefire is possible in the Israeli government's view without the complete removal of Hamas as a political and military entity. Hamas is not likely to negotiate its way to oblivion. On the status of the Israeli military inside Gaza, a senior Israeli official told Sky News: \"We would want IDF in every square metre of Gaza, and then hand it over to someone.\" It was clear to me that Mr Netanyahu wants his stated position to be that his government has no territorial ambition for Gaza. One quote to come from my briefing, which I am only able to attribute to a senior Israeli official, says: \"[We] don't want to govern Gazaâ€¦ don't want to govern, but the first thing is, you have to defeat Hamas.\" Another clear indication of Mr Netanyahu's position - a quote from the briefing, attributable only to a senior Israeli official: \"You cannot have victory if you don't clear out all the fighting forces. \"You have to go into every square inch unless you are not serious about victory. I am. We are going to defeat them. Those who do not disarm will die. Those who disarm will have a life.\" On the future of Gaza, it's clear from my briefings that Mr Netanyahu continues to rule out the possibility of a two-state solution \"for the foreseeable future\". The Israeli government assessment is that the Palestinians are not going to have a state \"as long as they cling to that idea of destroying our state\". Read more:UN Special Rapporteur criticises IsraelWhy Netanyahu only wants a 60-day ceasefireTrump applying 'heavy pressure' on Netanyahu On the most controversial aspect of the Gaza conflict - the movement of the population - the briefing revealed that Mr Netanyahu's view is that 60% of Palestinians would \"choose to leave\" but that Israel would allow them to return once Hamas had been eliminated. \"It's not forcible eviction, it's not permanent eviction,\" a senior Israeli official said. Critics of Israel's war in Gaza say that any removal of Palestinians from Gaza, even if given the appearance of being \"voluntary\", is in fact anything but, because the strip has been so comprehensively flattened. Reacting to Israeli Defence Minister Katz's recent statement revealing a plan to move Palestinians into a \"humanitarian city\" in southern Gaza, and not let them out of that area, the official wouldn't be drawn, except to say: \"As a permanent arrangement? Of course not.\""

Warning: Graphic images of the surgery below In a \"major leap\" towards using more robots in operating theatres, a machine trained on the videos of surgeries was able to remove a gallbladder from a life-like patient. The robot was said to have operated with the expertise of a skilled human surgeon, according to Johns Hopkins University researchers in the US, even during unexpected scenarios typical in real-life medical emergencies. The robot was able to respond to and learn from voice commands from the team, just like a novice surgeon working with a mentor. There were 17 tasks in the surgery, with the robot having to identify certain ducts and arteries and grab them precisely, strategically place clips, and sever parts with scissors. It was also able to adapt even when dye was introduced, which changed the appearance of the organs and tissue. \n                  Infected blood victims are 'waiting to die in limbo' - with hundreds still waiting for compensation\n                 \n                  Dates doctors will strike this summer announced\n                 \n                  Resident doctors vote in favour of strike action\n                 Axel Krieger, associate professor in mechanical engineering, said: \"This advancement moves us from robots that can execute specific surgical tasks to robots that truly understand surgical procedures. \"This is a critical distinction that brings us significantly closer to clinically viable autonomous surgical systems that can work in the messy, unpredictable reality of actual patient care.\" The work received federal government funding and was published in the journal Science Robotics. In 2022, a robot performed the first autonomous robotic surgery on a pig. However, it required specially marked tissue, operated in a highly controlled environment, and followed a rigid, pre-determined surgical plan. Mr Krieger said that phase was like teaching a robot to drive along a carefully mapped route. But the new system, he claimed, was \"like teaching a robot to navigate any road, in any condition, responding intelligently to whatever it encounters\". He added: \"To me, it really shows that it's possible to perform complex surgical procedures autonomously.\" Read more from Sky News:Dates doctors will strike this summer announcedWeight loss and diabetes jabs linked to potentially fatal side effect The new system, which uses the same machine learning architecture that powers ChatGPT, also adapts to a patient's anatomical features in real-time and works to correct itself. It can respond to spoken commands such as \"grab the gallbladder head\" or \"move the left arm a bit to the left\", and then learns from that feedback. Ji Woong Kim, a former postdoctoral researcher at Johns Hopkins who is now at Stanford University, said: \"Our work shows that AI models can be made reliable enough for surgical autonomy - something that once felt far-off but is now demonstrably viable.\" Although the robot took longer to perform the work than a human surgeon, the results were comparable to an expert surgeon, researchers said. The team will next train and test the system on more types of surgeries. Nuha Yassin, consultant colorectal surgeon and council member and lead for the future of surgery, robotics, and digital surgery at the Royal College of Surgeons of England (RCS England), said: \"It's always exciting to see new developments in surgical innovation, especially in areas like robotics and digital surgery. \"That said, the real test will be how safely and effectively the findings of this study can be translated into human trials. We need to make sure that progress doesn't come at the expense of patient safety.\""

A 20-year-old woman and two males, both aged 19, and another aged 17, were detained in London and the West Midlands as part of a National Crime Agency (NCA) operation. They were arrested at their homes on suspicion of Computer Misuse Act offences, blackmail, money laundering and participating in the activities of an organised crime group. Money blog: Cost of renting over owning home is a lot Electronic devices were seized from the suspects and are currently being analysed by forensic experts. M&S halted online orders, and shelves were empty in shops after the cyber attack on the retailer earlier this year.

The Co-op and Harrods were also subsequently targeted by hackers. Paul Foster, head of the NCA's National cybercrime unit described the arrests as a \"significant step\" in their investigation, which remains \"one of the agency's highest priorities\". He added: \"Our work continues, alongside partners in the UK and overseas, to ensure those responsible are identified and brought to justice.\" The arrests, which took place early on Thursday morning, were supported by officers from the West Midlands regional organised crime unit and the East Midlands special operations unit. Earlier this week, the chairman of M&S told MPs that the hack had been \"traumatic\" and like an \"out-of-body experience\". Archie Norman, however, refused to be drawn on whether the retailer had paid any ransom. \"We are not discussing any of the details of our interaction with the threat actor, including this subject, but that subject is fully shared with the NCA,\" he said.

Of those arrested, the 17-year-old British male and a 19-year-old Latvian male are from the West Midlands. Another 19-year-old man is from London and the woman from Staffordshire. An M&S spokesperson said: \"We welcome this development and thank the NCA for its diligent work on this incident.\" A Co-op representative commented: \"Hacking is not a victimless crime. Throughout this period, we have engaged fully with the NCA, and relevant authorities and are pleased on behalf of our members to see this had led to these arrests today.\""

The orginal Hermes Birkin, which had belonged to and was named after British actor and singer Jane Birkin, went under the hammer at Sotheby's in Paris on Thursday. It is also now the second most expensive fashion item ever sold. The bag was designed for Birkin, who starred in a number of French and British films from the 1960s onwards before her death in 2023. She happened to be seated next to Jean-Louis Dumas, then artistic director of Hermes, on an Air France flight in 1981. Carrying all her items in a wicker basket, she complained to Dumas that the handbags available at the time tended to be too small to fit all of her belongings. The pair began sketching designs on the back of a sick bag, and by 1985, Hermes had produced a prototype and presented it to Birkin, requesting her permission to name the new style in her honour. \n                  Ukraine war latest: Security agent shot dead in Kyiv; Trump says he warned Putin he would 'bomb s***' out of Moscow\n                 \n                  'Physical threat' from Iran on people living in UK has 'increased significantly', watchdog says\n                 \n                  Palestinian activist detained by ICE suing Trump administration for $20m\n                 It has since become a status symbol, worn by celebrities including Kate Moss, Victoria Beckham, Khloe Kardashian and Jennifer Lopez.

Sky News has learnt that RedBird IMI has tabled an offer for Whisper Group, which has been exploring a sale for several months. Sources said the auction process was at a critical stage with a buyer potentially being selected within days. Money latest: FTSE 100 hits record closing high RedBird IMI, which had hoped to take full control of The Daily Telegraph before a change of media ownership law meant that its Abu Dhabi state involvement had to be curtailed, already owns All3Media, the TV production giant behind a string of hit shows. However, its interest in Whisper is said to have been expressed through RedBird IMI rather than being conducted using All3Media as the acquirer. RedBird is now in the advanced stages of taking control of the Telegraph newspaper titles, with IMI restricted to owning a maximum 15% stake. \n                  Woman and three teenagers arrested over M&S, Co-op and Harrods cyber attacks\n                 \n                  Hermes Birkin handbag sells for Â£7.4m at auction\n                 \n                  US-listed Ulta Beauty swoops on high street chain Space NK\n                 The identities of the other bidders for Whisper were unclear on Thursday evening. Whisper Group was established in 2010 and won a BAFTA for its coverage of the Women's Euros in 2022. It is working with advisers at KPMG on a deal. Whisper is already 30%-owned by Sony Pictures Television, which acquired the stake in 2020. Sony replaced Channel 4's Indie Growth Fund as an investor in the business. A majority of the shares in Whisper are owned by its founders and management team. The company is best-known for its sports productions, and is responsible for Channel 4's Formula One coverage as well as international cricket, boxing and the Paralympics. Whisper employs about 300 people, and has operations in London, Cardiff, Manchester and Riyadh. Its chief executive, Sunil Patel, co-founded the producer alongside Mr Coulthard and Mr Humphrey. It is said to be plotting further expansion in sport in the form of bigger events and rightsholders, as well as in events, where its clients include Red Bull. Whisper is also focused on growing its presence in the US, where it currently works with Tom Brady's Religion of Sport, and the Middle East, where it is partnered with Neom and Saudi Pro League teams. Outside of sports rights, it has produced documentaries about Ben Stokes, the England Test cricket captain, and Sven-Goran Ericsson, the late England football manager. It has also diversified into entertainment programming, producing the Wheel Of Fortune gameshow hosted by Graham Norton. Its most recent accounts disclosed a Â£4.3m pre-tax profit for the year to 31 March, 2024. Both RedBird IMI and Whisper declined to comment."

The company, serving 1.8 million customers in the South West part of England, failed to meet its legal obligations in managing the wastewater treatment works and network, Ofwat said. South West Water did not have adequate management systems to ensure those legal obligations were met, including adequate oversight from its senior management team and board of directors, the regulator added. Money blog: Top chef reveals thing he hates about customers As a result of the failures, the company spilt wastewater when it should not have. Some customers of the company were subject to a boil water notice in May last year, which remained in place for eight weeks, with roughly 17,000 households told to boil their water before drinking.  The utility was said to be the worst offender for sewage discharge into shellfish waters, responsible for 13,000 sewage discharges, totalling 98,000 hours. \n                  Woman and three teenagers arrested over M&S, Co-op and Harrods cyber attacks\n                 \n                  Hermes Birkin handbag sells for Â£7.4m at auction\n                 \n                  US-listed Ulta Beauty swoops on high street chain Space NK\n                 Where's the money going?

It would have been Â£19m, 6.5% of South West Water's annual turnover, the watchdog added. A consultation is now open to the public to offer comments on Ofwat's decision before it is finalised. South West Water's parent company, Pennon, said: \"These investments will provide improvements for both customers and the environment alongside our K8 plans to tackle all storm overflows at our bathing and shellfish waters and our highest spilling sites.\""

From 28 July, Royal Mail will also be allowed to deliver second-class letters on alternate weekdays, Ofcom said. The post will still be delivered within three working days of collection from Monday to Friday. Money blog: Top chef reveals thing he hates about customers The proposals had already been raised by Ofcom after a consultation was announced in 2024, and the scale back was proposed early this year. Royal Mail had repeatedly failed to meet the so-called universal service obligation to deliver post within set periods of time. Those delivery targets are now being revised downwards. \n                  Woman and three teenagers arrested over M&S, Co-op and Harrods cyber attacks\n                 \n                  Hermes Birkin handbag sells for Â£7.4m at auction\n                 \n                  US-listed Ulta Beauty swoops on high street chain Space NK\n                 Rather than having to have 93% of first-class mail delivered the next day, 90% will be legally allowed. The target for second-class mail deliveries will be lowered from 98.5% to arrive within three working days to 95%. A review of stamp prices has also been announced by Ofcom amid concerns over affordability, with a consultation set to be launched next year. It's good news for Royal Mail and its new owner, the Czech billionaire Daniel Kretinsky. Ofcom estimates the changes will bring savings of between Â£250m and Â£425m.  A welcome change? Unsurprisingly, the company welcomed the announcement. \"It is good news for customers across the UK as it supports the delivery of a reliable, efficient and financially sustainable universal service,\" said Martin Seidenberg, the group chief executive of Royal Mail's parent company, International Distribution Services. \"It follows extensive consultation with thousands of people and businesses to ensure that the postal service better reflects their needs and the realities of how customers send and receive mail today.\" Citizens Advice, however, doubted whether services would improve as a result of the changes. \"Today, Ofcom missed a major opportunity to bring about meaningful change,\" said Tom MacInnes, the director of policy at Citizens Advice. \"Pushing ahead with plans to slash services and relax delivery targets in the name of savings won't automatically make letter deliveries more reliable or improve standards.\" Acknowledging long delays \"where letters have taken weeks to arrive\", Ofcom said it set Royal Mail new enforceable targets so 99% of mail has to be delivered no more than two days late. Changing habits Less than a third of letters are sent now than 20 years ago, and it is forecast to fall to about a fifth of the letters previously sent. According to Ofcom research, people want reliability and affordability more than speedy delivery. Royal Mail has been loss-making in recent years as revenues fell.

In response to Ofcom's changes, a government spokesperson said: \"The public expects a well-run postal service, with letters arriving on time across the country without it costing the earth. With the way people use postal services having changed, it's right the regulator has looked at this. \"We now need Royal Mail to work with unions and posties to deliver a service that people expect, and this includes maintaining the principle of one price to send a letter anywhere in the UK\". Ofcom said it has told Royal Mail to hold regular meetings with consumer bodies and industry groups to hear their experiences implementing the changes."

Sky News has learnt that Dame Jayne-Anne Gadhia, who now holds a string of chairmanships, will become independent chair of Ovo as part of a boardroom shake-up at its parent company. Sources said her appointment would be announced later on Thursday, alongside those of Miguel Gaspar Silva and Andy Cox to the board of Kaluza, Ovo Group's technology arm. Money blog: Top chef reveals thing he hates about customers As part of the overhaul, Justin King, the former J Sainsbury chief, is stepping down as group chairman, insiders said. Dame Jayne-Anne's appointment comes at a crucial time for Ovo, which Sky News revealed last month is in the early stages of merger talks with Scottish Power. It is also separately running a process with potential investors to secure an additional Â£300m of financial backing. \n                  Octopus Energy to pay Â£1.5m over prepayment meter billing error\n                 \n                  Octopus Energy sparks Â£10bn demerger of tech arm Kraken\n                 \n                  Energy future: Paying up front should lead to tangible savings ahead\n                 In a statement released to Sky News, Ovo said Dame Jayne-Anne's \"understanding of consumer markets and regulatory frameworks will be instrumental in guiding OVO's continued evolution and navigating the dynamic energy landscape\". The Kaluza board appointments are designed to help the Ovo-controlled division accelerate its international expansion. Last weekend, Sky News revealed that Kraken Technologies, which is owned by rival Octopus Energy, is being prepared for a demerger, which could value it at about Â£10bn. Kaluza recently bought Beige Technologies, an Australian energy software specialist, in order to strengthen its presence in the Asia-Pacific region. Read more from Sky News:Royal Mail to scrap second-class post on some daysWarning a pub a day to close this yearUS-listed Ulta Beauty swoops on high street chain Space NK Founded by Stephen Fitzpatrick, the entrepreneur who now owns London's Kensington Roof Gardens, Ovo's shareholders include the private equity firm Mayfair Equity Partners, Morgan Stanley Investment Management and Mitsubishi Corporation, the Japanese conglomerate. Under Mr Fitzpatrick, who launched Ovo in 2009, the company positioned itself as a challenger brand offering superior service to the industry's established players. Ovo's transformational moment came in 2020, when it bought the retail supply arm of SSE, transforming it overnight into one of Britain's leading energy companies. Its growth has not been without difficulties, however, particularly in relation to its challenged relationship with Ofgem and a torrent of customer complaints about overcharging. The group is now run by David Buttress, who was briefly Boris Johnson's cost-of-living tsar after leaving the top job at Just Eat, as its chief executive. Key to Ovo's longer-term valuation will be the performance of Kaluza, which was set up to license software to other energy suppliers and provides customers with smart electric vehicle charging and heat pumps, as well as intelligent energy solutions to commercial customers. Ovo announced last year that AGL Energy, one of Australia's biggest energy suppliers, had bought a 20% stake in Kaluza at a $500m (Â£395m) valuation. The British energy company has also entered the electric vehicle car charging sector under the brand Charge Anywhere, adding tens of thousands of public charging points across the UK."

According to the British Beer and Pub Association (BBPA), an estimated 378 venues will shut down across England, Wales and Scotland. This would amount to more than 5,600 direct job losses, the industry body warns. It has called for a reduction in the cumulative tax and regulatory burden for the hospitality sector - including cutting business rates and beer duty. The body - representing members that brew 90% of British beer and own more than 20,000 pubs - said such measures would slow the rate at which bars are closing. BBPA chief executive Emma McClarkin said that while pubs are trading well, \"most of the money that goes into the till goes straight back out in bills and taxes\". \"For many, it's impossible to make a profit, which all too often leads to pubs turning off the lights for the last time,\" she said. \"When a pub closes, it puts people out of a job, deprives communities of their heart and soul, and hurts the local economy.\" She urged the government to \"proceed with meaningful business rates reform, mitigate these eye-watering new employment and EPR (extended producer responsibility) costs, and cut beer duty\". \"We're not asking for special treatment, we just want the sector's rich potential unleashed,\" she added.

The West of England and Wales has seen the highest number of arrests over the last year for illegal workers outside of London. \"It is a problem... we're tackling it,\" Murad Mohammed, from Immigration Enforcement, says. He covers all the devolved nations. \"This is just one of the operations going on around the country, every day of the week, every month of the year.\" Just outside the Cabot Circus shopping complex, we stop a young Albanian man who arrived in the UK on the back of a truck. He's on an expensive and fast-looking e-bike, with a new-looking Just Eat delivery bag. He says he just uses it for \"groceries\" - but the officer isn't buying it. He's arrested, but then bailed instantly. We don't know the specifics of his case, but one officer tells me this suspected offence won't count against his asylum claim. Such is the scale of the problem - the backlog, loopholes and the complexity of cases - that trying to keep on top of it feels impossible. This is one of many raids happening across the UK as part of what the government says is a \"blitz\" targeting illegal working hotspots. Angela Eagle, the border security and asylum minister, joins the team for an hour at one of Bristol's retail parks, scattered with fast food chains and, therefore, delivery bikes. She says arrests for illegal working are up over the last year by 51% from the year before, to more than 7,000. \"If we find you working, you can lose access to the hotel or the support you have [been] given under false pretences,\" she said. \"We are cracking down on that abuse, and we intend to keep doing so.\" There are reports that asylum seekers can rent legitimate delivery-driver accounts within hours of arriving in the country - skipping employment legality checks. Uber Eats, Deliveroo, and Just Eat all told Sky News they're continuing to strengthen the technology they use to remove anyone working illegally. But a new Border Security Bill, working its way through Parliament, could see companies fined Â£60,000 for each illegal worker discovered, director disqualifications and potential prison sentences of up to five years. \"I had them all in to see me last week and I told them in no uncertain terms that we take a very tough line on this kind of abuse and they've got to change their systems so they can drive it out and off their platforms,\" the minister tells me.

For some of those who arrive, a bike and a phone provide a way to repay debts to gang masters.

And he has got a win today - he's got President Macron to agree a deterrent deal. Politics latest: Macron stokes undiplomatic Brexit row You remember the Conservatives were trying the Rwanda plan to deter people from coming by sending them back to Rwanda, a third country, if they came here illegally. What the prime minister has agreed with President Macron today is a big deal. It's a one in, one out deal.

It might be just a handful of people being sent back, maybe just under a thousand or so by the end of the year. But they will hopefully, for the prime minister, scale it up and it could become a real deterrent.

Polling out this morning by Portland suggests four in 10 voters who are planning on going to Reform would go back to Labour if the prime minister tackles small boats and drives down the crossings. There is a real political imperative for him to try to start to resolve this problem. It's going to count at the ballot box - immigration is a top-three issue in this country when it comes to voters."

She admitted her view on ID cards may be seen as \"politically incorrect\", with the issue dividing Labour MPs. \n                  Sir Keir Starmer should use Angela Rayner more effectively as she is popular with public, Harriet Harman says\n                 \n                  'A policy Labour never liked - but may not be able to scrap'\n                 \n                  Starmer condemned for telling MP 'she talks rubbish'\n                 However, Sir Tony has been a long-time supporter and more than 40 Labour MPs from three groups on Tuesday urged ministers to introduce digital IDs to help control the migration system and improve public services. \"I think now with the digital situation, and people have so much digital ID - I mean, it depends on whether or not you think the state is going to actually overstep the mark and oppress people,\" Baroness Harman said. \"But I think there are things that the government has to do that people want them to do, which digital ID will enable them to do.\" The Home Office is currently rolling out eVisas for all people in the UK on a visa and is creating new digital systems for checking visa compliance. Last month, Downing Street said the government is exploring introducing a \"BritCard\" for all citizens after the Labour Together thinktank proposed one to stop people overstaying their visas, exploitative work and rogue landlords. A paper from the group said it would cost up to Â£400m to build a system and around Â£10m a year to administer as a free-to-use phone app."

On the third and final day of the Anglo-French summit in the UK, the British prime minister and French president announced a trial of the scheme that will allow small boat migrants to be sent back to France. Politics latest: Warning to fix migration or risk 'extreme right wing parties'  In return, Britain would accept the same number of asylum seekers - who try to come to the UK by a safe route - as those who are returned to France. Speaking next to Emmanuel Macron at a news conference in north west London, Sir Keir Starmer said it would come into force in a matter of \"weeks\". \"Migrants arriving via small boat will be detained and returned to France in short order,\" he said. \"In exchange for every return, a different individual will be allowed to come here via a safe route - controlled and legal - subject to strict security checks, and only open to those who have not tried to enter the UK illegally.\" \n                  Nigel Farage hits back at Emmanuel Macron after French president sparks fresh Brexit row\n                 \n                  Is migration helping or hurting the UK?\n                 \n                  In pictures: Princess of Wales, Elton John and Mick Jagger at King's state banquet for Macron\n                 The prime minister said the arrangement would begin as a \"pilot\", with reports suggesting that just 50 people per week will be sent to France back across the Channel. However, neither Mr Macron nor Sir Keir mentioned any figures in the news conference. The announcement of the deal comes as part of Mr Macron's high-stakes state visit to the UK - the first of a European leader since Brexit. This morning, dozens of people arrived in the UK on a dinghy in scenes witnessed by Sky News. So far more than 21,000 people have arrived in the UK via small boats so far this year - a rise of almost 50% on the number crossing in 2024.  Both leaders have described the Channel crossings as a mutual burden and crisis that must be tackled with co-operation. Hailing their partnership, Sir Keir said that while there was \"no silver bullet\" to tackle the issue, the pair could \"finally turn the tables\" with \"a united effort, new tactics and a new level of intent\". He said the new deal would show people that attempting to cross the Channel in small boats would be \"in vain\", adding: \"The jobs they have been promised in the UK will no longer exist because of the nationwide crackdown we're delivering on illegal working which is on a completely unprecedented scale.\" Mr Macron also welcomed the deal reached with the UK, saying it was \"a good agreement\". Brexit creates crossing 'incentive' He suggested Brexit was to blame in the uptick in the number of crossings, arguing that the UK's departure from the European Union meant there was no way for people to be returned to mainland Europe after people crossed the Channel. He was referring to the Dublin regulation, which the UK was signatory to when it was a member of the EU, but is no longer. \"Many people in your country explained that Brexit would make it possible to fight more effectively against illegal immigration,\" Mr Macron said.

We've had no confirmation on how many people will be sent back to France, but Sky News understands that the government expects around 50 people per week will be returned when the programme starts. The deal is subject to sign off from European lawyers before it starts. In terms of the \"how\", people who cross the Channel will be detained and have their details taken. Those picked for the pilot will be kept in detention, told their claim for asylum is inadmissible, and sent back to France. There will be a way for people to appeal this, but cases will get reviewed. When someone is sent back to France, a person with a legitimate asylum claim - who has not crossed by small boat before - will be sent the other way. The costs for the pilot will come from existing Home Office budgets. It's not clear how long the pilot will last, but it will be kept under ongoing review. His words sparked condemnation from Reform UK leader Nigel Farage, who said he did not think \"this so-called deal will make any difference at all\" - citing the European Convention on Human Rights, which the UK is a signatory to. Speaking to reporters from Westminster, he said: \"If we even try to deport people across the Channel we will run straight into the European Convention on Human Rights as written into British law, in the human rights act. The lawyers will have a field day and will find lots of reasons why people can't be deported. \"Nobody who crosses the English Channel illegally, in a boat, should ever be given refugee status, should ever be given leave to remain, and should be deported and if we did that, it would stop within a fortnight.\" The French president also praised the prime minister for committing to reducing the \"pull factors\" that attract people to the UK from France - including the flexible labour market. During a Q&A session, Sir Keir was asked whether the scheme would be effective given the large numbers of people who are making the dangerous journey across the Channel. He responded by saying that if the pilot proved to be successful, \"the numbers will ramp up\". However, he refused to say how the pilot would select who might be returned to France, arguing it might \"undermine\" how the scheme would operate."

        "Content": "Heat-related deaths in England and Wales could rise 50-fold by the 2070s as climate change collides with an ageing population, a study has warned. It comes as areas of the UK face another heatwave, with temperatures over the next few days forecast to be above average and exceed 30C (86F) for many. Annual heat-related deaths might climb into the tens of thousands in the coming decades, according to research by University College London (UCL) and the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. They say today's baseline figure of 634 heat deaths a year could hit 10,317 in the 2050s and, in a worst-case scenario, 34,027 in the 2070s. The prediction is based on 4.3C of warming and minimal efforts to adapt. Older people are more vulnerable to extreme heat, and the research warns the population of England and Wales is expected to age significantly over the next five decades. A more optimistic scenario - where the rise is only 1.6C from pre-industrial levels and major efforts are made to adapt - still envisages 3,007 deaths a year in the 2050s and 4,592 in the 2070s. \n                  UK weather: Country set to have new heatwave - with temperatures over 30C in some areas, Met Office forecasts\n                 \n                  Heatwave likely killed 263 people in London, study estimates\n                 \n                  Weather: What is a 'heat dome' - and how long is it set to affect the UK?\n                 The experts want more action to adapt homes and cities.

Researchers warn 2022's exceptionally hot summer - when it hit 40.3C (104F) and 2,985 excess heat-related deaths were recorded - could be the \"new normal\" by the 2050s. \"Over the next 50 years, the health impacts of a warming climate are going to be significant,\" said Dr Clare Heaviside from UCL. \"We can mitigate their severity by reducing greenhouse gas emissions and with carefully planned adaptations, but we have to start now.\" Read more on Sky News:Man stabbed to death near five-star London hotelHeat health alerts and hosepipe ban issued The study warns there could be between 21 to 32 extra hot days annually in the 2060s under scenarios with the least warming, and up to 64 to 73 in the most pessimistic case. Commenting on the study, Dr Akshay Deoras, from the University of Reading, said: \"If floods and storms are the loud alarms of climate change, extreme heat is its silent killer. \"It is disproportionately lethal, often going unnoticed until it's too late.

A 20-year-old woman and two males, both aged 19, and another aged 17, were detained in London and the West Midlands as part of a National Crime Agency (NCA) operation. They were arrested at their homes on suspicion of Computer Misuse Act offences, blackmail, money laundering and participating in the activities of an organised crime group. Money blog: Cost of renting over owning home is a lot Electronic devices were seized from the suspects and are currently being analysed by forensic experts. M&S halted online orders, and shelves were empty in shops after the cyber attack on the retailer earlier this year. The initial hack into the retailer's systems took place in April through \"sophisticated impersonation\" involving a third party. \n                  Cyber attack on M&S involved 'sophisticated impersonation', chairman says\n                 \n                  Patient's death linked to cyber attack on NHS, hospital trust says\n                 \n                  Businesses urged to strengthen cyber defences amid increase in Iran-adjacent attacks\n                 Disruption is expected to continue at the retailer until the end of this month.  The Co-op and Harrods were also subsequently targeted by hackers. Paul Foster, head of the NCA's National cybercrime unit described the arrests as a \"significant step\" in their investigation, which remains \"one of the agency's highest priorities\". He added: \"Our work continues, alongside partners in the UK and overseas, to ensure those responsible are identified and brought to justice.\" The arrests, which took place early on Thursday morning, were supported by officers from the West Midlands regional organised crime unit and the East Midlands special operations unit. Earlier this week, the chairman of M&S told MPs that the hack had been \"traumatic\" and like an \"out-of-body experience\". Archie Norman, however, refused to be drawn on whether the retailer had paid any ransom. \"We are not discussing any of the details of our interaction with the threat actor, including this subject, but that subject is fully shared with the NCA,\" he said. It is estimated that the cyber attack will cost M&S up to Â£300m this year.

Of those arrested, the 17-year-old British male and a 19-year-old Latvian male are from the West Midlands. Another 19-year-old man is from London and the woman from Staffordshire. An M&S spokesperson said: \"We welcome this development and thank the NCA for its diligent work on this incident.\" A Co-op representative commented: \"Hacking is not a victimless crime. Throughout this period, we have engaged fully with the NCA, and relevant authorities and are pleased on behalf of our members to see this had led to these arrests today.\""

Warning: Graphic images of the surgery below In a \"major leap\" towards using more robots in operating theatres, a machine trained on the videos of surgeries was able to remove a gallbladder from a life-like patient. The robot was said to have operated with the expertise of a skilled human surgeon, according to Johns Hopkins University researchers in the US, even during unexpected scenarios typical in real-life medical emergencies. The robot was able to respond to and learn from voice commands from the team, just like a novice surgeon working with a mentor. There were 17 tasks in the surgery, with the robot having to identify certain ducts and arteries and grab them precisely, strategically place clips, and sever parts with scissors. It was also able to adapt even when dye was introduced, which changed the appearance of the organs and tissue. \n                  Infected blood victims are 'waiting to die in limbo' - with hundreds still waiting for compensation\n                 \n                  Dates doctors will strike this summer announced\n                 \n                  Resident doctors vote in favour of strike action\n                 Axel Krieger, associate professor in mechanical engineering, said: \"This advancement moves us from robots that can execute specific surgical tasks to robots that truly understand surgical procedures. \"This is a critical distinction that brings us significantly closer to clinically viable autonomous surgical systems that can work in the messy, unpredictable reality of actual patient care.\" The work received federal government funding and was published in the journal Science Robotics. In 2022, a robot performed the first autonomous robotic surgery on a pig. However, it required specially marked tissue, operated in a highly controlled environment, and followed a rigid, pre-determined surgical plan. Mr Krieger said that phase was like teaching a robot to drive along a carefully mapped route. But the new system, he claimed, was \"like teaching a robot to navigate any road, in any condition, responding intelligently to whatever it encounters\". He added: \"To me, it really shows that it's possible to perform complex surgical procedures autonomously.\" Read more from Sky News:Dates doctors will strike this summer announcedWeight loss and diabetes jabs linked to potentially fatal side effect The new system, which uses the same machine learning architecture that powers ChatGPT, also adapts to a patient's anatomical features in real-time and works to correct itself. It can respond to spoken commands such as \"grab the gallbladder head\" or \"move the left arm a bit to the left\", and then learns from that feedback. Ji Woong Kim, a former postdoctoral researcher at Johns Hopkins who is now at Stanford University, said: \"Our work shows that AI models can be made reliable enough for surgical autonomy - something that once felt far-off but is now demonstrably viable.\" Although the robot took longer to perform the work than a human surgeon, the results were comparable to an expert surgeon, researchers said. The team will next train and test the system on more types of surgeries. Nuha Yassin, consultant colorectal surgeon and council member and lead for the future of surgery, robotics, and digital surgery at the Royal College of Surgeons of England (RCS England), said: \"It's always exciting to see new developments in surgical innovation, especially in areas like robotics and digital surgery. \"That said, the real test will be how safely and effectively the findings of this study can be translated into human trials. We need to make sure that progress doesn't come at the expense of patient safety.\""

        "Content": "Researchers say they have found a \"powerful double weapon\" that could help cancer patients keep their hair during chemotherapy. The new method combines scalp cooling - where patients use cold caps to reduce hair loss from cancer drugs - with a lotion, comprised of antioxidants - some of which are found in red grapes. Hailed as a \"milestone,\" researchers at Sheffield Hallam University also pinpointed the optimal temperature for scalp cooling to be most effective for keeping hair. Cold caps are already used by some cancer patients during chemotherapy to help minimise the amount of hair they lose. They work by restricting blood flow to the scalp, which reduces the amount of medication reaching the hair follicles. But the team at Sheffield Hallam University found that cooling the scalp to 18C (64.4F) can prevent hair follicle damage, while 26C may not be enough, and that topical antioxidants could \"transform the ability of cooling to protect\" against hair loss. Dr Nik Georgopoulos, an associate professor of cell biology and Transforming Lives fellow at Sheffield Hallam, told PA: \"Chemotherapy drugs are drugs that kill rapidly dividing cancer cells, but they cannot discriminate between cancer cells and rapidly dividing normal cells in the body. \"At the base of our hair follicles are these rapidly dividing cells, or keratinocytes, that constantly grow and they end up forming the actual hair.\" For the study, published in Frontiers of Pharmacology, hair follicles were isolated from the scalp and grown in the lab before being treated with chemotherapy to study the impact. \"We show that they die,\" Dr Georgopoulos said. \"The cells that are rapidly dividing and grow the hair, they will die because of the toxicity of chemotherapy. \"But if you cool them, they are protected, and I don't mean just protected - prevented from dying. So if cooling is used while the hair follicles are grown in the lab, it can completely prevent the toxicity.\" The associate professor noted, however, that \"there is a catch - you have to use the right temperature,\" but added that \"our research has shown that cooling can slow down the cells, stops them from dividing - protection\". He said that any issues with temperature could also be compensated with a topical location containing antioxidants like resveratrol, found in the likes of red grapes and peanuts, and dietary supplement N-Acetylcysteine. Dr Georgopoulos described the combination as a \"powerful double weapon\". Read more:Blood test to 'revolutionise' NHS cancer treatmentHeatwave likely killed 263 in London, say scientistsNew leukaemia treatment hailed as 'milestone' Dr Georgopoulos has also been working with Huddersfield-based business Paxman Scalp Cooling, which created a device that circulates coolant through a specially designed cooling cap. The cooling cap is worn for half an hour before chemotherapy treatment commences, during treatment, and for up to 90 minutes after all the drugs have been given. Researchers are now hoping to trial the technique using the Paxman device and are currently finalising the antioxidants to be used."

        "Content": "\n          Business and economics reporter\n              @taaffems\n South West Water has agreed to pay a Â£24m penalty for wastewater spillages, the water regulator said.   The company, serving 1.8 million customers in the South West part of England, failed to meet its legal obligations in managing the wastewater treatment works and network, Ofwat said. South West Water did not have adequate management systems to ensure those legal obligations were met, including adequate oversight from its senior management team and board of directors, the regulator added. Money blog: Top chef reveals thing he hates about customers As a result of the failures, the company spilt wastewater when it should not have. Some customers of the company were subject to a boil water notice in May last year, which remained in place for eight weeks, with roughly 17,000 households told to boil their water before drinking.  The utility was said to be the worst offender for sewage discharge into shellfish waters, responsible for 13,000 sewage discharges, totalling 98,000 hours. \n                  Woman and three teenagers arrested over M&S, Co-op and Harrods cyber attacks\n                 \n                  Hermes Birkin handbag sells for Â£7.4m at auction\n                 \n                  US-listed Ulta Beauty swoops on high street chain Space NK\n                 Where's the money going? But rather than being fined, the Â£24m is a penalty, with the sum going towards investment in the water system. Investment of Â£20m will target sewage and wastewater flows in \"environmentally sensitive areas\" or within focused community areas, Ofwat said.

If the payment had not been agreed, a penalty would have been applied, and the money would have gone to the Treasury.â€¯ The Â£24m investment package secured is larger than the penalty would have been, Ofwat said. It would have been Â£19m, 6.5% of South West Water's annual turnover, the watchdog added. A consultation is now open to the public to offer comments on Ofwat's decision before it is finalised. South West Water's parent company, Pennon, said: \"These investments will provide improvements for both customers and the environment alongside our K8 plans to tackle all storm overflows at our bathing and shellfish waters and our highest spilling sites.\""

        "Content": "Salt Path author Raynor Winn has said claims she lied about her story are \"highly misleading\" and called suggestions her husband made up his illness \"utterly vile\". A report in The Observer disputed key aspects of the hit book, billed as an \"inspiring and life-affirming true story\" about a couple's coastal trek. Winn released a lengthy statement denying the paper's claims and shared medical letters apparently sent to her husband, Moth, that appear to support a diagnosis for a rare neurological condition, Corticobasal Degeneration (CBD). One letter mentions his prior \"CBS [Corticobasal Syndrome] diagnosis\", while another concludes he has \"an atypical form\" of CBD. The author said accusations he lied about having CBD/CBS are false and have \"emotionally devastated\" him. \"I have charted Moth's condition with such a level of honesty, that this is the most unbearable of the allegations,\" Winn wrote on her website. The Observer claimed to have spoken to experts who were \"sceptical\" about elements of his story, such as a \"lack of acute symptoms and his apparent ability to reverse them\". PSPA, a charity that supports people with CBD, ended their relationship with the family following The Observer's claims. Winn said she had never suggested walking was \"some sort of miracle cure\" and that there can be \"symptoms for many years before they finally reach a diagnosis\". \"Even then, many sufferers' symptoms present in an atypical way,\" she wrote. \"They might not present with the same symptoms, occurring in the same order, or with the same severity.\" Winn also posted the letters on Instagram and said they are grateful Moth's condition is slow-progressing. She clarified it is now commonly referred to by specialists as CBS, \"which describes the symptoms observed during life\". The bestselling book was also recently released as a film, starring Jason Isaacs and Gillian Anderson, charting the couple's 630-mile trek along the Cornish, Devon, and Dorset coast - a journey sparked by the devastation of losing their house. The Observer claimed the portrayal of a failed investment in a friend's business wasn't true, rather they lost their home after Raynor Winn embezzled money from her employer, Martin Hemming, and had to borrow to pay it back and avoid police action. Winn's statement said the dispute with Mr Hemmings wasn't the reason they lost their home - but admitted she may have made \"mistakes\" while in the job. \"For me it was a pressured time,\" she wrote. \"It was also a time when mistakes were being made in the business. Any mistakes I made during the years in that office, I deeply regret, and I am truly sorry.\" She admitted being questioned by police but said she wasn't charged. Winn added: \"I reached a settlement with Martin Hemmings because I did not have the evidence required to support what happened. The terms of the settlement were willingly agreed by both parties.\" Read more from Sky News:Heat health alert and hosepipe ban as third heatwave hitsAnalysis reveals cost of renting over owning home The author reiterated the book's version of events: that the loss of their home in Wales stemmed from an investment in a friend's property portfolio that went sour. Her statement goes into legal detail about how it transpired and admits - as The Observer suggested - that the couple at one point tried to raffle the house. However, the author said they \"quickly realised it was a mistake as it clearly wasn't going to work. We cancelled it and refunded the few participants.\" The 63-year-old also denied having any outstanding debts and said it was \"blatantly untrue\" the couple were hiding behind pseudonyms after The Observer quoted people who said they knew them by the surname Walker. \"Winn is my maiden name and like most women who have married I've used both my maiden name, Winn, and married name, Walker,\" said the statement. She also explained she preferred the first name Raynor, rather than her birth name Sally Ann, so took that as her pen name; while Moth is an abbreviation of her husband's name, Timothy. \"The legal names we use on our bank records, our utility bills etc. Our friends and neighbours use Sal and Tim interchangeably with Ray and Moth - there is nothing hiding in our names,\" she said. Sky News has contacted The Observer for a response to Winn's statement. Raynor Winn had been scheduled to make numerous appearances over the summer, performing with Saltlines, her collaboration with Gigspanner Big Band. However, the band has since announced on social media that she will no longer be taking part in the tour. She was also scheduled to take part in various Q&As, conversations, writing courses and festivals."

        "Content": "A handbag has sold for â‚¬8.6m (Â£7.4m) - becoming the most valuable ever sold at auction. The orginal Hermes Birkin, which had belonged to and was named after British actor and singer Jane Birkin, went under the hammer at Sotheby's in Paris on Thursday. It is also now the second most expensive fashion item ever sold. The bag was designed for Birkin, who starred in a number of French and British films from the 1960s onwards before her death in 2023. She happened to be seated next to Jean-Louis Dumas, then artistic director of Hermes, on an Air France flight in 1981. Carrying all her items in a wicker basket, she complained to Dumas that the handbags available at the time tended to be too small to fit all of her belongings. The pair began sketching designs on the back of a sick bag, and by 1985, Hermes had produced a prototype and presented it to Birkin, requesting her permission to name the new style in her honour. \n                  Ukraine war latest: Security agent shot dead in Kyiv; Trump says he warned Putin he would 'bomb s***' out of Moscow\n                 \n                  'Physical threat' from Iran on people living in UK has 'increased significantly', watchdog says\n                 \n                  Palestinian activist detained by ICE suing Trump administration for $20m\n                 It has since become a status symbol, worn by celebrities including Kate Moss, Victoria Beckham, Khloe Kardashian and Jennifer Lopez. Morgane Halimi, Sotheby's global head of handbags and fashion, said: \"The spectacular sale of the original Hermes Birkin today at Sotheby's Paris marks an important milestone in the history of fashion and the luxury industry more widely. \"It is a startling demonstration of the power of a legend and its capacity to ignite the passion and desire of collectors seeking exceptional items with unique provenance, to own its origin.\" The previous world record for a handbag was the Hermes white Himalaya niloticus crocodile diamond retourne Kelly 28, which sold in 2021 for $513,040 (Â£380,000). The most expensive fashion item ever sold was the pair of ruby red slippers worn by Judy Garland in the film The Wizard of Oz, which fetched $32.5m (Â£24m) in 2024."

Sky News has learnt that RedBird IMI has tabled an offer for Whisper Group, which has been exploring a sale for several months. Sources said the auction process was at a critical stage with a buyer potentially being selected within days. Money latest: FTSE 100 hits record closing high RedBird IMI, which had hoped to take full control of The Daily Telegraph before a change of media ownership law meant that its Abu Dhabi state involvement had to be curtailed, already owns All3Media, the TV production giant behind a string of hit shows. However, its interest in Whisper is said to have been expressed through RedBird IMI rather than being conducted using All3Media as the acquirer. RedBird is now in the advanced stages of taking control of the Telegraph newspaper titles, with IMI restricted to owning a maximum 15% stake. \n                  Woman and three teenagers arrested over M&S, Co-op and Harrods cyber attacks\n                 \n                  Hermes Birkin handbag sells for Â£7.4m at auction\n                 \n                  US-listed Ulta Beauty swoops on high street chain Space NK\n                 The identities of the other bidders for Whisper were unclear on Thursday evening. Whisper Group was established in 2010 and won a BAFTA for its coverage of the Women's Euros in 2022. It is working with advisers at KPMG on a deal. Whisper is already 30%-owned by Sony Pictures Television, which acquired the stake in 2020. Sony replaced Channel 4's Indie Growth Fund as an investor in the business. A majority of the shares in Whisper are owned by its founders and management team. The company is best-known for its sports productions, and is responsible for Channel 4's Formula One coverage as well as international cricket, boxing and the Paralympics. Whisper employs about 300 people, and has operations in London, Cardiff, Manchester and Riyadh. Its chief executive, Sunil Patel, co-founded the producer alongside Mr Coulthard and Mr Humphrey. It is said to be plotting further expansion in sport in the form of bigger events and rightsholders, as well as in events, where its clients include Red Bull. Whisper is also focused on growing its presence in the US, where it currently works with Tom Brady's Religion of Sport, and the Middle East, where it is partnered with Neom and Saudi Pro League teams. Outside of sports rights, it has produced documentaries about Ben Stokes, the England Test cricket captain, and Sven-Goran Ericsson, the late England football manager. It has also diversified into entertainment programming, producing the Wheel Of Fortune gameshow hosted by Graham Norton. Its most recent accounts disclosed a Â£4.3m pre-tax profit for the year to 31 March, 2024. Both RedBird IMI and Whisper declined to comment."
