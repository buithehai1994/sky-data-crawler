        "Content": "Donald Trump has said he will speak to Vladimir Putin and Volodymyr Zelenskyy separately on Monday in a bid to secure a ceasefire deal between Russia and Ukraine. The US president made the announcement on Truth Social - shortly after the Ukrainian president condemned Russia for the \"deliberate killing of civilians\" after a drone hit a bus in north-eastern Ukraine. Mr Trump said he will speak to Mr Putin over the phone. He will then talk with Mr Zelenskyy and \"various members of NATO\", he wrote. In an all-caps post, he said: \"HOPEFULLY IT WILL BE A PRODUCTIVE DAY, A CEASEFIRE WILL TAKE PLACE, AND THIS VERY VIOLENT WAR, A WAR THAT SHOULD HAVE NEVER HAPPENED, WILL END. GOD BLESS US ALL!!!\" The Ukrainian town of Bilopillia today declared a period of mourning lasting until Monday after nine people were killed in a Russian drone attack - which occurred just hours after Kyiv and Moscow held peace talks. Seven others were injured, Ukrainian authorities said. The bus was evacuating civilians from a frontline area when the drone hit, the country's national police said.  A \"father, mother and daughter\" were among the dead, Mr Zelenskyy said, writing on Telegram: \"All the deceased were civilians. And the Russians could not have failed to understand what kind of vehicle they were targeting.\" The attack has also been condemned by British Foreign Secretary David Lammy, who said he was \"appalled\". \"If Putin is serious about peace, Russia must agree to a full and immediate ceasefire, as Ukraine has done,\" he wrote on X. Representatives for Kyiv and Moscow met for direct peace talks in Istanbul, Turkey, just hours before the drone attack. While the discussions - which were not attended by the Mr Putin or Mr Zelenskyy - did not result in a truce, both countries agreed to exchange 1,000 prisoners in their biggest swap yet. Ukraine's intelligence chief, Kyrylo Budanov, said on national television the exchange could happen as early as next week.  Russia 'threatened eternal war' at peace talks After a Ukrainian official yesterday said Russia made \"unacceptable\" demands during the discussions, a source from the Kyiv delegation has now told Sky News that Moscow threatened \"eternal war\". Separately, a senior Kyiv official said Russia's proposed ceasefire terms included the full withdrawal of troops from four regions of Ukraine: Donetsk, Zaporizhzhia, Kherson and Luhansk. Moscow also called for international recognition that those regions and Crimea - annexed in 2014 - are Russian and for Ukraine to become a neutral state, with no allied troops stationed there, they said. The Kremlin declined to comment on the matter.

And so I tell you, faced with President Putin's cynicism, I am sure that President Trump, mindful of the credibility of the United States, will react.\" The EU is working on a new package of sanctions against Moscow, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said."

        "Content": " Israel and Hamas said ceasefire talks have resumed in Qatar - even as Israeli forces ramped up a bombing campaign and mobilised for a massive new ground assault. Earlier, the Israeli military said it had been \"conducting extensive strikes and mobilising troops\" as part of preparations to expand operations in Gaza. Israel's defence minister Israel Katz said Hamas had \"refused to discuss negotiations without a cessation of the war\", but after the airstrikes and the mobilisation of forces the militant group's representatives \"have agreed to sit in a room and seriously discuss the deal\". \"Israel emphasises that if the talks do not progress, the [military] operation will continue,\" he added. A Hamas source told Sky News that ceasefire talks began in Doha on Saturday morning. Hamas 'keen to exert all the effort needed' Hamas official Taher al Nono told Reuters news agency that the two sides were involved in discussions without \"pre-conditions\". He added Hamas was \"keen to exert all the effort needed\" to help mediators make the negotiations a success. More than 150 people have been killed in Israeli strikes in the last 24 hours, according to the Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza. This week has been one of the deadliest phases of bombardment since a truce collapsed in March and marked a significant escalation in Israel's offensive. The Israeli military's preparations to expand operations in Gaza have included the build-up of tanks and troops along the border. It is part of \"Operation Gideon Chariot\", which Israel says is aimed at defeating Hamas and getting its hostages back. Trump speaks with freed hostage An Israeli defence official said earlier this month that the operation would not be launched before Donald Trump concluded his visit to the Middle East. The US president ended his trip on Friday, with no apparent progress towards a new peace deal. Ahead of his visit, Hamas released American-Israeli hostage Edan Alexander as part of ongoing efforts to achieve a permanent ceasefire. On Saturday evening, the White House released a video of the US president speaking with the 21-year-old, who was believed to be the last living American hostage in Gaza. Mr Alexander is heard telling Mr Trump that \"you're the only reason I'm here\" in the clip, and said: \"You saved my life.\" The US president then tells him: \"For a while, we thought we lost you, actually. A lot of people thought you were not around anymore... \"Just really honoured, and you're an American, and we love you, and we're going to take good care of you.\"  Meanwhile on Saturday, leaders at the annual summit of the Arab League in Baghdad said they were trying to reach a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas in Gaza. They also promised to contribute to the reconstruction of the territory once the war stops. The meeting comes two months after Israel ended a ceasefire reached with the Hamas militant group. Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on 5 May that Israel was planning an expanded, intensive offensive against Hamas as his security cabinet approved plans that could involve seizing Gaza and controlling aid. This week, Israel said it had bombed the European Hospital because it was home to an underground Hamas base, but Sky News analysis has cast doubt on its evidence. Israel's goal is the elimination of Hamas, which attacked southern Israel on 7 October 2023, killing around 1,200 people and seizing about 250 hostages. Its military response has killed more than 53,000 people, according to the Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza, which does not differentiate between civilians and combatants."

        "Content": "\n          News correspondent\n              @ashnahurynag\n A 15-year-old boy who was operated on twice by a now unlicensed Great Ormond Street surgeon is living with \"continuous\" pain. Finias Sandu has been told by an independent review the procedures he underwent on both his legs were \"unacceptable\" and \"inappropriate\" for his age. The teenager from Essex was born with a condition that causes curved bones in his legs. Aged seven, a reconstructive procedure was carried out on Finias's left leg, lengthening the limb by 3.5cm. A few years later, the same operation was carried out on his right leg which involved wearing an invasive and heavy metal frame for months. He has now been told by independent experts these procedures should not have taken place and concerns have been raised over a lack of imaging being taken prior to the operations. His doctor at London's prestigious Great Ormond Street Hospital was former consultant orthopaedic surgeon Yaser Jabbar. Sky News has spoken to others he treated. Mr Jabbar also did not arrange for updated scans or for relevant X-rays to be conducted ahead of the procedures. The surgeries have been found to have caused Finias \"harm\" and left him in constant pain. \"The pain is there every day, every day I'm continuously in pain,\" he told Sky News. \"It's not something really sharp, although it does get to a certain point where it hurts quite a lot, but it's always there. It just doesn't leave, it's a companion to me, just always there.\" Read more:Girl who had leg amputated suffered harm during surgeon's careChild, 11, in wheelchair after surgeon's operationsHospital accused of 'covering up' concerns about suspended surgeon Care of over 700 patients being assessed Mr Jabbar rescinded his UK medical licence in January last year after working at Great Ormond Street between 2017 and 2022. The care of his 700-plus patients is being assessed, with some facing corrective surgery, among them Finias. \"Trusting somebody is hard to do, knowing what they have done to me physically and emotionally, you know, it's just too much to comprehend for me,\" he said. \"It wasn't something just physically, like my leg pain and everything else. It was emotionally, because I put my trust in that specific doctor. My parents and I don't really understand the more scientific terms, we just went by what he said.\" Doctors refused to treat Finias because of his surgeries Finias and his family relocated to their native Romania soon after the reconstructive frame was removed from his right leg in the summer of 2021. The pain worsened and they sought advice from doctors in Romania, who refused to treat Finias because of the impact of his surgeries. Dozens of families seeking legal claims His mother Cornelia Sandu is \"furious\" and feels her trust in the hospital has been shattered. They are now among dozens of families seeking legal claims. Cyrus Plaza from Hudgell Solicitors is representing the family. He said: \"In cases where it has been identified that harm was caused, we want to see Great Ormond Street Hospital agreeing to pay interim payments of compensation for the children, so that if they need therapy or treatment now, they can access it.\" Finias is accessing therapy and mental health support as he prepares for corrective surgery later in the year. A spokesperson for Great Ormond Street Hospital told Sky News: \"We are deeply sorry to Finias and his family, and all the patients and families who have been impacted. \"We want every patient and family who comes to our hospital to feel safe and cared for. We will always discuss concerns families may have and, where they submit claims, we will work to ensure the legal process can be resolved as quickly as possible.\" Service not 'safe for patients' Sky News has attempted to contact Mr Jabbar. An external review into the wider orthopaedic department at the hospital began in September 2022. It was commissioned after the Royal College of Surgeons warned the hospital's lower limb reconstruction service was not \"safe for patients or adequate to meet demand\". The investigation is expected to be completed by the end of the year."

        "Content": "\n          Arts and entertainment reporter\n              @BethanyMinelle\n Austria has won Eurovision 2025, with Austrian-Filipino singer-songwriter JJ taking the glass microphone. The 24-year-old singer - whose real name is Johannes Pietsch - originally trained as a countertenor, and represented his country with the operatic ballad Wasted Love, dramatically staged on a storm-tossed ship. The song, which was not dissimilar to that of last year's winner Nemo, told the story of unrequited love, with a techno breakdown near the end. Austria has won Eurovision twice before, the last time in 2014 with Conchita Wurst's pop hit Rise Like A Phoenix. Israel's Yuval Raphael, who survived the 7 October 2023 attacks which were the catalyst for Israel's ongoing offensive in Gaza, was the runner-up with piano ballad New Day Will Rise, performed in Hebrew, French and English. The singer was left \"shaken and upset\", after two pro-Palestinian protesters rushed towards her during her grand final performance in the St Jakobshalle arena in Basel, Switzerland. Organisers confirmed a backstage crew member was hit with paint but was not hurt. A spokesman for the Swiss Broadcasting Corporation SRG SSR said: \"At the end of the Israeli performance, a man and a woman tried to get over a barrier onto the stage. \n                  Eurovision Song Contest 2025 in pictures\n                 \n                  Eurovision 2025: Sex, survival and saunas - all the songs to look out for\n                 \n                  Clodagh Rodgers: Eurovision star and face of Bisto gravy dies\n                 \"They were stopped. One of the two agitators threw paint and a crew member was hit. The crew member is fine and nobody was injured. The man and the woman were taken out of the venue and handed over to the police.\" A Basel police spokesman later said: \"The organiser handed the two people over to the police. The police checked the two people and then released them. It is now up to the organiser to decide whether to press charges.\" Israel has won Eurovision four times. Just as the grand final began broadcasting, Spanish broadcaster shared a message of Palestinian support which read: \"When human rights are at stake, silence is not an option. Peace and justice for Palestine.\" The broadcaster had already received a warning from the European Broadcasting Union (EBU) over political statements reported by Israeli broadcaster Kan. The EBU said in response to the latter incident: \"We can confirm that we have spoken to RTVE regarding this matter and made it clear that commentators are expected to maintain neutrality within the broadcasts of the Eurovision Song Contest.\" During the evening, there were also pro-Palestinian protests near the centre of Basel, as well as a small group nearby protesting with Israeli flags. Israeli National Security Council had issued a warning to Israeli civilians in the city to keep a low profile during the competition. In a change from last year's contest in Malmo, Sweden, the ban on certain flags being waved by the audience was relaxed which meant Palestinian symbols could be seen in the arena.

However, for the second year running, the UK received no points in the public score. The UK has had five wins at Eurovision, but in recent years has struggled to rank, with the exception being Sam Ryder with Space Man in 2022, who came second. Last year, Olly Alexander was placed 18th at Malmo, and Mae Muller was second to last the previous year in Liverpool. The Eurovision grand final took place on Friday evening, with the winner from among the 26 performing nations decided by a mix of public voting and points from national juries. The four-hour-long show was presented by an all-female team - stand-up comedian Hazel Brugger, TV presenter Michelle Hunziker and Eurovision veteran Sandra Studer. There were performances by previous Eurovision runners-up Croatia's Baby Lasagna and Finland's Kaarija, as well as last year's winner Nemo during the night. Estonia's Tommy Cash came third in the contest - just one point behind Israel - with his controversial dance-popsong Espresso Macchiato, which has irritated many Italians by stereotyping the entire nation. Sweden had been widely tipped to win with their sauna-themed entry Bara Bada Bastu (Just Sauna), but ended up coming fourth. Ukraine, who have made a strong showing each since they first entered the competition in 2003, and who won in 2023, came ninth. Last year, protests and politics overshadowed the singing event amid the outbreak of war in Gaza, with some calling for Israel to be kicked out of the contest. Eden Golan's Hurricane ended up finishing in fifth place. Last year also saw The Netherlands' act Joost Klein kicked out of the competition by the EBU over alleged verbal threats to a female production worker, which he denied. This year, Dutch singer Claude, finished in 12th place with his song C'est La Vie. Next year's competition, Eurovision's 70th, will be held in Austria."

        "Content": "One person has died in a bomb explosion near a reproductive health clinic in California which the FBI said was an \"intentional act of terrorism\". The incident took place in Palm Springs, a city two hours east of Los Angeles, and is being investigated as a possible car explosion. The city's mayor Ron DeHarte said one person died in the blast, adding that the bomb was \"either in or near\" a vehicle. The deceased's identity is not known, Palm Springs police said. Dr Maher Abdallah, who runs the American Reproductive Centers clinic, told the Associated Press his facility was damaged but all staff were safe and accounted for. The explosion damaged the office space where the practice conducts patient consultations, but the IVF lab and stored embryos were unharmed, he added. \"I really have no clue what happened,\" he said. \"Thank God today happened to be a day that we have no patients.\" In a statement posted on Facebook, the clinic said it was \"heartbroken\" to learn someone died in the explosion and added: \"Our deepest condolences go out to the individuals and families affected.\" It continued: \"Our mission has always been to help build families, and in times like these, we are reminded of just how fragile and precious life is. \"In the face of this tragedy, we remain committed to creating hope - because we believe that healing begins with community, compassion, and care.\" The clinic will be fully operational on Monday, it added. \"This moment has shaken us - but it has not stopped us. We will continue to serve with strength, love, and the hope that brings new life into the world,\" the statement concluded. The Palm Springs city government said in a post on Facebook that the explosion happened on North Indian Canyon Drive, near East Tachevah Drive, before 11am local time (6pm GMT). A burned-out car can be seen in a parking lot behind the building in aerial footage. The blast caved in the clinic's roof and blew debris across four lanes of the road. Another person said he was inside a cannabis dispensary nearby when he felt a massive explosion. Nima Tabrizi said: \"The building just shook, and we go outside and there's massive cloud smoke.\" Investigators from the FBI and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives are travelling to the scene to help assess what happened. On Saturday evening, Akil Davies, head of the FBI's Los Angeles branch, said the explosion was an \"intentional act of terrorism\". He added that authorities were still working to confirm the identity of the person who died at the scene. While he did not directly say whether that person was the suspect, he said authorities were not searching for a suspect. A White House official also told Sky's US partner network NBC News that US President Donald Trump was monitoring the situation. California governor Gavin Newsom has been briefed on the explosion, his press office said."

        "Content": "\n          Europe correspondent\n              @adamparsons\n  We are ushered down some stairs beside a Lebanese restaurant and along a path next to a small garden. We walk past some guards, into a private dining room and there is a man in a hoodie, offering a hand. This is George Simion, just 38 years old but now sitting on the threshold of remarkable power. He is the populist politician who has made it to the run-off to become Romania's president. The disruptor up against the mayor of Bucharest, Nicusor Dan. The radical against the centrist. Simion apologises for dressing down and tells me, with a laugh, that he will be wearing a suit \"when I meet President Zelenskyy and President Trump\". The name Trump will crop up a few times in our conversation. On the table next to him is a red Make America Great Again baseball hat. Simion makes no secret of his admiration for Donald Trump. So what, I ask, does he take from the leadership style of the American president? \"His way of speaking the truth,\" he replies. \"His way of defending one's country and one's interests. \"We are all, in Europe and America, fed up with politically correct people who undermine our freedom and opinions. \"We are fighting for freedom of speech and free election. We are fighting for God against evil.\" The remarkable thing about this election is that, really, it shouldn't be happening. It is six months since the initial presidential election was annulled, after the country's highest court decided that the leading candidate, the nationalist Calin Georgescu, should be disqualified due to allegations of electoral interference by Russia. Simion could be the one to prosper from that. But - and here's the twist - he's also been one of the loudest critics of the decision to cancel the election. He blames \"the deep state\" for trying to subvert democracy, and insists the move has failed. \"They managed to build a big statue for Mr Georgescu to make him a big victim,\" says Simion. \"Clearly the majority of the Romanian people now hate their guts for how they manage to govern the country. \"We are getting poorer and poorer and that's why we have so many Romanians in Great Britain.\" And in the biggest twist of all, he now talks of bringing Georgescu into government, should he win the presidency. So, I ask, would he really offer the job of prime minister to Georgescu - a man who once told me that COVID wasn't real and that he was being undermined by a global conspiracy led by George Soros? \"If we have a landslide victory tomorrow - and if Calin Georgescu wants it - then yes, of course. \"They tried to ban me, kick me out, bribe me - with lots and lots of cash. I'm not for sale. I'm doing this for my country and for honour.\"  He said he would follow Trump's lead on Ukraine, which neighbours Romania, and played down any suggestion that he would extend a hand of friendship to Moscow. \"Russia left really bad memories here, and many scars, and we don't believe that in the foreseeable future we would have good relations,\" he told me. He did support peace negotiations between Russia and the United States, insisting they would need to include security guarantees, particularly to protect countries such as Romania and the Baltic states.

Simion told me he regretted Britain's decision to leave the European Union, but said he could understand \"why you want to get away from Ursula von der Leyden and Emmanuel Macron\". Romania, he emphasised, had worked hard to get a place within the EU and NATO \"so we are here to stay and won't be going anywhere\". But he said the EU should focus on being an economic project - the idea of a more federal Europe seems to horrify him. \"We would like more and more cooperation with you British,\" he said. \"We feel bad that we are not in the same single market and we share lots of history together and we want you Brits back. \"I learned much more about British culture and civilisation during the English lessons in my school than many of your high school kids do. So we hope to have the same future as part of the free world.\" 'It will be a landslide' Our time is up, but before I leave he shows me a chart on the wall, marked with predictions from his team. The most optimistic has him winning with 57% of the vote, but he disagrees. \"It will be a landslide,\" he tells me. \"At least 60%.\" He may not have decades of experience, but he does not lack for confidence."

Eighteen people have died in Kentucky and at least 10 were in a critical condition, its governor Andy Beshear said, while seven have died in Missouri and two in northern Virginia. The weather system also saw tornadoes tear through Wisconsin, leaving hundreds of thousands of people without power. In the Missouri city of St Louis, five people were confirmed dead and more than 5,000 homes were damaged, mayor Cara Spencer said on Saturday. The storm system originally hit Scott County, 130 miles south of St Louis, on Friday, killing two people, Sheriff Derick Wheetley said. The devastation that ensued saw roofs torn off buildings, blown-out windows, toppled trees, and power lines. St Louis mayor Cara Spencer said: \"Our city is grieving tonight. The loss of life and the destruction is truly, truly horrendous.\" Dozens of people are believed to have been injured and in hospital, but the exact numbers in Missouri have not been confirmed. Kentucky officials described the situation there as a \"mass casualty event\" after the weather system tore across Laurel County late on Friday. At least 17 people were killed in Laurel County when a twister touched down around midnight, governor Mr Beshear said on Saturday afternoon on social media. Among the dead was a firefighter with the Laurel County Fire Department who was fatally injured while responding to the havoc caused by the weather. Several people were taken to hospital, buildings were damaged, and a car flipped over on a busy highway, local officials reported. Laurel County Sheriff's Office spokesman Gilbert Acciardo said rescuers had \"been on the ground all night looking for possible survivors\".

        "Content": "\n          News correspondent\n              @ashnahurynag\n A 15-year-old boy who was operated on twice by a now unlicensed Great Ormond Street surgeon is living with \"continuous\" pain. Finias Sandu has been told by an independent review the procedures he underwent on both his legs were \"unacceptable\" and \"inappropriate\" for his age. The teenager from Essex was born with a condition that causes curved bones in his legs. Aged seven, a reconstructive procedure was carried out on Finias's left leg, lengthening the limb by 3.5cm. A few years later, the same operation was carried out on his right leg which involved wearing an invasive and heavy metal frame for months. He has now been told by independent experts these procedures should not have taken place and concerns have been raised over a lack of imaging being taken prior to the operations. His doctor at London's prestigious Great Ormond Street Hospital was former consultant orthopaedic surgeon Yaser Jabbar. Sky News has spoken to others he treated. Mr Jabbar also did not arrange for updated scans or for relevant X-rays to be conducted ahead of the procedures. The surgeries have been found to have caused Finias \"harm\" and left him in constant pain. \"The pain is there every day, every day I'm continuously in pain,\" he told Sky News. \"It's not something really sharp, although it does get to a certain point where it hurts quite a lot, but it's always there. It just doesn't leave, it's a companion to me, just always there.\" Read more:Girl who had leg amputated suffered harm during surgeon's careChild, 11, in wheelchair after surgeon's operationsHospital accused of 'covering up' concerns about suspended surgeon Care of over 700 patients being assessed Mr Jabbar rescinded his UK medical licence in January last year after working at Great Ormond Street between 2017 and 2022. The care of his 700-plus patients is being assessed, with some facing corrective surgery, among them Finias. \"Trusting somebody is hard to do, knowing what they have done to me physically and emotionally, you know, it's just too much to comprehend for me,\" he said. \"It wasn't something just physically, like my leg pain and everything else. It was emotionally, because I put my trust in that specific doctor. My parents and I don't really understand the more scientific terms, we just went by what he said.\" Doctors refused to treat Finias because of his surgeries Finias and his family relocated to their native Romania soon after the reconstructive frame was removed from his right leg in the summer of 2021. The pain worsened and they sought advice from doctors in Romania, who refused to treat Finias because of the impact of his surgeries. Dozens of families seeking legal claims His mother Cornelia Sandu is \"furious\" and feels her trust in the hospital has been shattered. They are now among dozens of families seeking legal claims. Cyrus Plaza from Hudgell Solicitors is representing the family. He said: \"In cases where it has been identified that harm was caused, we want to see Great Ormond Street Hospital agreeing to pay interim payments of compensation for the children, so that if they need therapy or treatment now, they can access it.\" Finias is accessing therapy and mental health support as he prepares for corrective surgery later in the year. A spokesperson for Great Ormond Street Hospital told Sky News: \"We are deeply sorry to Finias and his family, and all the patients and families who have been impacted. \"We want every patient and family who comes to our hospital to feel safe and cared for. We will always discuss concerns families may have and, where they submit claims, we will work to ensure the legal process can be resolved as quickly as possible.\" Service not 'safe for patients' Sky News has attempted to contact Mr Jabbar. An external review into the wider orthopaedic department at the hospital began in September 2022. It was commissioned after the Royal College of Surgeons warned the hospital's lower limb reconstruction service was not \"safe for patients or adequate to meet demand\". The investigation is expected to be completed by the end of the year."

The government is set to host EU leaders in London on Monday as part of its efforts to \"reset\" relations post-Brexit.

The prime minister has appeared to signal a youth mobility deal could be possible, telling The Times that while freedom of movement is a \"red line\", youth mobility does not come under this. His comment comes after Kaja Kallas, the EU's high representative for foreign affairs, said on Friday work on a defence deal was progressing but \"we're not there yet\".

        "Content": "\n          North of England correspondent\n              @ShingiMararike\n Goodison Park has been the home of Everton FC since 1892, hosting more top-flight football than any other stadium in the country. This afternoon marks the end of an era, with the club's men's team playing their final game at the ground they call the \"grand old lady\". As the club and the community prepared for the game against Southampton, many people were cherishing their connections to Goodison Park. Those included groups of fans who were already gathering outside the 39,414-seat stadium, either to try to secure last-second tickets, or to take some of the last stadium tours of the season. One of those people on the tour was Rachel, who has seen some of Everton's greatest triumphs in recent memory, including their 1995 FA Cup Final win against Manchester United. Read more from Sky NewsFive stabbed at music eventRapper charged with GBHMeet the teenage British boxer fighting in Bahrain \"It's an emotional place,\" she said. \"Goodison, even on bad days, it's a place to be. It's just everything we do and everything we believe. Goodison's always been there.\" Rachel also has a collection of tattoos related to the club, including their Latin motto on her right arm \"Nil Satis Nisi Optimum\", which means \"nothing but the best is good enough\". She says her love of the club was passed down by her parents, both of whom are buried in Anfield Cemetery on a plot that the stadium overlooks. Inside Goodison Park they were also preparing for a farewell, with the players' shirts already lined up in the dressing room, while the groundsmen tended to the pitch. As one of the few old-style stadiums remaining in the top flight, Goodison Park is well-known for its atmosphere, including on raucous derby days against their city rivals Liverpool. One person who knows what it's like to play and score at the ground is Graham Stuart, who spent four years at Everton, from 1993 to 1997. \"It's an incredible atmosphere,\" he said. \"It can be tough at times. You need a bit of steel about you to play at Goodison Park, the fans will tell you if you're not playing well, but they'll also give you a chance and back you all the way. If I could do it again, I'd love to.\" While Stuart speaks to us, another Everton legend, Peter Reid, walks past. Reid, who won European and domestic honours with the club in the 1980s, will be among the host of former players invited to the ground for today's game, along with Stuart. A stone's throw away from Goodison Park, another place preparing for today was the Winslow Inn, a pub even older than the ground itself. The walls are adorned with pictures of some of Everton's greatest players, while the manager, Dave Bond, is a lifelong fan himself, who travelled over from Ireland to manage the business in 2014. New stadium named after law firm sponsor The club's new ground at Bramley Moore Dock will be named the Hill Dickinson Stadium with the naming rights going to a Liverpool-based law firm. But beyond that multimillion-pound financial arrangement, there will be fans hoping to keep their matchday routines alive, which is why the Winslow Inn will put on a shuttle bus next season for fans travelling from there to the new stadium. Bond summed up the thoughts of many, when he said today will be special but bittersweet. \"This is just going to be on another level of emotion,\" he said. \"It's going to be momentous, it'll be a joyous occasion, but right at the very end when it's time to go through those turnstiles one last time, it's going to be absolutely heartbreaking for so many people.\" But after that heartbreak will be a fresh start and another piece of history for what was the first purpose-built football stadium in England. Goodison Park will become the home of Everton's women's team, making it the largest dedicated women's football stadium in the UK."

It's the south London club's first major trophy - and third time lucky after losing two previous finals they have played in. The win also means Palace have qualified for next season's Europa League. Man City piled on the pressure in the first half but Eberechi Eze put his side 1-0 up with the game's only goal in the 16th minute. Pep Guardiola's side were given a chance to equalise when they were awarded a penalty in the 33rd minute, after Tyrick Mitchell's sliding tackle missed the ball and took out Bernado Silva instead. With half-time approaching, man-of-the-hour Henderson saved Omar Marmoush's spot kick. The most controversial moment of the match came prior to the penalty save, when Henderson handled the ball outside his area to prevent Erling Haaland running through into the box. A VAR review deemed the ball was going away from the goal and the keeper escaped a red card. Speaking after the match, Henderson said on ITV he \"didn't know\" the review was for him. \"The ball had come into the box so I wasn't sure what they were doing it for,\" he said. \"Who cares, it doesn't matter.\" In the second half, it briefly seemed the south London team had gone 2-0 up after a 58th-minute strike from Daniel Munoz - but the goal was quickly ruled offside. Palace then held onto their 1-0 lead until the final whistle, which came after an agonising 10 minutes of injury time. Oliver Glasner's team were the underdogs despite Manchester City having had a difficult season in the Premier League. Guardiola's side also lost to their neighbours and rivals Manchester United in last year's cup final. There was a pointed exchange between the Man City manager and Palace goalkeeper Henderson after the match. Henderson said of the exchange: \"I just went to shake his hand but obviously I think he was disappointed with the time wasting. \"I said, 'You got your 10 minutes you were wanting'. No hard feelings.\" 'It's all about spirit'  At the trophy presentation, the Prince of Wales handed the triumphant Palace players their winners' medals and the FA cup as the team's anthem, Glad All Over, blasted out of the Wembley tannoy system. Goalscorer Eze said he had \"no words\" as he celebrated with his team mates. \"I can only thank God,\" he told ITV. \"This is special, this is what dreams are made of, for this club as well. Who would have thought we could do it? \"We've made history today. The tactics were good but it's all about spirit. That's energy, that's everyone fighting together and doing what we had to do today.\""

        "Content": " Tributes have been paid to two firefighters and a business owner who died in a huge blaze in Oxfordshire. Flowers have been placed near the entrance to Bicester Motion, a business park based at the town's former RAF base after the fire broke out on Thursday evening. On Saturday, firefighters from Oxfordshire Fire and Rescue Service (OFRS) were seen forming a guard of honour in memory of their two colleagues. Among the cards and messages among the flowers was a child's drawing covered in fire engine stickers with the words: \"Thank you hero fighters.\"  Jennie Logan, 30 and Martyn Sadler, 38, who died both worked for OFRS. David Chester, 57, who ran the business Chesters & Sons on the site for 12 years, also died. Two other firefighters suffered serious injuries and remain in hospital. Bicester Rugby Union Football Club (RUFC) paid tribute to Ms Logan and Mr Sadler who were both members. The club's chairman Chris Dabell told Sky News: \"There is immense loss and sadness in the club. We are just one family. We are all massively impacted by this.\" The club also posted a message on X, describing their \"profound sadness\". Residents have been leaving personal messages underneath the Bicester Motion sign at the entrance to the site. A golden plaque has been installed underneath with a tribute from the \"Bicester community\", which reads: \"Our thoughts and prayers go out to all of those affected by the sad loss of two firefighters and the member of the public.\" Another message read: \"Sending all our love to those who don't think twice making that sacrifice to help others.\" Angela Roseline, who brought flowers to the scene, said: \"It's affected me so badly that I had to come down just to show my respects.\" A navy blue T-shirt was left at the scene by firefighters from the London Fire Brigade, which Mr Sadler also worked for. A fundraising page has been set up \"to support the families in this sad and undoubtedly stressful time\". On Saturday, police remained outside the entrance to Bicester Motion, which hosts classic car and aviation firms.

However there were \"small pockets of smoke and heat so our fire crews remain on site dampening down\", it added. The cause of the fire is under investigation. Thames Valley Police has asked for people to avoid laying flowers at fire stations or at Bicester Motion to prevent obstructing roads and instead place them in Garth Park, Bicester. A book of condolence has also been opened at Garth House."

The protest, organised by the Palestine Solidarity Campaign, saw demonstrators walk from Embankment to Downing Street as they called on the UK government to \"take action to end the ongoing ethnic cleansing of Palestinians from their land\". Israel has vehemently denied committing genocide against Palestinians. The march on Saturday saw smaller counter-protests organised by Stop the Hate. Israeli flags were flown and \"Happy Birthday\" was played. The protest came as Israeli forces have ramped up a bombing campaign in Gaza and mobilised for a massive new ground assault. More than 150 people have been killed in Israeli strikes in the last 24 hours, according to the Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza.

Israel's defence minister Israel Katz said Hamas had \"refused to discuss negotiations without a cessation of the war\", but after the airstrikes and the mobilisation of forces the militant group's representatives \"have agreed to sit in a room and seriously discuss the deal\". \"Israel emphasises that if the talks do not progress, the [military] operation will continue,\" he added."

The US president made the announcement on Truth Social - shortly after the Ukrainian president condemned Russia for the \"deliberate killing of civilians\" after a drone hit a bus in north-eastern Ukraine.

In an all-caps post, he said: \"HOPEFULLY IT WILL BE A PRODUCTIVE DAY, A CEASEFIRE WILL TAKE PLACE, AND THIS VERY VIOLENT WAR, A WAR THAT SHOULD HAVE NEVER HAPPENED, WILL END. GOD BLESS US ALL!!!\" The Ukrainian town of Bilopillia today declared a period of mourning lasting until Monday after nine people were killed in a Russian drone attack - which occurred just hours after Kyiv and Moscow held peace talks. Seven others were injured, Ukrainian authorities said. The bus was evacuating civilians from a frontline area when the drone hit, the country's national police said.  A \"father, mother and daughter\" were among the dead, Mr Zelenskyy said, writing on Telegram: \"All the deceased were civilians. And the Russians could not have failed to understand what kind of vehicle they were targeting.\" The attack has also been condemned by British Foreign Secretary David Lammy, who said he was \"appalled\". \"If Putin is serious about peace, Russia must agree to a full and immediate ceasefire, as Ukraine has done,\" he wrote on X. Representatives for Kyiv and Moscow met for direct peace talks in Istanbul, Turkey, just hours before the drone attack. While the discussions - which were not attended by the Mr Putin or Mr Zelenskyy - did not result in a truce, both countries agreed to exchange 1,000 prisoners in their biggest swap yet. Ukraine's intelligence chief, Kyrylo Budanov, said on national television the exchange could happen as early as next week.  Russia 'threatened eternal war' at peace talks After a Ukrainian official yesterday said Russia made \"unacceptable\" demands during the discussions, a source from the Kyiv delegation has now told Sky News that Moscow threatened \"eternal war\". Separately, a senior Kyiv official said Russia's proposed ceasefire terms included the full withdrawal of troops from four regions of Ukraine: Donetsk, Zaporizhzhia, Kherson and Luhansk. Moscow also called for international recognition that those regions and Crimea - annexed in 2014 - are Russian and for Ukraine to become a neutral state, with no allied troops stationed there, they said. The Kremlin declined to comment on the matter.

        "Content": "\n          International affairs editor\n              @DominicWaghorn\n Vladimir Putin made a mockery this week of Donald Trump's efforts to end the war in Ukraine. Far from punishing him for it, the US president went out of his way to dodge calls to get tough with the Russian leader. Follow latest updates on Ukraine war On Sunday, President Trump called on leaders of both Russia and Ukraine to meet. He posted: \"President Putin of Russia wants to meet on Thursday, in Turkey, to negotiate a possible end to the BLOODBATH. Ukraine should agree to this, IMMEDIATELY.\" That post let the Russian leader off the hook. Only the day before, Putin had been ordered by Ukraine's allies, including America, to agree to a 30-day unconditional ceasefire. The Russian president had swerved that demand, suggesting talks instead. \"If the ceasefire is not respected, the US and its partners will impose further sanctions,\" Trump posted before swivelling and backing Putin's proposals for talks instead. Undeterred, Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy accepted the call. Putin though refused to go, sending officials instead. And yet there was no reprimand from the US president. Instead, he chose to undermine the talks he had himself called for. \"Look, nothing is going to happen until Putin and I get together,\" he told reporters on Air Force One. So much for that then.  It is what happened in those talks though that should give the US president the greatest pause for thought about Putin's intentions - as it does in Kyiv. The message they brought was blunt and belligerent, threatening eternal war. \"We don't want war, but we're ready to fight for a year, two, three - however long it takes,\" lead Russian negotiator Vladimir Medinsky is reported to have said. \"We fought Sweden for 21 years. How long are you ready to fight?\" Far from offering a compromise, they are reported to have demanded the withdrawal of Ukrainian troops from the four regions they have partially seized by force and the capitulation of another two, just for good measure. And there was a chilling moment when the Russians are reported to have threatened their interlocutors like gangsters. \"Maybe some of those sitting here at this table will lose more of their loved ones,\" Mednisky said. Russia is prepared to fight forever. For Sergiy Kyslytsya, Ukraine's deputy foreign minister, that was personal. Max, his 23-year-old nephew, lost his life fighting the Russians in 2022 not long after their illegal and unprovoked invasion began. Read more from Sky News:Nine killed in attack on Ukrainian busFirst direct Russia-Ukraine talks since 2022Analysis: Talks reveal a stark reality about war At the end of this week, Putin appears scornful of Western efforts to end this war through a ceasefire and negotiations and Trump seems happy to let him get away with it. Even Fox News, normally slavishly subservient to Trump, is wondering what gives. Its anchor Bret Baier is no Jeremy Paxman, but in an interview last night asked Donald Trump 10 times if he might finally now put pressure on Putin. The US president ducked and dived, talking about the money he had made in his Gulf tour, Zelenskyy's shortcomings, Biden, and Iran instead. But he did not give a straight answer to the question. With performances like that, Putin has nothing to worry about. Trump's position though seems increasingly untenable. Ukraine's European allies though should be alarmed. They threatened Russia with sanctions and retaliation last weekend if he rejected a ceasefire. He now has. With or without America, will they be good to their word?"

        "Content": " Israel and Hamas said ceasefire talks have resumed in Qatar - even as Israeli forces ramped up a bombing campaign and mobilised for a massive new ground assault. Earlier, the Israeli military said it had been \"conducting extensive strikes and mobilising troops\" as part of preparations to expand operations in Gaza. Israel's defence minister Israel Katz said Hamas had \"refused to discuss negotiations without a cessation of the war\", but after the airstrikes and the mobilisation of forces the militant group's representatives \"have agreed to sit in a room and seriously discuss the deal\". \"Israel emphasises that if the talks do not progress, the [military] operation will continue,\" he added. A Hamas source told Sky News that ceasefire talks began in Doha on Saturday morning. Hamas 'keen to exert all the effort needed' Hamas official Taher al Nono told Reuters news agency that the two sides were involved in discussions without \"pre-conditions\". He added Hamas was \"keen to exert all the effort needed\" to help mediators make the negotiations a success. More than 150 people have been killed in Israeli strikes in the last 24 hours, according to the Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza. This week has been one of the deadliest phases of bombardment since a truce collapsed in March and marked a significant escalation in Israel's offensive. The Israeli military's preparations to expand operations in Gaza have included the build-up of tanks and troops along the border. It is part of \"Operation Gideon Chariot\", which Israel says is aimed at defeating Hamas and getting its hostages back. Trump speaks with freed hostage An Israeli defence official said earlier this month that the operation would not be launched before Donald Trump concluded his visit to the Middle East. The US president ended his trip on Friday, with no apparent progress towards a new peace deal. Ahead of his visit, Hamas released American-Israeli hostage Edan Alexander as part of ongoing efforts to achieve a permanent ceasefire. On Saturday evening, the White House released a video of the US president speaking with the 21-year-old, who was believed to be the last living American hostage in Gaza. Mr Alexander is heard telling Mr Trump that \"you're the only reason I'm here\" in the clip, and said: \"You saved my life.\" The US president then tells him: \"For a while, we thought we lost you, actually. A lot of people thought you were not around anymore... \"Just really honoured, and you're an American, and we love you, and we're going to take good care of you.\"  Meanwhile on Saturday, leaders at the annual summit of the Arab League in Baghdad said they were trying to reach a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas in Gaza. They also promised to contribute to the reconstruction of the territory once the war stops. The meeting comes two months after Israel ended a ceasefire reached with the Hamas militant group. Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on 5 May that Israel was planning an expanded, intensive offensive against Hamas as his security cabinet approved plans that could involve seizing Gaza and controlling aid. This week, Israel said it had bombed the European Hospital because it was home to an underground Hamas base, but Sky News analysis has cast doubt on its evidence. Israel's goal is the elimination of Hamas, which attacked southern Israel on 7 October 2023, killing around 1,200 people and seizing about 250 hostages. Its military response has killed more than 53,000 people, according to the Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza, which does not differentiate between civilians and combatants."

        "Content": "\n          Europe correspondent\n              @adamparsons\n  We are ushered down some stairs beside a Lebanese restaurant and along a path next to a small garden. We walk past some guards, into a private dining room and there is a man in a hoodie, offering a hand. This is George Simion, just 38 years old but now sitting on the threshold of remarkable power. He is the populist politician who has made it to the run-off to become Romania's president. The disruptor up against the mayor of Bucharest, Nicusor Dan. The radical against the centrist. Simion apologises for dressing down and tells me, with a laugh, that he will be wearing a suit \"when I meet President Zelenskyy and President Trump\". The name Trump will crop up a few times in our conversation. On the table next to him is a red Make America Great Again baseball hat. Simion makes no secret of his admiration for Donald Trump. So what, I ask, does he take from the leadership style of the American president? \"His way of speaking the truth,\" he replies. \"His way of defending one's country and one's interests. \"We are all, in Europe and America, fed up with politically correct people who undermine our freedom and opinions. \"We are fighting for freedom of speech and free election. We are fighting for God against evil.\" The remarkable thing about this election is that, really, it shouldn't be happening. It is six months since the initial presidential election was annulled, after the country's highest court decided that the leading candidate, the nationalist Calin Georgescu, should be disqualified due to allegations of electoral interference by Russia. Simion could be the one to prosper from that. But - and here's the twist - he's also been one of the loudest critics of the decision to cancel the election. He blames \"the deep state\" for trying to subvert democracy, and insists the move has failed. \"They managed to build a big statue for Mr Georgescu to make him a big victim,\" says Simion. \"Clearly the majority of the Romanian people now hate their guts for how they manage to govern the country. \"We are getting poorer and poorer and that's why we have so many Romanians in Great Britain.\" And in the biggest twist of all, he now talks of bringing Georgescu into government, should he win the presidency. So, I ask, would he really offer the job of prime minister to Georgescu - a man who once told me that COVID wasn't real and that he was being undermined by a global conspiracy led by George Soros? \"If we have a landslide victory tomorrow - and if Calin Georgescu wants it - then yes, of course. \"They tried to ban me, kick me out, bribe me - with lots and lots of cash. I'm not for sale. I'm doing this for my country and for honour.\"  He said he would follow Trump's lead on Ukraine, which neighbours Romania, and played down any suggestion that he would extend a hand of friendship to Moscow. \"Russia left really bad memories here, and many scars, and we don't believe that in the foreseeable future we would have good relations,\" he told me. He did support peace negotiations between Russia and the United States, insisting they would need to include security guarantees, particularly to protect countries such as Romania and the Baltic states. Read more:The chilling moment in Russia-Ukraine peace talksIt's the Trump era and Putin knows how to exploit it 'We want you Brits back' And there was a word, too, for Britain. Simion told me he regretted Britain's decision to leave the European Union, but said he could understand \"why you want to get away from Ursula von der Leyden and Emmanuel Macron\". Romania, he emphasised, had worked hard to get a place within the EU and NATO \"so we are here to stay and won't be going anywhere\". But he said the EU should focus on being an economic project - the idea of a more federal Europe seems to horrify him. \"We would like more and more cooperation with you British,\" he said. \"We feel bad that we are not in the same single market and we share lots of history together and we want you Brits back. \"I learned much more about British culture and civilisation during the English lessons in my school than many of your high school kids do. So we hope to have the same future as part of the free world.\" 'It will be a landslide' Our time is up, but before I leave he shows me a chart on the wall, marked with predictions from his team. The most optimistic has him winning with 57% of the vote, but he disagrees. \"It will be a landslide,\" he tells me. \"At least 60%.\" He may not have decades of experience, but he does not lack for confidence."

        "Content": "\n          Arts and entertainment reporter\n              @BethanyMinelle\n Austria has won Eurovision 2025, with Austrian-Filipino singer-songwriter JJ taking the glass microphone. The 24-year-old singer - whose real name is Johannes Pietsch - originally trained as a countertenor, and represented his country with the operatic ballad Wasted Love, dramatically staged on a storm-tossed ship. The song, which was not dissimilar to that of last year's winner Nemo, told the story of unrequited love, with a techno breakdown near the end. Austria has won Eurovision twice before, the last time in 2014 with Conchita Wurst's pop hit Rise Like A Phoenix. Israel's Yuval Raphael, who survived the 7 October 2023 attacks which were the catalyst for Israel's ongoing offensive in Gaza, was the runner-up with piano ballad New Day Will Rise, performed in Hebrew, French and English. The singer was left \"shaken and upset\", after two pro-Palestinian protesters rushed towards her during her grand final performance in the St Jakobshalle arena in Basel, Switzerland. Organisers confirmed a backstage crew member was hit with paint but was not hurt. A spokesman for the Swiss Broadcasting Corporation SRG SSR said: \"At the end of the Israeli performance, a man and a woman tried to get over a barrier onto the stage. \n                  Eurovision Song Contest 2025 in pictures\n                 \n                  Eurovision 2025: Sex, survival and saunas - all the songs to look out for\n                 \n                  Clodagh Rodgers: Eurovision star and face of Bisto gravy dies\n                 \"They were stopped. One of the two agitators threw paint and a crew member was hit. The crew member is fine and nobody was injured. The man and the woman were taken out of the venue and handed over to the police.\" A Basel police spokesman later said: \"The organiser handed the two people over to the police. The police checked the two people and then released them. It is now up to the organiser to decide whether to press charges.\" Israel has won Eurovision four times. Just as the grand final began broadcasting, Spanish broadcaster shared a message of Palestinian support which read: \"When human rights are at stake, silence is not an option. Peace and justice for Palestine.\" The broadcaster had already received a warning from the European Broadcasting Union (EBU) over political statements reported by Israeli broadcaster Kan. The EBU said in response to the latter incident: \"We can confirm that we have spoken to RTVE regarding this matter and made it clear that commentators are expected to maintain neutrality within the broadcasts of the Eurovision Song Contest.\" During the evening, there were also pro-Palestinian protests near the centre of Basel, as well as a small group nearby protesting with Israeli flags. Israeli National Security Council had issued a warning to Israeli civilians in the city to keep a low profile during the competition. In a change from last year's contest in Malmo, Sweden, the ban on certain flags being waved by the audience was relaxed which meant Palestinian symbols could be seen in the arena.

However, for the second year running, the UK received no points in the public score. The UK has had five wins at Eurovision, but in recent years has struggled to rank, with the exception being Sam Ryder with Space Man in 2022, who came second. Last year, Olly Alexander was placed 18th at Malmo, and Mae Muller was second to last the previous year in Liverpool. The Eurovision grand final took place on Friday evening, with the winner from among the 26 performing nations decided by a mix of public voting and points from national juries. The four-hour-long show was presented by an all-female team - stand-up comedian Hazel Brugger, TV presenter Michelle Hunziker and Eurovision veteran Sandra Studer. There were performances by previous Eurovision runners-up Croatia's Baby Lasagna and Finland's Kaarija, as well as last year's winner Nemo during the night. Estonia's Tommy Cash came third in the contest - just one point behind Israel - with his controversial dance-popsong Espresso Macchiato, which has irritated many Italians by stereotyping the entire nation. Sweden had been widely tipped to win with their sauna-themed entry Bara Bada Bastu (Just Sauna), but ended up coming fourth. Ukraine, who have made a strong showing each since they first entered the competition in 2003, and who won in 2023, came ninth. Last year, protests and politics overshadowed the singing event amid the outbreak of war in Gaza, with some calling for Israel to be kicked out of the contest.

        "Content": "A chess grandmaster who is playing a single game against 140,000 people thinks the match is heading for a draw. The mega-match features undisputed world number one Norwegian Magnus Carlsen playing freestyle chess online against \"the world\". The game, which began on 4 April, allows Team World to vote on each move, and each side has 24 hours to make their play. In freestyle chess, the bishops, knights, rooks, queen and king are randomly shuffled around the board while the pawns remain in their usual spots. The format is popular because it allows players to be more creative and avoid memorisation. Described as \"Magnus Carlsen versus The World\", it had been predicted Carlsen would win by a wide margin but his Team World opposition could force a draw if it checks Carlsen's king three times. \"Right now we're heading towards a draw by perpetual check,\" Carlsen said in a statement. \"I felt that I was a little bit better, early in the opening, then maybe I didn't play that precisely. Honestly, since then, they haven't given me a single chance. So now, I think, it's just heading towards the draw.\" Grandmaster is a chess celebrity Carlsen became a grandmaster at 13 and enjoys celebrity status that few other players have. The 34-year-old became the world's top-ranked player in 2011 and has won five world championships. He achieved the highest-ever chess rating of 2882 in 2014 and has remained the undisputed world number one for more than a decade Last year, he quit a tournament in New York after refusing to change out of the jeans he was wearing. He later accepted a fine, and officials agreed to relax the dress code.

        "Content": "One person has died in a bomb explosion near a reproductive health clinic in California which the FBI said was an \"intentional act of terrorism\". The incident took place in Palm Springs, a city two hours east of Los Angeles, and is being investigated as a possible car explosion. The city's mayor Ron DeHarte said one person died in the blast, adding that the bomb was \"either in or near\" a vehicle. The deceased's identity is not known, Palm Springs police said. Dr Maher Abdallah, who runs the American Reproductive Centers clinic, told the Associated Press his facility was damaged but all staff were safe and accounted for. The explosion damaged the office space where the practice conducts patient consultations, but the IVF lab and stored embryos were unharmed, he added. \"I really have no clue what happened,\" he said. \"Thank God today happened to be a day that we have no patients.\" In a statement posted on Facebook, the clinic said it was \"heartbroken\" to learn someone died in the explosion and added: \"Our deepest condolences go out to the individuals and families affected.\" It continued: \"Our mission has always been to help build families, and in times like these, we are reminded of just how fragile and precious life is. \"In the face of this tragedy, we remain committed to creating hope - because we believe that healing begins with community, compassion, and care.\" The clinic will be fully operational on Monday, it added. \"This moment has shaken us - but it has not stopped us. We will continue to serve with strength, love, and the hope that brings new life into the world,\" the statement concluded. The Palm Springs city government said in a post on Facebook that the explosion happened on North Indian Canyon Drive, near East Tachevah Drive, before 11am local time (6pm GMT). A burned-out car can be seen in a parking lot behind the building in aerial footage. The blast caved in the clinic's roof and blew debris across four lanes of the road. Another person said he was inside a cannabis dispensary nearby when he felt a massive explosion. Nima Tabrizi said: \"The building just shook, and we go outside and there's massive cloud smoke.\" Investigators from the FBI and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives are travelling to the scene to help assess what happened. On Saturday evening, Akil Davies, head of the FBI's Los Angeles branch, said the explosion was an \"intentional act of terrorism\". He added that authorities were still working to confirm the identity of the person who died at the scene. While he did not directly say whether that person was the suspect, he said authorities were not searching for a suspect. A White House official also told Sky's US partner network NBC News that US President Donald Trump was monitoring the situation. California governor Gavin Newsom has been briefed on the explosion, his press office said."

In the Missouri city of St Louis, five people were confirmed dead and more than 5,000 homes were damaged, mayor Cara Spencer said on Saturday. The storm system originally hit Scott County, 130 miles south of St Louis, on Friday, killing two people, Sheriff Derick Wheetley said. The devastation that ensued saw roofs torn off buildings, blown-out windows, toppled trees, and power lines. St Louis mayor Cara Spencer said: \"Our city is grieving tonight. The loss of life and the destruction is truly, truly horrendous.\" Dozens of people are believed to have been injured and in hospital, but the exact numbers in Missouri have not been confirmed. Kentucky officials described the situation there as a \"mass casualty event\" after the weather system tore across Laurel County late on Friday. At least 17 people were killed in Laurel County when a twister touched down around midnight, governor Mr Beshear said on Saturday afternoon on social media. Among the dead was a firefighter with the Laurel County Fire Department who was fatally injured while responding to the havoc caused by the weather.

He said the show, if accepted by a network, would \"get to know\" contestants and \"their stories and their journeys\", while \"celebrating them as humans\".

Currently, the federal Enforcement and Removals Operations agency only has around 7,700 staff - but the boost would help fulfil Mr Trump's inauguration promises. The Trump administration has already recruited 10,000 troops under state and federal orders to bolster the US-Mexico border. Some have now been given the power to detain migrants within a newly militarised strip of land just adjacent to it."

        "Content": " Seven prisoners could be \"frankly anywhere\" in the US after breaking out of a New Orleans jail. Authorities have been left wondering - how did they do it? The audacious escape saw 10 men flee the jail on Friday through a hole behind a toilet and scale a wall, in scenes reminiscent of The Shawshank Redemption movie. The men are believed to have made their jailbreak while the lone guard assigned to their cell pod was away getting food. While three have been recaptured, seven of the men - among them accused murderers - remain at large. Prison officials believe they may have had inside help. Surveillance footage showed the escapees sprinting out of the Orleans Justice Centre, using blankets to scale a barbed wire fence and then sprinting across a nearby highway. The absence of the men went unnoticed for more than seven hours - officers only learned of their escape the next morning during a routine headcount. A photograph showing the hole the prisoners escaped through also revealed scrawled messages - including one saying \"To Easy LoL\" with an arrow pointing at the gap. \n                  New Orleans pays tribute to New Year's attack victims with 'outpouring of love' at vigil\n                 \n                  Death of New Orleans attack victim has impacted Royal Family in a devastatingly personal way\n                 \n                  William and Kate release statement after death of his ex-nanny's stepson in New Orleans attack\n                 They ditched their jail uniforms after leaving the facility - and it is still unclear how some of them obtained regular clothes so quickly, officials said. Orleans Parish Sheriff Susan Hutson said the men were able to get out because of \"defective locks\". Sheriff Hutson said there are indications that people inside her department helped the fugitives escape. \"It's almost impossible, not completely, but almost impossible for anybody to get out of this facility without help.\" Read more from Sky News:R&B singer Chris Brown denied bailNine revelations from Cassie's testimony at Diddy trial Who are the escaped men?

Another escapee, Corey Boyd, had pleaded not guilty to a murder charge.

Louisiana Attorney General Liz Murrill called the escape \"beyond unacceptable\" and said local authorities waited too long to inform the public.

        "Content": "\n          City editor\n              @MarkKleinmanSky\n Quintessentially, the luxury concierge service founded by the Queen's nephew, is in talks to find a buyer months after it warned of \"material uncertainty\" over its future. Sky News has learned that the company, which was set up by Sir Ben Elliot and his business partners in 1999, is working with advisers on a process aimed at finding a new owner or investors. City sources said this weekend that Quintessentially was already in discussions with prospective buyers and was anticipating receipt of a number of firm offers. Sir Ben, the former Conservative Party co-chairman under Boris Johnson, owns a significant minority stake in the company. The Quintessentially group operates a number of businesses, although its core activity remains the provision of lifestyle support to high net worth individuals including celebrities, royalty, and leading businesspeople. It also counts major companies among its clients and offers services such as organising private jet flights and performances by top musicians. The sale process is being overseen by a firm called Beyond, although further details, including the price that the business might fetch, were unclear on Saturday. \n                  Money blog: Why gold spike means you need to update your home insurance\n                 \n                  Superstar Adele joins backers of music royalties platform Audoo\n                 \n                  The Sunday Times Rich List: Billionaires fall as King rises to match Rishi Sunak\n                 One insider said parties who had been contacted by Beyond were being offered the option to buy a controlling interest in Quintessentially. This could be implemented through a combination of the repayment of outstanding loans, an injection of new funding into the business, and the purchase of existing shareholders' interests, they added. Quintessentially's founders, including Sir Ben, are thought to be keen to retain an equity interest in the company after any deal. In January 2022, newspaper reports suggested that Quintessentially had been put up for sale with a valuation of £140m. Deloitte, the accountancy firm, was charged with finding a buyer at the time but a transaction failed to materialise. Sir Ben, who was knighted in Mr Johnson's resignation honours list, turned to one of Quintessentially's shareholders for financial support during the pandemic. World Fuel Services, an energy and aviation services company, is owed £15.5m as well as £3.5m in accrued interest, according to one person close to the process. The loan is said to include a warrant to convert it into equity upon repayment. Read more from Sky News:This year's Sunday Times Rich List revealedGold spike means you should update your insuranceCheapest pint in the UK revealed Quintessentially does not disclose the number or identities of many of its clients, although it said in annual accounts filed at Companies House in January that it had increased turnover to £29.6m in the year to 30 April 2024. The accounts suggested the company was seeing growth in demand from clients internationally. \"During the last year, we have not only renewed important corporate contracts like Mastercard, but have also expanded by adding new corporate clients like Swiss4 in the UK, R360 in India, and Visa in the Middle East and South America,\" they said. In its experiences and events division, it won a contract to work with the Red Sea Film Festival and to provide corporate concierge services to the Saudi Premier League. It added that Allianz, the German insurer, BMW, and South African lender Standard Bank were among other clients with which it had signed contracts. The accounts included the warning of a \"risk that the pace and level at which business returns could be materially less than forecast, requiring the group and company to obtain external funding which may not be forthcoming and therefore this creates material uncertainty that may cast ultimately cast doubt about the … ability to continue as a going concern\". This weekend, a Quintessentially spokesman declined to comment on the sale process."

        "Content": " Former Scottish first minister Humza Yousaf has attacked Sir Keir Starmer for his \"dog whistle\" stance on immigration after the prime minister said the UK risked becoming an \"island of strangers\". In a piece penned by Mr Yousaf for LBC, the former leader of the Scottish National Party (SNP) repeated claims the prime minister's recent remarks on immigration were a \"modern echo\" of Enoch Powell's infamous 1968 Rivers Of Blood speech. The prime minister stirred controversy earlier this week when he argued Britain \"risked becoming an island of strangers\" if immigration levels were not cut. After many MPs criticised his language, Sir Keir rejected the comparison to Powell, with his official spokesperson saying migrants have made a \"massive contribution\" to society but his point was that the Tories \"lost control of the system\". In the LBC piece published on Saturday, Mr Yousaf said: \"Powell's 1968 speech warned of immigration as an existential threat to 'our blood and our culture', stoking racial panic that led directly to decades of hostile migration policies. \"Starmer's invocation of 'strangers' is a modern echo - a dog-whistle to voters who blame migrants for every social ill, from stretched public services to the cost-of-living crisis. \"It betrays a failure to understand, or deliberately mask the fact that Britain's prosperity depends on migration, on openness not building walls.\"  Read more:Labour's immigration approach builds on Tory rollbacksFarage on how Reform UK would deal with migration Sir Keir made the comments at a news conference in which measures were announced to curb net migration, including banning care homes from recruiting overseas, new English language requirements for visa holders and stricter rules on gaining British citizenship. The package is aimed at reducing the number of people coming to the UK by up to 100,000 per year, though the government has not officially set a target. The government is under pressure to tackle legal migration, as well as illegal immigration, amid Reform UK's surge in the polls. Mr Yousaf concluded his article saying the UK was \"on the brink of possibly handing the keys of No 10 to Nigel Farage\"."

        "Headline": "The world's biggest music competition - the Eurovision Song Contest - watched by hundreds of millions, has crowned its winner in Basel, Switzerland.",
        "Content": "\n          Arts and entertainment reporter\n              @BethanyMinelle\n Austria has won Eurovision 2025, with Austrian-Filipino singer-songwriter JJ taking the glass microphone. The 24-year-old singer - whose real name is Johannes Pietsch - originally trained as a countertenor, and represented his country with the operatic ballad Wasted Love, dramatically staged on a storm-tossed ship. The song, which was not dissimilar to that of last year's winner Nemo, told the story of unrequited love, with a techno breakdown near the end. Austria has won Eurovision twice before, the last time in 2014 with Conchita Wurst's pop hit Rise Like A Phoenix. Israel's Yuval Raphael, who survived the 7 October 2023 attacks which were the catalyst for Israel's ongoing offensive in Gaza, was the runner-up with piano ballad New Day Will Rise, performed in Hebrew, French and English. The singer was left \"shaken and upset\", after two pro-Palestinian protesters rushed towards her during her grand final performance in the St Jakobshalle arena in Basel, Switzerland. Organisers confirmed a backstage crew member was hit with paint but was not hurt. A spokesman for the Swiss Broadcasting Corporation SRG SSR said: \"At the end of the Israeli performance, a man and a woman tried to get over a barrier onto the stage. \n                  Eurovision Song Contest 2025 in pictures\n                 \n                  Eurovision 2025: Sex, survival and saunas - all the songs to look out for\n                 \n                  Clodagh Rodgers: Eurovision star and face of Bisto gravy dies\n                 \"They were stopped. One of the two agitators threw paint and a crew member was hit. The crew member is fine and nobody was injured. The man and the woman were taken out of the venue and handed over to the police.\" A Basel police spokesman later said: \"The organiser handed the two people over to the police. The police checked the two people and then released them. It is now up to the organiser to decide whether to press charges.\" Israel has won Eurovision four times. Just as the grand final began broadcasting, Spanish broadcaster shared a message of Palestinian support which read: \"When human rights are at stake, silence is not an option. Peace and justice for Palestine.\" The broadcaster had already received a warning from the European Broadcasting Union (EBU) over political statements reported by Israeli broadcaster Kan. The EBU said in response to the latter incident: \"We can confirm that we have spoken to RTVE regarding this matter and made it clear that commentators are expected to maintain neutrality within the broadcasts of the Eurovision Song Contest.\" During the evening, there were also pro-Palestinian protests near the centre of Basel, as well as a small group nearby protesting with Israeli flags. Israeli National Security Council had issued a warning to Israeli civilians in the city to keep a low profile during the competition. In a change from last year's contest in Malmo, Sweden, the ban on certain flags being waved by the audience was relaxed which meant Palestinian symbols could be seen in the arena.

However, for the second year running, the UK received no points in the public score. The UK has had five wins at Eurovision, but in recent years has struggled to rank, with the exception being Sam Ryder with Space Man in 2022, who came second. Last year, Olly Alexander was placed 18th at Malmo, and Mae Muller was second to last the previous year in Liverpool. The Eurovision grand final took place on Friday evening, with the winner from among the 26 performing nations decided by a mix of public voting and points from national juries. The four-hour-long show was presented by an all-female team - stand-up comedian Hazel Brugger, TV presenter Michelle Hunziker and Eurovision veteran Sandra Studer. There were performances by previous Eurovision runners-up Croatia's Baby Lasagna and Finland's Kaarija, as well as last year's winner Nemo during the night. Estonia's Tommy Cash came third in the contest - just one point behind Israel - with his controversial dance-popsong Espresso Macchiato, which has irritated many Italians by stereotyping the entire nation. Sweden had been widely tipped to win with their sauna-themed entry Bara Bada Bastu (Just Sauna), but ended up coming fourth. Ukraine, who have made a strong showing each since they first entered the competition in 2003, and who won in 2023, came ninth. Last year, protests and politics overshadowed the singing event amid the outbreak of war in Gaza, with some calling for Israel to be kicked out of the contest. Eden Golan's Hurricane ended up finishing in fifth place. Last year also saw The Netherlands' act Joost Klein kicked out of the competition by the EBU over alleged verbal threats to a female production worker, which he denied. This year, Dutch singer Claude, finished in 12th place with his song C'est La Vie. Next year's competition, Eurovision's 70th, will be held in Austria."

        "Content": "A chess grandmaster who is playing a single game against 140,000 people thinks the match is heading for a draw. The mega-match features undisputed world number one Norwegian Magnus Carlsen playing freestyle chess online against \"the world\". The game, which began on 4 April, allows Team World to vote on each move, and each side has 24 hours to make their play. In freestyle chess, the bishops, knights, rooks, queen and king are randomly shuffled around the board while the pawns remain in their usual spots. The format is popular because it allows players to be more creative and avoid memorisation. Described as \"Magnus Carlsen versus The World\", it had been predicted Carlsen would win by a wide margin but his Team World opposition could force a draw if it checks Carlsen's king three times. \"Right now we're heading towards a draw by perpetual check,\" Carlsen said in a statement. \"I felt that I was a little bit better, early in the opening, then maybe I didn't play that precisely. Honestly, since then, they haven't given me a single chance. So now, I think, it's just heading towards the draw.\" Grandmaster is a chess celebrity Carlsen became a grandmaster at 13 and enjoys celebrity status that few other players have. The 34-year-old became the world's top-ranked player in 2011 and has won five world championships. He achieved the highest-ever chess rating of 2882 in 2014 and has remained the undisputed world number one for more than a decade Last year, he quit a tournament in New York after refusing to change out of the jeans he was wearing. He later accepted a fine, and officials agreed to relax the dress code.

In 1999, Russian grandmaster Garry Kasparov played against more than 50,000 people on the Microsoft Network, which Kasparov won after four months. Indian grandmaster Viswanathan Anand won his match last year against nearly 70,000 players on Chess.com, which is also hosting Carlsen's match."
