        "Content": "\n          North of England correspondent\n              @ShingiMararike\n  The mother of murdered teenager Brianna Ghey is calling on the government to introduce a ban on mobile phones in schools - a move she says will not only safeguard children, but also improve their behaviour and engagement in class. In February 2023, Brianna, 16, was stabbed to death by two 15-year-olds after being lured to a park in Warrington. In the lead-up to the attack, her killers had spent time on the dark web. At the same time, Brianna was also trapped online, struggling with a phone addiction. Her mother Esther Ghey's Phone Free Education campaign is driven by her personal experiences as a parent and the impact Brianna's phone use had on her education. \"All the arguments that me and Brianna had were down to her phone use,\" Esther said. \"But even in school, she had issues and I used to have phone calls from the school saying that Brianna wouldn't put her phone away.\" Brianna, who was transgender, struggled with an eating disorder and also self-harmed. Her mother says the constant time she spent online exacerbated those issues, while impacting her behaviour at school, where she had 120 safeguarding logs and 116 behaviour incidents recorded by her teachers. \"It was so difficult as a parent, because I felt in one way that I was failing and then in another way, and this is really difficult for me to speak about, I was so annoyed with Brianna,\" she recalled. \"I thought, why can't you just go to school, get your head down and just focus on your education, because this is important. \"Only now, after two years of being immersed in this world, do I realise that actually, it's so much harder than that.\" Research by the Children's Commission has shown that 79% of secondary schools are still allowing pupils to bring their mobile phones into school, and even into classrooms. How phone ban is working at Brianna's old school Esther is campaigning for government guidance on phones to become statutory, with funding also set aside for the equipment to help schools implement the ban, arguing the lack of legislation is \"setting children up to fail\". At Birchwood Community High School in Warrington, where Brianna was a pupil, they introduced a ban on phones last September. At the beginning of the day, pupils turn off their phones and place them in pouches, which are locked. At the end of the school day, the pouches are then unlocked. The headteacher, Emma Mills, said introducing these measures has come with several benefits. \"It's had an impact in all areas of school, and it's actually had a really positive impact in ways that I didn't foresee,\" said Ms Mills. \"Attendance has improved this year. In terms of behaviour, behaviour has improved. We've had no permanent exclusions this year in school, which is actually the first time since I've been headteacher in six years, there's been no permanent exclusion.\" This summer, the school also saw its best-ever GCSE results in the core subjects of science, maths, and English. 'They can live without their phones' For Ms Mills, another significant change has been the atmosphere in the school. \"They're not as worried, they're not as distracted,\" Ms Mills said. \"They've realised that they can live without their phones. Something else we've really noticed is that it's a bit louder in school at breaks and lunch times. It's because they're talking more, they're interacting more, and they're communicating more.\" The positive impact of a ban at Brianna's old school has served as encouragement to Esther, who has written an open letter addressed to Sir Keir Starmer and Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson, asking for government support. Read more:Screen time limit for children being considered'Whole society' approach needed to stop doomscrolling High-profile signatories include the actress Kate Winslet, as well as actor and film producer Stephen Graham. For Esther, who will deliver the letter to 10 Downing Street next month, the campaign is not just Brianna's legacy, but also creating societal change. \"I think it's important that we teach young people to live in the real world,\" she said. \"It's going to impact society at one point and I think this small amount of investment in students now will have a massive impact in the future.\""

        "Content": "The total cost of relocating Afghan nationals to the UK is estimated to be more than £2bn, according to a report by the National Audit Office (NAO). This includes 7,355 people eligible for resettlement in the UK under the Afghanistan Response Route (ARR) scheme, which was launched for those whose personal information was leaked in a February 2022 data breach. The Ministry of Defence (MoD) estimates the cost of resettling people in the UK through the ARR scheme to be around £850m, not including legal costs or compensation claims. But the ministry does not know the exact cost resulting from the data breach resettlement scheme because it did not separately identify the costs in its accounting system, the NAO said. It added that the MoD had not provided enough evidence to give the NAO \"confidence in its estimate of £850m in relation to past and future costs\". The total cost of all Afghan resettlement activity between 2021 and 2029 - including the ARR - is expected to exceed £2bn. About £563m of this has already been spent on Afghan resettlement schemes between 2021-22, for those who helped the British military during the war, and 2024-25, for those put at risk because of the data breach. The MoD expects to spend a further £1.5bn by March 2029. Data breach undiscovered for 18 months The cost skyrocketed due to the creation of the ARR scheme and those eligible under it, which came after an unnamed British official accidentally emailed details of 18,714 Afghan nationals who applied to be relocated to the UK under the previous scheme outside a secure government system. He sent the email in February 2022 in an attempt to verify information, believing the dataset to only contain around 150 rows of information, but it actually contained around 33,000. The MoD discovered the leak in August 2023 after seeing details of the emails had been posted by a Facebook user.  UK officials sent around 1,800 ARAP applicants in Pakistan a warning via WhatsApp to say their data may have been breached. Shortly after, two journalists inquired about the breach, causing then-defence secretary Ben Wallace to seek a court order, with the High Court granting a super-injunction. The super-injunction was only lifted in July 2025. Read more:Afghan man in data breach says he feels betrayedVictims of Afghan data leak receive scam emails In April 2024, the government secretly launched the ARR scheme specifically for those whose personal information was leaked in the data breach, who were ineligible for other resettlement schemes and who were at significant risk of reprisal by the ruling Taliban regime in Afghanistan. The MoD did not record separately who was resettled via the ARR scheme, arguing this was to maintain the secrecy of the ARR scheme while the super-injunction was in place, preventing disclosure of both the data breach and the existence of the injunction itself. £400m spent on resettling Afghans affected by breach The ministry estimates that £400m of the £850m estimated total cost of resettling Afghan nationals via the ARR scheme had been spent by July 2025, but the NAO said it had not been provided with sufficient evidence to support either estimate. In early July 2025, the government closed the ARR scheme to new applicants. The NAO report was welcomed by Sir Geoffrey Clifton-Brown, chair of the Public Accounts Committee, who said: \"After the High Court super-injunction was lifted earlier this year, confusion still remains over the reported £850m historic and future costs relating to the breach, with the MoD unable to provide sufficient assurance over their numbers. \"This figure does not include all legal costs or compensation claims, which currently remain unknown.\" He added that the Public Affairs Committee would be examining this issue in its inquiry next week."

Speaking at a news conference at the White House, the US president told reporters: \"We just, over the last few minutes, literally shot out a boat, a drug-carrying boat, a lot of drugs in that boat. \"And there's more where that came from. We have a lot of drugs pouring into our country, coming in for a long time.\" Secretary of State Marco Rubio then added: \"These particular drugs were probably headed to Trinidad or some other country in the Caribbean. \"Suffice to say the president is going to be on offence against drug cartels and drug trafficking in the United States.\" Mr Trump later posted a video on Truth Social of a vessel exploding, in what appeared to mark the first US military operation in the southern Caribbean to crack down on drug cartels. The president said on social media that the US military had identified the crew as members of Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua, which was designated a terrorist group in February. He then alleged that Tren de Aragua is being controlled by Venezuela's President Nicolas Maduro, which the country denies. Venezuelan officials have repeatedly said that Tren de Aragua is no longer active in their country after they dismantled it during a prison raid in 2023. The US last month doubled its reward for information leading to the arrest of Mr Maduro to $50m, accusing him of links to drug trafficking and criminal groups. The US has deployed warships in the southern Caribbean in recent weeks. Seven warships, along with one nuclear-powered fast-attack submarine, are either in the region or expected to arrive soon, carrying more than 4,500 sailors and Marines.

        "Content": "By Gemma Peplow, culture and entertainment reporter, and Katie Spencer, entertainment correspondent  Before he died alone in his jacuzzi, Matthew Perry had received three injections of ketamine in the space of just six hours. \"Shoot me up with a big one,\" he told his personal assistant, ahead of the final, fatal dose. According to court documents, in the period leading up to 28 October 2023, Kenneth Iwamasa was illegally administering Perry with between six and eight shots of the drug, an anaesthetic that can have hallucinogenic effects, each day. A live-in assistant, he admitted to finding the actor unconscious at his Pacific Palisades home on at least two occasions in the weeks prior. The hit that ultimately killed the Friends star was supplied by Jasveen Sangha, also known as the \"Ketamine Queen\" - a dealer who apparently only dealt \"with high-end and celebs\". She has agreed to plead guilty to five charges and will appear in court later today. Her charges, along with others filed against Iwamasa and others over the supply of ketamine to Perry, exposed part of Hollywood's underground drug network - and put the spotlight on the world of celebrity, money and power. 'Yes men' with terrible consequences Perry's death was met with both utter shock and a sad sense of the inevitable. The world knew him best as Chandler Bing, the comic heartbeat of Friends. But behind the jokes and the sarcasm, he was deeply troubled. \"It almost felt like we'd been mourning Matthew for a long time because his battle with that disease was a really hard one for him to fight,\" is how his former co-star Jennifer Aniston described his addiction in a recent interview. \"As hard as it was for all of us and for the fans, there's a part of me that thinks this is better... I'm glad he's out of that pain.\" The actor was an addict, and vulnerable - but also a huge star, worth millions. Iwamasa was administering the injections, ultimately playing God - but to him, the power most likely lay with his famous boss. His actions may seem inexcusable, but did he feel he had a choice? \"I think it was a situation that increasingly got more and more out of control,\" says Bonnie Low-Kramen, a former celebrity assistant turned trainer, and author of Be The Ultimate Assistant. Those who do the job, especially in Los Angeles, can be put under an enormous amount of pressure, she says, \"tasked with doing things many of us wouldn't imagine carrying out for our employers. It is a job which comes with an inherent power imbalance\". Which means it can be incredibly hard to say no. \"When people are rich and famous, they often have people around them who won't say no,\" she says. \"And assistants are in the yes business anyway. \"We're in the business of figuring out, 'well, let's solve the problem...'. When money is no object, there are new rules that apply in that situation and that can be really hard to handle.\" Iwamasa is not the first celebrity assistant asked to administer or pick up illegal drugs, she says, and Perry is not the first star to die after taking drugs. Ms Low-Kramen highlights the deaths of Janis Joplin, Prince and John Belushi as just a few other examples. \"Unfortunately, there are so many examples of this tragic end, where the abuse of drugs gets to a point where they've handled it for a really long time, and then the day comes when it can't be handled anymore.\" For those struggling with addiction, being surrounded by \"yes men\" can have terrible consequences, says Garrett Braukman, an addiction treatment executive in Hollywood. \"Treatment is difficult for people when they have yes men. They have a lot of people that are going to tell them you can get whatever you want, you can get drugs, you can get alcohol, you could do whatever, and no one is willing to really look at that from the perspective of how dangerous that is.\" Read more:Obituary: The one who made everyone laughMatthew Perry: A life in pictures Mr Braukman says addiction can go hand in hand with fame and that a \"high\" percentage of his patients work in the entertainment industry. \"I don't know how I would be able to stay clean and sober if I go to my grandma's house and there's 20 guys outside of my grandma's house taking pictures of me walking in. You become an animal to a degree that people are watching.\" Rise in use of ketamine The use of ketamine recreationally has been on the rise in recent years, in the UK as well as the US. In England, some 3,609 people started treatment for problems with the drug in the year 2023-2024 - more than eight times the number in 2014-2015, when 426 sought help, according to government statistics. In January, drag queen The Vivienne was found dead in the bath at their home in Cheshire, aged 32. The star's family later told how the performer had died \"from the effects of ketamine use causing a cardiac arrest\". Ketamine is usually taken recreationally as a crushed powder, but also sometimes injected or swallowed - making people feel detached and dreamlike. It can also cause severe bladder and kidney problems. Perry's struggles with alcohol and other drugs, before ketamine, were long running and well documented, starting with drinking as a teenager before moving on to painkilling prescription drugs Vicodin and OxyContin, and tranquilliser Xanax. \"I have spent upward of $7m (£5.8m) trying to get sober,\" he wrote in his memoir, released when he was clean, just a year before his death. While accepting the almost unsurpassable legacy of the hit show that made him a star, he said he hoped his support for fellow addicts would be the achievement he was best remembered for. \"When I die, I don't want Friends to be the first thing that's mentioned - I want helping others to be the first thing that's mentioned and I'm going to live the rest of my life proving that.\" He only lived for another year. Illegal use v therapy Before he died, Perry had been undergoing legal ketamine infusion therapy to treat depression and anxiety. The drug can be used as a treatment in clinical settings in the US, and some specialist and private centres in the UK - although there are concerns from some medics here about its use even in those settings. According to a postmortem report, the actor had reportedly been clean for 19 months before he started obtaining the drug illegally as well. It was not the supervised doses that killed him, but the idea of an addict taking the drug to help their problems might still sound shocking. In California, ketamine drips are legally used as pain relief, to treat mood disorders and to help with addiction. Other celebrities and notable figures - including Chrissy Teigen, Elon Musk and Sharon Osbourne - have all shared details of ketamine therapy and how it helped them. Dr Austin Harris, owner and medical director at NeuroRelief Ketamine Infusion Therapy, says historically the drug is \"extremely safe\" when used in the right conditions, and swears by its effectiveness. At the clinic in California, he explained to Sky News how it can help people with mood disorders and chronic pain, as well as those in recovery from drug or alcohol abuse. \"Which a lot of people who don't really understand this at a scientific level might think is an oxymoron,\" he says. \"But actually, it's profoundly beneficial - done properly - in resetting both neurologic and psychological patterns for substance abuse.\" Ketamine infusion \"restarts in our brain what should already be there\", he says, in terms of \"the neurologic road workers, to be able to then direct, to build new patterns and actual new nerve pathways\". One patient having therapy at the clinic also spoke to us, saying he had abused alcohol and marijuana, and occasionally opiate painkillers, for many years. \"I've had enough experience and decades of being addicted to drugs and alcohol and traumas and trying different things,\" he said. \"When I came out of that infusion I was like, wait a minute. I didn't have the shakes. I didn't have the cravings.\" Read more:Parties and busted doors: Living next to 'Ketamine Queen'The drug addiction leaving users in chronic pain Dr Harris emphasises the need for administration by a professional in a clinical setting. \"Matthew Perry was being illegally sold ketamine on the black market. The fact that a doctor happened to be one of several people that was illegally selling it to him should not be confused with the appropriate legal utilisation of ketamine.\" The actor was vulnerable, Dr Harris continues. \"It's absolutely abominable... You have someone with serious addiction problems, lifelong. And sadly, I think that he was really taken advantage of.\" The drugs stash  As well as Sangha and Iwamasa, the others charged over Perry's death are Erik Fleming, an associate of Perry's who was in contact with Sangha, Dr Mark Chavez, a physician, and Dr Salvador Plasencia, who also supplied ketamine illegally to Perry. \"I wonder how much this moron will pay,\" Dr Plasencia said in a text exchange between him and Chavez. After Perry died, Sangha desperately sought to cover her involvement. \"Delete all our messages,\" she instructed Fleming in a message on Signal. In March 2024, law enforcement searched Sangha's home and found 1.7kg of pressed pills containing methamphetamine, 79 vials of liquid ketamine, MDMA (ecstasy) tablets, counterfeit Xanax pills, baggies containing powdered ketamine and cocaine, and other drug-trafficking items such as a gold money counting machine, a scale, a wireless signal and hidden camera detector, drug packaging materials, and $5,723 in cash, according to her plea agreement. Sangha was happy to supply to Hollywood's rich and famous - and not an anomaly. Several books have been written by Tinseltown dealers, and only a few months ago, the Sean \"Diddy\" Combs trial heard from a former personal assistant to the hip-hop mogul who testified about meeting sellers for his boss. Now, as she becomes the last defendant to admit her role in Perry's death, the Ketamine Queen's guilty plea brings to a close the criminal investigation into the circumstances surrounding the tragedy. But in a world where money talks, where fame and addiction or mental health issues often go hand-in-hand, it is unlikely to be the last."

There were 3,081 protests this June, July, and August across England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland, figures from the National Police Chiefs' Council have revealed. Last summer, when riots were raging across the country following the Southport murders, police dealt with 2,942 protests. In 2023, it was 928. The summer months this year have been dominated by widespread demonstrations, some against the ban on Palestine Action and others against housing asylum seekers in hotels. 'Increasing tension' Gavin Stephens, chairman of the NPCC, said it was clear that there has been \"more community tension and more division\", adding that \"we all have a responsibility, policing included, to set the tone\". \"Anybody in a leadership position should think about how we can reduce and defuse tensions and not sow division,\" Mr Stephens said. The senior official said protests this year were a \"chronic pressure\" for police compared to last year's disorder, which was acute. \"This is not talking about the volume of protest, and this is not a commentary from policing on people's right to protest peacefully,\" he said. \"We absolutely support that in a democracy, but we do know that there is a climate of increasing tension and polarity in what we're seeing.\" He is convinced communities will be able to reunite and \"reset\", and said claims that the UK is on the verge of civil disobedience are \"exaggerated\".

She said she was four months into her pregnancy with the first of her three children with rapper Offset, and had not publicly shared news of her pregnancy After attending an appointment at the obstetrician's office - which had been closed to other patients on a Saturday for her privacy - she said Ms Ellis followed her to her fifth-floor appointment. Cardi then told the court she heard Ms Ellis say her name into a phone and appeared to be filming her, fearing Ms Ellis would out the fact that she was pregnant. \"I told her, 'Why are you recording?'\" she testified, \"and she said, 'Oh my bad.' She practically apologised.'\" As an argument broke out, Cardi said \"she's walking into me\" and testified that Ms Ellis was bigger than her, \"She is like, security-heavy,\" she added. \"She just looks a little, like she could protect the building.\" Read more from Sky News:Man who snatched cap from boy at US Open apologisesDead man found 'in a pool of blood' at Burning Man festival Ms Ellis testified earlier in the trial that the incident left her humiliated and traumatised, and the scar on her face required cosmetic surgery.

The pound dropped by more than a percent against the US dollar, while the yield on 30-year government debt (known as gilts) rose to the highest level since 1998. The real question now is: how much does she have to worry about it and, more to the point, what can she do about it? Let's start with the first question first. Bond yields are a measure of the interest rate paid on debt and, in the case of government debt, they are influenced by all sorts of things. This makes interpreting their movements quite tricky, at the best of times. For in one respect, they are a proxy for how creditworthy (or not) investors think a government is. If they think a country is about to default on its debt (Greek bonds and the euro crisis are perhaps the best example) then they might sell a country's bonds and, lo and behold, the interest rate on those bonds goes up.  But in another respect they also reflect what people think will happen to inflation and interest rates in the coming years (or, in the case of long-dated bonds like the 30-year gilt, the coming decades). So, if you think inflation is going to be higher for longer, then all else equal, you would expect gilt yields to be higher, since that implies the Bank of England will have to keep its interest rates higher. It all feeds into the government bond yield. \n                  Bank shares take fright as budget tax hike is floated\n                 \n                  Surprise good news as government borrowing less than forecast\n                 \n                  Something for everyone in UK's latest GDP data\n                 Nor is that the end of it, because these yields are also affected by all sorts of other things: how much demand is there from pension funds? What's the impact of the ageing population? How fast is the country going to grow? All of these things (and more) can have a bearing on the bond yield. Money latest: Hopes for interest rate cut suffer blow All of which is to say, there's rarely a single explanation for phenomena like the one we've got today. Consider the higher 30-year bond yields faced by the UK. On the one hand, there's a compelling explanation served up by the Whitehall and parliamentary drama of recent months. The government has failed to pass some key legislation cutting welfare spending. It has also had to do a U-turn on cutting winter fuel payments. Those two decisions mean it is left with a sizeable hole in the public finances in the coming years. That in turn makes it considerably more likely that it might have to borrow more, which in turn means investors might be getting more worried about Britain's indebtedness. That's totally consistent with higher gilt yields. And so perhaps it's no surprise that the UK's 30-year bond yield is considerably higher than other G7 nations.  But it's not quite that simple. For one thing, Britain is far from the only country in the G7 with a public finances problem. France and the US have deficit trajectories that look considerably less controlled than Britain's. Nor is it evident from other measures of fiscal concern - for instance, the credit default swaps insuring against a country going bust - that Britain is an outlier. Read more:Thames Water creditors offer £1bn 'sweetener'Empty flats that developers say sum up UK's housing crisis Now consider another datapoint: inflation. Britain has the highest inflation rate in the G7, by some margin. In other words, part of the explanation for the UK's high yields is that markets are fretting not just about fiscal policy (the stuff done in Whitehall) but monetary policy (the stuff done by the Bank of England in the city). Now, in practice these two worlds bleed into each other. Part (though certainly not all) of the reason inflation is high is those National Insurance hikes introduced by the Labour government. In short, this is a bit more complicated than some of the more breathless commentary in recent weeks might have you believe. Even so, regardless of how you balance those explanations, there is no doubting that Britain finds itself in a tricky position. This combination - of high inflation, weak economic growth and a large and swelling budget deficit - is precisely the economic cocktail that landed the Labour government of the mid-1970s with an IMF bailout. We are a long, long way from anything like that happening this time around. But the ingredients are familiar enough that no one should be altogether complacent. After all, the last time a government got overly complacent about these factors, back in 2022, we all know what happened next. The mini-Budget, a vertiginous spike in bond yields and a period where Britain's financial markets stared into the precipice. Best not to repeat that again."

        "Content": "\n          Business and economics reporter\n              @SkyNewsBiz\n The group of Thames Water lenders aiming to rescue the company have set out plans for £20.5bn of investment to bolster performance. The proposals, submitted to the regulator for consideration, include commitments to spending £9.4bn on sewage and water assets over the next five years, up 45% on current levels, to prevent spills and leaks respectively. Of this, £3.9bn would go towards the worst performing sewage treatment sites following a series of fines against Thames Water, and other major operators, over substandard storm overflow systems. It said this would be achieved at the 2025-30 bill levels already in place, so no further increases would be needed, but it continued to argue that leniency over poor performance will be needed to effect the turnaround. The creditors have named their consortium London & Valley Water. It effectively already owns Thames Water under the terms of a financial restructuring agreed early in the summer but Ofwat is yet to give its verdict on whether the consortium can run the company, averting the prospect of it being placed in a special administration regime.  Thames is on the brink of nationalisation because of the scale of its financial troubles, with debts above £17bn. Without a deal the consortium, which includes investment heavyweights Elliott Management and BlackRock, would be wiped out. Ofwat, which is to be scrapped under a shake-up of oversight, is looking at the operational plan separately to its proposed capital structure. The latter is expected to be revealed later this month. Sky News revealed on Monday that the consortium was to offer an additional £1bn-plus sweetener in a bid to persuade Ofwat and the government to back the rescue.  Mike McTighe, the chairman designate of London & Valley Water, said: \"Over the next 10 years the investment we will channel into Thames Water's network will make it one of the biggest infrastructure projects in the country. \"Our core focus will be on improving performance for customers, maintaining the highest standards of drinking water, reducing pollution and overcoming the many other challenges Thames Water faces. \"This turnaround has the opportunity to transform essential services for 16 million customers, clean up our waterways and rebuild public trust.\" Read more from Sky News:Value of pound sinksUK hit by toxic cocktail of market shifts The government has clearly signalled its preference that a market-based solution is secured for Thames Water, though it has lined up a restructuring firm to advise on planning in the event the proposed rescue deal fails.

        "Content": "\n          Foreign news reporter\n              @MikeRDrummond\n The alleged GPS jamming of a plane carrying Ursula von der Leyen by Russia raises concerns about air travel - but were there politics at play? Jamming can overwhelm an aircraft's GPS navigation systems, preventing them from working properly, leaving pilots to rely on other ways of finding out where they are. The European Commission president's aircraft was reportedly forced to land at a Bulgarian airport using 'paper maps' - after circling for an hour on Sunday. The EU said there was GPS jamming but the plane was able to land safely, adding: \"We have received information from Bulgarian authorities that they suspect this blatant interference was carried out by Russia.\" But the timing of the allegation of GPS jamming - something reported to be routine along the Russian border - days before a crucial meeting of European leaders to discuss peacekeeping troops for Ukraine raises the question of why now?  Sky News has spoken to a pilot who was flying in the same area as Ms von der Leyen on Sunday, as well as a security expert with extensive knowledge of electronic warfare, to try and work out what happened. What is GPS jamming? \n                  Stage set as Kim Jong Un arrives in Beijing for major military parade with Putin and Xi\n                 \n                  Russia responds to GPS jamming accusations - but such instances are expected to escalate\n                 \n                  Chinese, Russian and Indian leaders seek to show unity and push for new world order in Beijing meeting\n                 GPS interference has become a known and widespread issue affecting aircraft over Europe in recent years, particularly since the outbreak of the war in Ukraine in 2022. Experts generally point the finger at Russia, saying that Moscow uses GPS interference to defend against Ukrainian drones but maybe also to cause a nuisance for the West. Jamming can overwhelm an aircraft's GPS navigation systems, preventing them from working properly, leaving pilots to rely on other ways of finding out where they are. Read more: How 1,500 flights a day are reportedly GPS jammed  What happened to Ursula von der Leyen? According to the Financial Times, the 'attack' disabled GPS navigation services at Plovdiv airport in Bulgaria on Sunday afternoon. The aircraft was deprived of electronic navigational aids as it approached, the newspaper said. It circled the airport for an hour before the pilot decided to manually land the plane, apparently using paper maps. The area is near a known hotspot for GPS interference and blame was quickly levelled at Russia - a claim that Moscow denied. Russia has denied other instances of GPS jamming in the past. NATO chief Mark Rutte said the alliance takes the jamming of GPS signals \"very seriously\" and is working \"day and night\" to prevent that jamming, to ensure \"they will not do it again\". Read more:Asian countries and Russia eye new economic world orderTrump sets red line on Ukraine peace deal support Pilot: Airport is in a known GPS interference area Sean Fitzpatrick is an experienced pilot who regularly flies through areas known for GPS interference. Indeed, he flew within 40 miles of Plovdiv airport on the same day as Ms Von der Leyen. He told Sky News: \"That airport is in a known GPS interference area. Anyone flying in there would know that there's a high probability of having GPS issues.\" While GPS jamming is a nuisance, pilots essentially turn off GPS receivers and rely on other aids like the instrument landing system, Sean said. He added: \"When I heard they were pulling out paper charts (to navigate) I'm like, why didn't they just have an iPad?\" Given that GPS jamming of flights near the Russian border is reported to be routine, Sean was asked if the choice to reveal this particular alleged incident to the media - so close to the coalition of the willing summit this week - was political. \"Based on the information I have, that's what it looks like... Based on what I've seen and the information that's available to the public and what I know as a professional... I think there's a bit of politics and sensationalism.\" 'We can make your life difficult' Dr Thomas Withington, an expert on electronic warfare at the RUSI thinktank, agreed that there could be political angles to what happened. \"I think it's quite hard to say with any degree of certainty whether her aircraft was deliberately targeted,\" he told Sky News, noting that jamming signals are often sent out over a wide area. \"But I'm sure that for Mr Putin it's a very happy coincidence.\" He added: \"Politically, what you're saying is 'we're here, we can make your life difficult'.\" He also spoke about the wider impact of GPS jamming - and the possible dangers. \"I think it is important that the news went out there, because I think it indicates that Russia is an irresponsible actor, and these actions are grossly irresponsible, because you're attempting to create a danger to international air travel, and there is simply no justification for that.\" He referenced the Azerbaijan Airlines flight in December, which was reportedly GPS jammed before it was mistakenly shot down by Russian air defences, killing 38 people. \"If those (Russian) actions cause loss of life, particularly in a NATO nation, I think it should be made very clear that a military response would be considered for that.\""

        "Content": "\n          North of England correspondent\n              @ShingiMararike\n  The mother of murdered teenager Brianna Ghey is calling on the government to introduce a ban on mobile phones in schools - a move she says will not only safeguard children, but also improve their behaviour and engagement in class. In February 2023, Brianna, 16, was stabbed to death by two 15-year-olds after being lured to a park in Warrington. In the lead-up to the attack, her killers had spent time on the dark web. At the same time, Brianna was also trapped online, struggling with a phone addiction. Her mother Esther Ghey's Phone Free Education campaign is driven by her personal experiences as a parent and the impact Brianna's phone use had on her education. \"All the arguments that me and Brianna had were down to her phone use,\" Esther said. \"But even in school, she had issues and I used to have phone calls from the school saying that Brianna wouldn't put her phone away.\" Brianna, who was transgender, struggled with an eating disorder and also self-harmed. Her mother says the constant time she spent online exacerbated those issues, while impacting her behaviour at school, where she had 120 safeguarding logs and 116 behaviour incidents recorded by her teachers. \"It was so difficult as a parent, because I felt in one way that I was failing and then in another way, and this is really difficult for me to speak about, I was so annoyed with Brianna,\" she recalled. \"I thought, why can't you just go to school, get your head down and just focus on your education, because this is important. \"Only now, after two years of being immersed in this world, do I realise that actually, it's so much harder than that.\" Research by the Children's Commission has shown that 79% of secondary schools are still allowing pupils to bring their mobile phones into school, and even into classrooms. How phone ban is working at Brianna's old school Esther is campaigning for government guidance on phones to become statutory, with funding also set aside for the equipment to help schools implement the ban, arguing the lack of legislation is \"setting children up to fail\". At Birchwood Community High School in Warrington, where Brianna was a pupil, they introduced a ban on phones last September. At the beginning of the day, pupils turn off their phones and place them in pouches, which are locked. At the end of the school day, the pouches are then unlocked. The headteacher, Emma Mills, said introducing these measures has come with several benefits. \"It's had an impact in all areas of school, and it's actually had a really positive impact in ways that I didn't foresee,\" said Ms Mills. \"Attendance has improved this year. In terms of behaviour, behaviour has improved. We've had no permanent exclusions this year in school, which is actually the first time since I've been headteacher in six years, there's been no permanent exclusion.\" This summer, the school also saw its best-ever GCSE results in the core subjects of science, maths, and English. 'They can live without their phones' For Ms Mills, another significant change has been the atmosphere in the school. \"They're not as worried, they're not as distracted,\" Ms Mills said. \"They've realised that they can live without their phones. Something else we've really noticed is that it's a bit louder in school at breaks and lunch times. It's because they're talking more, they're interacting more, and they're communicating more.\" The positive impact of a ban at Brianna's old school has served as encouragement to Esther, who has written an open letter addressed to Sir Keir Starmer and Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson, asking for government support. Read more:Screen time limit for children being considered'Whole society' approach needed to stop doomscrolling High-profile signatories include the actress Kate Winslet, as well as actor and film producer Stephen Graham. For Esther, who will deliver the letter to 10 Downing Street next month, the campaign is not just Brianna's legacy, but also creating societal change. \"I think it's important that we teach young people to live in the real world,\" she said. \"It's going to impact society at one point and I think this small amount of investment in students now will have a massive impact in the future.\""

Last summer, when riots were raging across the country following the Southport murders, police dealt with 2,942 protests. In 2023, it was 928. The summer months this year have been dominated by widespread demonstrations, some against the ban on Palestine Action and others against housing asylum seekers in hotels.

The senior official said protests this year were a \"chronic pressure\" for police compared to last year's disorder, which was acute. \"This is not talking about the volume of protest, and this is not a commentary from policing on people's right to protest peacefully,\" he said. \"We absolutely support that in a democracy, but we do know that there is a climate of increasing tension and polarity in what we're seeing.\" He is convinced communities will be able to reunite and \"reset\", and said claims that the UK is on the verge of civil disobedience are \"exaggerated\".

        "Content": "The total cost of relocating Afghan nationals to the UK is estimated to be more than £2bn, according to a report by the National Audit Office (NAO). This includes 7,355 people eligible for resettlement in the UK under the Afghanistan Response Route (ARR) scheme, which was launched for those whose personal information was leaked in a February 2022 data breach. The Ministry of Defence (MoD) estimates the cost of resettling people in the UK through the ARR scheme to be around £850m, not including legal costs or compensation claims. But the ministry does not know the exact cost resulting from the data breach resettlement scheme because it did not separately identify the costs in its accounting system, the NAO said. It added that the MoD had not provided enough evidence to give the NAO \"confidence in its estimate of £850m in relation to past and future costs\". The total cost of all Afghan resettlement activity between 2021 and 2029 - including the ARR - is expected to exceed £2bn. About £563m of this has already been spent on Afghan resettlement schemes between 2021-22, for those who helped the British military during the war, and 2024-25, for those put at risk because of the data breach. The MoD expects to spend a further £1.5bn by March 2029. Data breach undiscovered for 18 months The cost skyrocketed due to the creation of the ARR scheme and those eligible under it, which came after an unnamed British official accidentally emailed details of 18,714 Afghan nationals who applied to be relocated to the UK under the previous scheme outside a secure government system. He sent the email in February 2022 in an attempt to verify information, believing the dataset to only contain around 150 rows of information, but it actually contained around 33,000. The MoD discovered the leak in August 2023 after seeing details of the emails had been posted by a Facebook user.  UK officials sent around 1,800 ARAP applicants in Pakistan a warning via WhatsApp to say their data may have been breached. Shortly after, two journalists inquired about the breach, causing then-defence secretary Ben Wallace to seek a court order, with the High Court granting a super-injunction. The super-injunction was only lifted in July 2025. Read more:Afghan man in data breach says he feels betrayedVictims of Afghan data leak receive scam emails In April 2024, the government secretly launched the ARR scheme specifically for those whose personal information was leaked in the data breach, who were ineligible for other resettlement schemes and who were at significant risk of reprisal by the ruling Taliban regime in Afghanistan. The MoD did not record separately who was resettled via the ARR scheme, arguing this was to maintain the secrecy of the ARR scheme while the super-injunction was in place, preventing disclosure of both the data breach and the existence of the injunction itself. £400m spent on resettling Afghans affected by breach The ministry estimates that £400m of the £850m estimated total cost of resettling Afghan nationals via the ARR scheme had been spent by July 2025, but the NAO said it had not been provided with sufficient evidence to support either estimate. In early July 2025, the government closed the ARR scheme to new applicants. The NAO report was welcomed by Sir Geoffrey Clifton-Brown, chair of the Public Accounts Committee, who said: \"After the High Court super-injunction was lifted earlier this year, confusion still remains over the reported £850m historic and future costs relating to the breach, with the MoD unable to provide sufficient assurance over their numbers. \"This figure does not include all legal costs or compensation claims, which currently remain unknown.\" He added that the Public Affairs Committee would be examining this issue in its inquiry next week."

        "Content": "Epping Council has been denied the chance to appeal a ruling to the Supreme Court over asylum seekers being housed at the Bell Hotel.  The Essex hotel has become the focal point of protests, and counter-protests, in recent weeks after an asylum seeker staying there was charged with sexually assaulting a teenager. He denies the allegation. Epping Forest District Council was last month granted a temporary injunction to stop asylum seekers from being housed at the accommodation - but this was overturned on Friday after legal challenges from the Home Office and the hotel's owner, Somani Hotels. The council has now said \"no reasons were given\" after its application for permission to appeal the most recent judgment was denied. What is Labour doing on migration? A statement on its website said: \"It is now open for the council to ask the Supreme Court itself for permission to appeal against the judgment of the Court of Appeal. \"The council has consistently opposed the use of The Bell Hotel to place asylum-seekers, which is in breach of planning control and is against the interests of those living in, working in and using the area.\" \n                  Driver charged with failing to stop at crash that killed children on e-scooter\n                 \n                  Epping migrant hotel resident told girl, 14, he wanted her to have his baby, court hears\n                 \n                  Labour smell dirty tricks over asylum hotel court ruling - but the risks are clear\n                  Council leader Chris Whitbread said in a statement that Tuesday's decision was \"wrong\" and accused the Court of Appeal judges of putting \"the secretary of state’s duties towards asylum seekers above those of the council to uphold the planning system\". Adding that \"this is not the end of the matter\", Mr Whitbread said: \"We consider we have a strong case for a final injunction. \"The final injunction hearing is expected to be heard some time in early October. \"The council is keeping all our options open, including seeking permission from the Supreme Court to appeal against the judgment of the Court of Appeal.\"  Mr Whitbread also appealed to protesters to act \"considerately and calmly\" should they continue with regular demonstrations as schools return. Multiple protests have been held outside the Bell Hotel since mid-July, when Hadush Gerberslasie Kebatu was charged with the alleged sexual assault of a 14-year-old girl.   His trial began last week and is due to conclude later this week. Kebatu, 38, denies two counts of sexual assault, one count of attempted sexual assault, one count of inciting a girl to engage in sexual activity, and one count of harassment without violence. Protests and counter-protests have also taken place outside other hotels across the country housing asylum seekers.   Two charged over Bell Hotel protests Earlier on Tuesday, a man and a woman were charged over their part in demonstrations at the lodgings on Sunday. Essex Police said Sarah White, 40, of Chigwell, and Scott Davey, 32, of nearby Nazeing, were arrested on suspicion of breaching a Section 14 order, which was put in place by police to designate where people could assemble. A 22-year-old man from Epping was arrested on suspicion of inciting racial hatred and racially or religiously aggravated criminal damage, over allegations that a banner was set alight on Friday, the force said.

Martin Peagram pleaded guilty at Chelmsford Crown Court to violent disorder after protesting outside the hotel on 17 July. Judge Jamie Sawyer told the court: \"Mr Peagram must understand the likely sentence will be an immediate prison sentence.\" "

Yusuf Ali Hamud arrived in the UK two decades ago to seek asylum, but after a criminal conviction for a serious assault, he was stripped of his right to work. He lives in Nuneaton and has claimed that over the last five months he has been asking to be deported to Somalia, but said he is still waiting for a Home Office response.

I want to go back.\" \"The Home Office, they are ignoring me,\" he said. He said if he didn't have the right to work or refugee status in the UK, \"why am I here?\" Mr Hamud said he didn't want to \"come here to eat and sleep, like [a] baby\" and would rather return to his home country which has been gripped by an ongoing civil war since 1991. Data from a league table published earlier this year shows there were 19,244 foreign offenders awaiting deportation at the end of 2024, a rise from 17,907 when the Conservatives left office in July and 14,640 at the end of 2022. Asked about Mr Hamud's case, the Home Office told Sky News it cannot comment on individual cases, but said it always seeks to ensure the removal of those who have committed serious crimes in the country, whether that's through enforced deportations or voluntary returns. Under plans yet to come into force, the government has said it will deport foreign criminals immediately after sentencing. A few years ago, the number of asylum seekers in Nuneaton was in the single digits, but the figures have since grown to 247 by June this year. The latest figures show there are 19 asylum seekers per 10,000 residents, placing Nuneaton 87th in the country in terms of concentration. Nuneaton has become a flashpoint for anti-migrant unrest after two men, reported to be Afghan asylum seekers, were accused of sexually assaulting a 12-year-old girl. A Sky News interview with Zahin, a 32-year-old businessman, was interrupted by a group of women who shouted and swore at the camera. \"You're trying to rape our kids,\" shouted one of the women. They were accompanied by children and one held a pint of lager. \"That's the issue with having youse [sic] in our country, you're raping our kids,\" one woman shouted.  Zahin, who relocated to Nuneaton from Malawi when he was six years old, asked the women: \"What you teaching them kids?\" He later said he believes he was targeted because the women assumed he was Muslim and added: \"For them to accuse us of a crime, that's unfair, that is unjust.\" \"I love this town,\" he said."

        "Content": "\n          Business and economics reporter\n              @taaffems\n  The value of the pound has sunk - as the cost of 30-year government borrowing reached a high last seen in 1998. The so-called spot rate saw one pound buy $1.336 on Tuesday, a low last seen in early August, and down from $1.353 earlier in the day. Despite the dip, it's still higher than the vast majority of the past year: in early September 2024, a pound bought $1.31. Money blog: 'She didn't get me a wedding gift - even though I spent thousands on her' The decline, however, means sterling is on course for the biggest one-day drop since April, when Donald Trump's announcement of country-specific tariffs spooked markets. The drop was similarly steep against the euro, with a pound momentarily buying €1.1486, a low not seen since November 2023, nearly two years ago. It's also a fall from €1.1586 earlier in the trading session. Before the so-called liberation day announcement, £1 equalled nearly €1.19. It comes as the yield - the interest rate demanded by investors - on 30-year government bonds - loans taken by the state - hit 5.72%, the highest rate this century. Why? Yields are rising across the globe in the face of weak economic growth and the US trade war. Investors are also concerned about UK government finances as Chancellor Rachel Reeves battles to stick to her fiscal rules to bring down debt and balance the budget. High inflation and increased public debt from the pandemic have left a deficit between state spending and income. There have been high-profile government U-turns on winter fuel payments and welfare spending cuts that have meant the chancellor has to look elsewhere to meet her self-imposed fiscal rules. Read more:Thames Water creditors offer £1bn 'sweetener'Empty flats that developers say sum up UK's housing crisis More expensive interest payments from rising bond yields have meant the country is stuck in a cycle of rising debt. Today's rises to the cost of government borrowing could not have come at a worse time for the public finances. While a £14bn sale of new 10-year government debt - a record sum - was completed, it was achieved at the highest yield since 2008. Lale Akoner, global market analyst at investment platform eToro, said of the auction: \"For the government, this creates a paradox - market confidence in UK debt is robust, but financing that debt is increasingly expensive, constraining budget flexibility and raising the stakes for fiscal discipline ahead of the autumn budget.\" The yield on 10-year gilts, as they are known in the UK, later rose to its highest since January at 4.825%, up on the day but in line with their transatlantic equivalent, US Treasuries. The global bond sell-off was also being reflected on stock markets. The Dow Jones Industrial Average and tech-focused Nasdaq were both down by more than 1% at the open on Wall St. In Europe, Germany's DAX closed more than 2% lower while the FTSE 100 was almost 0.9% down - shielded to some degree by the weaker pound. The more domestically-focused FTSE 150, however, was down by more than 2%. The flight from risk also saw the spot price of gold, traditionally a safe haven for investors in times of uncertainty, briefly climb to a new record high of $3,578.40 per ounce."

        "Content": "\n          Economics and data editor\n              @EdConwaySky\n  No chancellor much likes it when the pound takes a tumble. No chancellor much likes it when the yield on their government debt - the interest rate paid by the state - climbs to historic highs. When these two things happen on the same day, and in the run-up to a hotly-awaited Budget… well, that's the last thing any chancellor ever wants to see coming up on their screen. Yet that was the toxic cocktail that awaited Rachel Reeves on the terminal screens in the Treasury on Tuesday morning. The pound dropped by more than a percent against the US dollar, while the yield on 30-year government debt (known as gilts) rose to the highest level since 1998. The real question now is: how much does she have to worry about it and, more to the point, what can she do about it? Let's start with the first question first. Bond yields are a measure of the interest rate paid on debt and, in the case of government debt, they are influenced by all sorts of things. This makes interpreting their movements quite tricky, at the best of times. For in one respect, they are a proxy for how creditworthy (or not) investors think a government is. If they think a country is about to default on its debt (Greek bonds and the euro crisis are perhaps the best example) then they might sell a country's bonds and, lo and behold, the interest rate on those bonds goes up.  But in another respect they also reflect what people think will happen to inflation and interest rates in the coming years (or, in the case of long-dated bonds like the 30-year gilt, the coming decades). So, if you think inflation is going to be higher for longer, then all else equal, you would expect gilt yields to be higher, since that implies the Bank of England will have to keep its interest rates higher. It all feeds into the government bond yield. \n                  Bank shares take fright as budget tax hike is floated\n                 \n                  Surprise good news as government borrowing less than forecast\n                 \n                  Something for everyone in UK's latest GDP data\n                 Nor is that the end of it, because these yields are also affected by all sorts of other things: how much demand is there from pension funds? What's the impact of the ageing population? How fast is the country going to grow? All of these things (and more) can have a bearing on the bond yield. Money latest: Hopes for interest rate cut suffer blow All of which is to say, there's rarely a single explanation for phenomena like the one we've got today. Consider the higher 30-year bond yields faced by the UK. On the one hand, there's a compelling explanation served up by the Whitehall and parliamentary drama of recent months. The government has failed to pass some key legislation cutting welfare spending. It has also had to do a U-turn on cutting winter fuel payments. Those two decisions mean it is left with a sizeable hole in the public finances in the coming years. That in turn makes it considerably more likely that it might have to borrow more, which in turn means investors might be getting more worried about Britain's indebtedness. That's totally consistent with higher gilt yields. And so perhaps it's no surprise that the UK's 30-year bond yield is considerably higher than other G7 nations.  But it's not quite that simple. For one thing, Britain is far from the only country in the G7 with a public finances problem. France and the US have deficit trajectories that look considerably less controlled than Britain's. Nor is it evident from other measures of fiscal concern - for instance, the credit default swaps insuring against a country going bust - that Britain is an outlier. Read more:Thames Water creditors offer £1bn 'sweetener'Empty flats that developers say sum up UK's housing crisis Now consider another datapoint: inflation. Britain has the highest inflation rate in the G7, by some margin. In other words, part of the explanation for the UK's high yields is that markets are fretting not just about fiscal policy (the stuff done in Whitehall) but monetary policy (the stuff done by the Bank of England in the city). Now, in practice these two worlds bleed into each other. Part (though certainly not all) of the reason inflation is high is those National Insurance hikes introduced by the Labour government. In short, this is a bit more complicated than some of the more breathless commentary in recent weeks might have you believe. Even so, regardless of how you balance those explanations, there is no doubting that Britain finds itself in a tricky position. This combination - of high inflation, weak economic growth and a large and swelling budget deficit - is precisely the economic cocktail that landed the Labour government of the mid-1970s with an IMF bailout. We are a long, long way from anything like that happening this time around. But the ingredients are familiar enough that no one should be altogether complacent. After all, the last time a government got overly complacent about these factors, back in 2022, we all know what happened next. The mini-Budget, a vertiginous spike in bond yields and a period where Britain's financial markets stared into the precipice. Best not to repeat that again."

        "Content": "\n          Foreign news reporter\n              @MikeRDrummond\n The alleged GPS jamming of a plane carrying Ursula von der Leyen by Russia raises concerns about air travel - but were there politics at play? Jamming can overwhelm an aircraft's GPS navigation systems, preventing them from working properly, leaving pilots to rely on other ways of finding out where they are. The European Commission president's aircraft was reportedly forced to land at a Bulgarian airport using 'paper maps' - after circling for an hour on Sunday. The EU said there was GPS jamming but the plane was able to land safely, adding: \"We have received information from Bulgarian authorities that they suspect this blatant interference was carried out by Russia.\" But the timing of the allegation of GPS jamming - something reported to be routine along the Russian border - days before a crucial meeting of European leaders to discuss peacekeeping troops for Ukraine raises the question of why now?  Sky News has spoken to a pilot who was flying in the same area as Ms von der Leyen on Sunday, as well as a security expert with extensive knowledge of electronic warfare, to try and work out what happened. What is GPS jamming? \n                  Stage set as Kim Jong Un arrives in Beijing for major military parade with Putin and Xi\n                 \n                  Russia responds to GPS jamming accusations - but such instances are expected to escalate\n                 \n                  Chinese, Russian and Indian leaders seek to show unity and push for new world order in Beijing meeting\n                 GPS interference has become a known and widespread issue affecting aircraft over Europe in recent years, particularly since the outbreak of the war in Ukraine in 2022. Experts generally point the finger at Russia, saying that Moscow uses GPS interference to defend against Ukrainian drones but maybe also to cause a nuisance for the West. Jamming can overwhelm an aircraft's GPS navigation systems, preventing them from working properly, leaving pilots to rely on other ways of finding out where they are. Read more: How 1,500 flights a day are reportedly GPS jammed  What happened to Ursula von der Leyen? According to the Financial Times, the 'attack' disabled GPS navigation services at Plovdiv airport in Bulgaria on Sunday afternoon. The aircraft was deprived of electronic navigational aids as it approached, the newspaper said. It circled the airport for an hour before the pilot decided to manually land the plane, apparently using paper maps. The area is near a known hotspot for GPS interference and blame was quickly levelled at Russia - a claim that Moscow denied. Russia has denied other instances of GPS jamming in the past. NATO chief Mark Rutte said the alliance takes the jamming of GPS signals \"very seriously\" and is working \"day and night\" to prevent that jamming, to ensure \"they will not do it again\". Read more:Asian countries and Russia eye new economic world orderTrump sets red line on Ukraine peace deal support Pilot: Airport is in a known GPS interference area Sean Fitzpatrick is an experienced pilot who regularly flies through areas known for GPS interference. Indeed, he flew within 40 miles of Plovdiv airport on the same day as Ms Von der Leyen. He told Sky News: \"That airport is in a known GPS interference area. Anyone flying in there would know that there's a high probability of having GPS issues.\" While GPS jamming is a nuisance, pilots essentially turn off GPS receivers and rely on other aids like the instrument landing system, Sean said. He added: \"When I heard they were pulling out paper charts (to navigate) I'm like, why didn't they just have an iPad?\" Given that GPS jamming of flights near the Russian border is reported to be routine, Sean was asked if the choice to reveal this particular alleged incident to the media - so close to the coalition of the willing summit this week - was political. \"Based on the information I have, that's what it looks like... Based on what I've seen and the information that's available to the public and what I know as a professional... I think there's a bit of politics and sensationalism.\" 'We can make your life difficult' Dr Thomas Withington, an expert on electronic warfare at the RUSI thinktank, agreed that there could be political angles to what happened. \"I think it's quite hard to say with any degree of certainty whether her aircraft was deliberately targeted,\" he told Sky News, noting that jamming signals are often sent out over a wide area. \"But I'm sure that for Mr Putin it's a very happy coincidence.\" He added: \"Politically, what you're saying is 'we're here, we can make your life difficult'.\" He also spoke about the wider impact of GPS jamming - and the possible dangers. \"I think it is important that the news went out there, because I think it indicates that Russia is an irresponsible actor, and these actions are grossly irresponsible, because you're attempting to create a danger to international air travel, and there is simply no justification for that.\" He referenced the Azerbaijan Airlines flight in December, which was reportedly GPS jammed before it was mistakenly shot down by Russian air defences, killing 38 people. \"If those (Russian) actions cause loss of life, particularly in a NATO nation, I think it should be made very clear that a military response would be considered for that.\""

The US last month doubled its reward for information leading to the arrest of Mr Maduro to $50m, accusing him of links to drug trafficking and criminal groups. The US has deployed warships in the southern Caribbean in recent weeks. Seven warships, along with one nuclear-powered fast-attack submarine, are either in the region or expected to arrive soon, carrying more than 4,500 sailors and Marines.

        "Content": "By Gemma Peplow, culture and entertainment reporter, and Katie Spencer, entertainment correspondent  Before he died alone in his jacuzzi, Matthew Perry had received three injections of ketamine in the space of just six hours. \"Shoot me up with a big one,\" he told his personal assistant, ahead of the final, fatal dose. According to court documents, in the period leading up to 28 October 2023, Kenneth Iwamasa was illegally administering Perry with between six and eight shots of the drug, an anaesthetic that can have hallucinogenic effects, each day. A live-in assistant, he admitted to finding the actor unconscious at his Pacific Palisades home on at least two occasions in the weeks prior. The hit that ultimately killed the Friends star was supplied by Jasveen Sangha, also known as the \"Ketamine Queen\" - a dealer who apparently only dealt \"with high-end and celebs\". She has agreed to plead guilty to five charges and will appear in court later today. Her charges, along with others filed against Iwamasa and others over the supply of ketamine to Perry, exposed part of Hollywood's underground drug network - and put the spotlight on the world of celebrity, money and power. 'Yes men' with terrible consequences Perry's death was met with both utter shock and a sad sense of the inevitable. The world knew him best as Chandler Bing, the comic heartbeat of Friends. But behind the jokes and the sarcasm, he was deeply troubled. \"It almost felt like we'd been mourning Matthew for a long time because his battle with that disease was a really hard one for him to fight,\" is how his former co-star Jennifer Aniston described his addiction in a recent interview. \"As hard as it was for all of us and for the fans, there's a part of me that thinks this is better... I'm glad he's out of that pain.\" The actor was an addict, and vulnerable - but also a huge star, worth millions. Iwamasa was administering the injections, ultimately playing God - but to him, the power most likely lay with his famous boss. His actions may seem inexcusable, but did he feel he had a choice? \"I think it was a situation that increasingly got more and more out of control,\" says Bonnie Low-Kramen, a former celebrity assistant turned trainer, and author of Be The Ultimate Assistant. Those who do the job, especially in Los Angeles, can be put under an enormous amount of pressure, she says, \"tasked with doing things many of us wouldn't imagine carrying out for our employers. It is a job which comes with an inherent power imbalance\". Which means it can be incredibly hard to say no. \"When people are rich and famous, they often have people around them who won't say no,\" she says. \"And assistants are in the yes business anyway. \"We're in the business of figuring out, 'well, let's solve the problem...'. When money is no object, there are new rules that apply in that situation and that can be really hard to handle.\" Iwamasa is not the first celebrity assistant asked to administer or pick up illegal drugs, she says, and Perry is not the first star to die after taking drugs. Ms Low-Kramen highlights the deaths of Janis Joplin, Prince and John Belushi as just a few other examples. \"Unfortunately, there are so many examples of this tragic end, where the abuse of drugs gets to a point where they've handled it for a really long time, and then the day comes when it can't be handled anymore.\" For those struggling with addiction, being surrounded by \"yes men\" can have terrible consequences, says Garrett Braukman, an addiction treatment executive in Hollywood. \"Treatment is difficult for people when they have yes men. They have a lot of people that are going to tell them you can get whatever you want, you can get drugs, you can get alcohol, you could do whatever, and no one is willing to really look at that from the perspective of how dangerous that is.\" Read more:Obituary: The one who made everyone laughMatthew Perry: A life in pictures Mr Braukman says addiction can go hand in hand with fame and that a \"high\" percentage of his patients work in the entertainment industry. \"I don't know how I would be able to stay clean and sober if I go to my grandma's house and there's 20 guys outside of my grandma's house taking pictures of me walking in. You become an animal to a degree that people are watching.\" Rise in use of ketamine The use of ketamine recreationally has been on the rise in recent years, in the UK as well as the US. In England, some 3,609 people started treatment for problems with the drug in the year 2023-2024 - more than eight times the number in 2014-2015, when 426 sought help, according to government statistics. In January, drag queen The Vivienne was found dead in the bath at their home in Cheshire, aged 32. The star's family later told how the performer had died \"from the effects of ketamine use causing a cardiac arrest\". Ketamine is usually taken recreationally as a crushed powder, but also sometimes injected or swallowed - making people feel detached and dreamlike. It can also cause severe bladder and kidney problems. Perry's struggles with alcohol and other drugs, before ketamine, were long running and well documented, starting with drinking as a teenager before moving on to painkilling prescription drugs Vicodin and OxyContin, and tranquilliser Xanax. \"I have spent upward of $7m (£5.8m) trying to get sober,\" he wrote in his memoir, released when he was clean, just a year before his death. While accepting the almost unsurpassable legacy of the hit show that made him a star, he said he hoped his support for fellow addicts would be the achievement he was best remembered for. \"When I die, I don't want Friends to be the first thing that's mentioned - I want helping others to be the first thing that's mentioned and I'm going to live the rest of my life proving that.\" He only lived for another year. Illegal use v therapy Before he died, Perry had been undergoing legal ketamine infusion therapy to treat depression and anxiety. The drug can be used as a treatment in clinical settings in the US, and some specialist and private centres in the UK - although there are concerns from some medics here about its use even in those settings. According to a postmortem report, the actor had reportedly been clean for 19 months before he started obtaining the drug illegally as well. It was not the supervised doses that killed him, but the idea of an addict taking the drug to help their problems might still sound shocking. In California, ketamine drips are legally used as pain relief, to treat mood disorders and to help with addiction. Other celebrities and notable figures - including Chrissy Teigen, Elon Musk and Sharon Osbourne - have all shared details of ketamine therapy and how it helped them. Dr Austin Harris, owner and medical director at NeuroRelief Ketamine Infusion Therapy, says historically the drug is \"extremely safe\" when used in the right conditions, and swears by its effectiveness. At the clinic in California, he explained to Sky News how it can help people with mood disorders and chronic pain, as well as those in recovery from drug or alcohol abuse. \"Which a lot of people who don't really understand this at a scientific level might think is an oxymoron,\" he says. \"But actually, it's profoundly beneficial - done properly - in resetting both neurologic and psychological patterns for substance abuse.\" Ketamine infusion \"restarts in our brain what should already be there\", he says, in terms of \"the neurologic road workers, to be able to then direct, to build new patterns and actual new nerve pathways\". One patient having therapy at the clinic also spoke to us, saying he had abused alcohol and marijuana, and occasionally opiate painkillers, for many years. \"I've had enough experience and decades of being addicted to drugs and alcohol and traumas and trying different things,\" he said. \"When I came out of that infusion I was like, wait a minute. I didn't have the shakes. I didn't have the cravings.\" Read more:Parties and busted doors: Living next to 'Ketamine Queen'The drug addiction leaving users in chronic pain Dr Harris emphasises the need for administration by a professional in a clinical setting. \"Matthew Perry was being illegally sold ketamine on the black market. The fact that a doctor happened to be one of several people that was illegally selling it to him should not be confused with the appropriate legal utilisation of ketamine.\" The actor was vulnerable, Dr Harris continues. \"It's absolutely abominable... You have someone with serious addiction problems, lifelong. And sadly, I think that he was really taken advantage of.\" The drugs stash  As well as Sangha and Iwamasa, the others charged over Perry's death are Erik Fleming, an associate of Perry's who was in contact with Sangha, Dr Mark Chavez, a physician, and Dr Salvador Plasencia, who also supplied ketamine illegally to Perry. \"I wonder how much this moron will pay,\" Dr Plasencia said in a text exchange between him and Chavez. After Perry died, Sangha desperately sought to cover her involvement. \"Delete all our messages,\" she instructed Fleming in a message on Signal. In March 2024, law enforcement searched Sangha's home and found 1.7kg of pressed pills containing methamphetamine, 79 vials of liquid ketamine, MDMA (ecstasy) tablets, counterfeit Xanax pills, baggies containing powdered ketamine and cocaine, and other drug-trafficking items such as a gold money counting machine, a scale, a wireless signal and hidden camera detector, drug packaging materials, and $5,723 in cash, according to her plea agreement. Sangha was happy to supply to Hollywood's rich and famous - and not an anomaly. Several books have been written by Tinseltown dealers, and only a few months ago, the Sean \"Diddy\" Combs trial heard from a former personal assistant to the hip-hop mogul who testified about meeting sellers for his boss. Now, as she becomes the last defendant to admit her role in Perry's death, the Ketamine Queen's guilty plea brings to a close the criminal investigation into the circumstances surrounding the tragedy. But in a world where money talks, where fame and addiction or mental health issues often go hand-in-hand, it is unlikely to be the last."

I think I'm having trouble realising how huge this is.\" Ms Arnould's lawyer, Carine Durrieu-Diebolt, told French outlet Franceinfo she was \"extremely satisfied\" and said the decision was a \"moment of judicial truth in this case\". In 2018, prosecutors in Paris opened a preliminary investigation after Ms Arnould accused Depardieu of raping her at his home. He has denied wrongdoing. \"The acts of rape and sexual assault have been acknowledged,\" Ms Arnould said. \"Now, we await the next steps.\" Last year, prosecutors submitted a request for the case to proceed to trial. Earlier this year, Depardieu was convicted of sexually assaulting two women on a film set and received an 18-month suspended prison sentence. The 76-year-old was convicted of groping a 34-year-old assistant and a 54-year-old woman responsible for decorating the set during the filming of Les Volets Verts (The Green Shutters) in 2021.

In recent years, Depardieu has been accused of misconduct, either publicly or in formal complaints, by more than 20 women.

        "Content": " At least seven people have been killed, parliament buildings have been set alight and more than 1,000 people have been arrested as anti-government protests sweep across Indonesia.  The unrest began in Jakarta, the country's capital, more than a week ago - but has grown into wider demonstrations in at least 32 of Indonesia's 38 provinces, according to the country's home minister. Many of the protests turned violent after the death of Affan Kurniawan. The 21-year-old was trying to deliver food when he was caught up in a clash between police and protesters in Jakarta. Now, many Indonesians are calling for a list of 25 demands from the government, including the end of police brutality and ensuring decent wages for the public. The hashtag #ResetIndonesia is filling social media, with many users adding pink and green colours to their profile pictures in response to the protests. Here is everything you need to know. What sparked the protests? Public outrage grew when it emerged that all 580 members of the country's House of Representatives receive a monthly housing allowance of 50 million rupiah (approximately £2,270), in addition to their salaries. The benefit, introduced last year, is nearly 10 times the Jakarta minimum wage. Critics have argued it is not only excessive but also insensitive during a time of rising cost of living, taxes and unemployment. Protests also targeted what demonstrators called \"corrupt elites\" within the government and policies that, according to one student-led group, benefit conglomerates and the military. A statement by the group, called Gejayan Memanggil, appeared to reference the growing role of the military in civilian life under President Prabowo Subianto, who is a former military general. On 25 August, hundreds of protesters marched through the streets of Jakarta surrounding the parliament building. Witnesses claimed that some tried to get inside. Others, dressed in dark clothing, threw rocks and set off fireworks at riot police, who fired tear gas and used a water cannon to try and push back the crowd. Officials did not provide details of damage, any casualties or arrests. Violent escalation Violence between the two sides escalated after the death of Mr Kurniawan, who was reportedly hit by an armoured police vehicle, which sped through a crowd of protesters on Thursday 28 September. The following day clashes between riot police and protesters erupted in multiple cities across the country, including in Medan, Solo, Yogyakarta, Magelang, Malang, Bengkulu, Pekanbaru and Manokwari in the eastern Papua region. In the city of Makassar on Sulawesi island, at least three people died, and five others were injured after a local parliament building was set on fire. Protesters also stormed the regional police headquarters in Surabaya, Indonesia's second-largest city, after destroying fences and torching vehicles. Indonesian security forces used tear gas and water cannons against the protesters, who hit back with fireworks and wooden clubs. The violent scenes emerging from the country led to TikTok voluntarily suspending its feature for users to go live, citing measures to keep the platform a safe and civil space. Senior minister Airlangga Hartarto said on Monday that at least eight people had died in the clashes. Jakata's health office said 469 were injured, including 97 who needed hospital treatment. At least 1,240 protesters were arrested after five days of demonstrations in the capital, with city officials reporting $3.4m (£2.5m) in damage. 'Doxxing' of political figures Certain Indonesian officials became the targets of social media \"doxxing\" - the searching and publishing of private information with malicious intent - which revealed their addresses and led to the looting of their homes. One of those was finance minister Sri Mulyani Indrawati, whose home was broken into after a deep-fake video of her circulated where she said teachers were a burden. Ms Indrawati was not at the property at the time. The home of politician Ahmad Sahroni was also looted after he said calls to dissolve parliament over the financial benefit were being made by the \"stupidest people in the world\".  What has the government said? When visiting some of those injured during the violence, Mr Prabowo said the unrest was being fuelled by \"rioters, not protesters,\" and accused the groups who had organised the action of trying to destabilise the nation. He also cancelled a high-profile trip to China to attend a \"Victory Day\" parade alongside other world leaders to focus on ending the protests. It represents the most significant challenge yet to the president's government, which has faced little political opposition since taking office nearly a year ago. In a rare concession, Mr Prabowo told a televised news conference on 31 August that the government would cut politicians' perks and privileges, including the housing allowance that caused the demonstrations. He also said police were investigating seven officers linked to the death of Mr Kurniawan, but warned that security forces would act firmly to control law and order. Is there an end in sight? Despite concessions from the government, demonstrations across the country have continued. Groups of student protesters gathered in Jakarta on 1 September, as well as in Indonesia's cultural hub of Yogyakarta, and the cities of Bandung and Makassar, the site of the weekend's worst violence. \"The president's statement did not accommodate demands from students and civil society,\" Syamry, the leader of a student group from Makassar State University, said. They said students also had other, deeper demands, such as comprehensive police reform. Tensions remained high on Tuesday as police fired tear gas into crowds of protesters near the campuses of the Islamic University of Bandung - also known as UNISBA - and nearby Pasundan University, according to two student groups at the two institutions. Police official Hendra Rochmawan said authorities did not enter the campuses but had tried to break up crowds of non-student protesters seeking protection within the grounds, as crowds blocked roads in the area. International rights groups have criticised the response of security officials, with the United Nations calling for rights violations to be investigated. But the deputy Asia director of Human Rights Watch said authorities \"acted irresponsibly by treating the protests as acts of treason or terrorism\"."

Sir Keir Starmer announced in July that the UK would recognise a Palestinian state unless Israel meets certain conditions, those being: • Israel takes substantive steps to end the \"appalling situation in Gaza\" • Israel agrees to a ceasefire • Israel commits to a long-term sustainable peace - reviving the prospect of a two-state solution • Israel must allow the UN to restart the supply of aid • There must be no annexations in the West Bank  In response, the Israeli foreign ministry said: \"The shift in the British government's position at this time, following the French move and internal political pressures, constitutes a reward for Hamas and harms efforts to achieve a ceasefire in Gaza and a framework for the release of hostages.\" The UN General Assembly session in New York will begin on 9 September. Ireland, Spain, and Norway all officially recognised a Palestinian state last year. Out of the 193 United Nations member states, 147 already recognise Palestine as a state as of March 2025. Earlier this month, Israeli minister Bezalel Smotrich announced plans to build a new settlement in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, which he said would \"bury\" the idea of a Palestinian state.  It comes after US secretary of state Marco Rubio revoked the visas of 81 delegates from the Palestinian Authority (PA) and Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO) - blocking them from attending the general assembly. Under a 1947 UN agreement, the US is generally required to allow access for foreign diplomats to the UN in New York. But Washington has said it can deny visas for security, extremism and foreign policy reasons.

        "Content": "By Gemma Peplow, culture and entertainment reporter, and Katie Spencer, entertainment correspondent  Before he died alone in his jacuzzi, Matthew Perry had received three injections of ketamine in the space of just six hours. \"Shoot me up with a big one,\" he told his personal assistant, ahead of the final, fatal dose. According to court documents, in the period leading up to 28 October 2023, Kenneth Iwamasa was illegally administering Perry with between six and eight shots of the drug, an anaesthetic that can have hallucinogenic effects, each day. A live-in assistant, he admitted to finding the actor unconscious at his Pacific Palisades home on at least two occasions in the weeks prior. The hit that ultimately killed the Friends star was supplied by Jasveen Sangha, also known as the \"Ketamine Queen\" - a dealer who apparently only dealt \"with high-end and celebs\". She has agreed to plead guilty to five charges and will appear in court later today. Her charges, along with others filed against Iwamasa and others over the supply of ketamine to Perry, exposed part of Hollywood's underground drug network - and put the spotlight on the world of celebrity, money and power. 'Yes men' with terrible consequences Perry's death was met with both utter shock and a sad sense of the inevitable. The world knew him best as Chandler Bing, the comic heartbeat of Friends. But behind the jokes and the sarcasm, he was deeply troubled. \"It almost felt like we'd been mourning Matthew for a long time because his battle with that disease was a really hard one for him to fight,\" is how his former co-star Jennifer Aniston described his addiction in a recent interview. \"As hard as it was for all of us and for the fans, there's a part of me that thinks this is better... I'm glad he's out of that pain.\" The actor was an addict, and vulnerable - but also a huge star, worth millions. Iwamasa was administering the injections, ultimately playing God - but to him, the power most likely lay with his famous boss. His actions may seem inexcusable, but did he feel he had a choice? \"I think it was a situation that increasingly got more and more out of control,\" says Bonnie Low-Kramen, a former celebrity assistant turned trainer, and author of Be The Ultimate Assistant. Those who do the job, especially in Los Angeles, can be put under an enormous amount of pressure, she says, \"tasked with doing things many of us wouldn't imagine carrying out for our employers. It is a job which comes with an inherent power imbalance\". Which means it can be incredibly hard to say no. \"When people are rich and famous, they often have people around them who won't say no,\" she says. \"And assistants are in the yes business anyway. \"We're in the business of figuring out, 'well, let's solve the problem...'. When money is no object, there are new rules that apply in that situation and that can be really hard to handle.\" Iwamasa is not the first celebrity assistant asked to administer or pick up illegal drugs, she says, and Perry is not the first star to die after taking drugs. Ms Low-Kramen highlights the deaths of Janis Joplin, Prince and John Belushi as just a few other examples. \"Unfortunately, there are so many examples of this tragic end, where the abuse of drugs gets to a point where they've handled it for a really long time, and then the day comes when it can't be handled anymore.\" For those struggling with addiction, being surrounded by \"yes men\" can have terrible consequences, says Garrett Braukman, an addiction treatment executive in Hollywood. \"Treatment is difficult for people when they have yes men. They have a lot of people that are going to tell them you can get whatever you want, you can get drugs, you can get alcohol, you could do whatever, and no one is willing to really look at that from the perspective of how dangerous that is.\" Read more:Obituary: The one who made everyone laughMatthew Perry: A life in pictures Mr Braukman says addiction can go hand in hand with fame and that a \"high\" percentage of his patients work in the entertainment industry. \"I don't know how I would be able to stay clean and sober if I go to my grandma's house and there's 20 guys outside of my grandma's house taking pictures of me walking in. You become an animal to a degree that people are watching.\" Rise in use of ketamine The use of ketamine recreationally has been on the rise in recent years, in the UK as well as the US. In England, some 3,609 people started treatment for problems with the drug in the year 2023-2024 - more than eight times the number in 2014-2015, when 426 sought help, according to government statistics. In January, drag queen The Vivienne was found dead in the bath at their home in Cheshire, aged 32. The star's family later told how the performer had died \"from the effects of ketamine use causing a cardiac arrest\". Ketamine is usually taken recreationally as a crushed powder, but also sometimes injected or swallowed - making people feel detached and dreamlike. It can also cause severe bladder and kidney problems. Perry's struggles with alcohol and other drugs, before ketamine, were long running and well documented, starting with drinking as a teenager before moving on to painkilling prescription drugs Vicodin and OxyContin, and tranquilliser Xanax. \"I have spent upward of $7m (£5.8m) trying to get sober,\" he wrote in his memoir, released when he was clean, just a year before his death. While accepting the almost unsurpassable legacy of the hit show that made him a star, he said he hoped his support for fellow addicts would be the achievement he was best remembered for. \"When I die, I don't want Friends to be the first thing that's mentioned - I want helping others to be the first thing that's mentioned and I'm going to live the rest of my life proving that.\" He only lived for another year. Illegal use v therapy Before he died, Perry had been undergoing legal ketamine infusion therapy to treat depression and anxiety. The drug can be used as a treatment in clinical settings in the US, and some specialist and private centres in the UK - although there are concerns from some medics here about its use even in those settings. According to a postmortem report, the actor had reportedly been clean for 19 months before he started obtaining the drug illegally as well. It was not the supervised doses that killed him, but the idea of an addict taking the drug to help their problems might still sound shocking. In California, ketamine drips are legally used as pain relief, to treat mood disorders and to help with addiction. Other celebrities and notable figures - including Chrissy Teigen, Elon Musk and Sharon Osbourne - have all shared details of ketamine therapy and how it helped them. Dr Austin Harris, owner and medical director at NeuroRelief Ketamine Infusion Therapy, says historically the drug is \"extremely safe\" when used in the right conditions, and swears by its effectiveness. At the clinic in California, he explained to Sky News how it can help people with mood disorders and chronic pain, as well as those in recovery from drug or alcohol abuse. \"Which a lot of people who don't really understand this at a scientific level might think is an oxymoron,\" he says. \"But actually, it's profoundly beneficial - done properly - in resetting both neurologic and psychological patterns for substance abuse.\" Ketamine infusion \"restarts in our brain what should already be there\", he says, in terms of \"the neurologic road workers, to be able to then direct, to build new patterns and actual new nerve pathways\". One patient having therapy at the clinic also spoke to us, saying he had abused alcohol and marijuana, and occasionally opiate painkillers, for many years. \"I've had enough experience and decades of being addicted to drugs and alcohol and traumas and trying different things,\" he said. \"When I came out of that infusion I was like, wait a minute. I didn't have the shakes. I didn't have the cravings.\" Read more:Parties and busted doors: Living next to 'Ketamine Queen'The drug addiction leaving users in chronic pain Dr Harris emphasises the need for administration by a professional in a clinical setting. \"Matthew Perry was being illegally sold ketamine on the black market. The fact that a doctor happened to be one of several people that was illegally selling it to him should not be confused with the appropriate legal utilisation of ketamine.\" The actor was vulnerable, Dr Harris continues. \"It's absolutely abominable... You have someone with serious addiction problems, lifelong. And sadly, I think that he was really taken advantage of.\" The drugs stash  As well as Sangha and Iwamasa, the others charged over Perry's death are Erik Fleming, an associate of Perry's who was in contact with Sangha, Dr Mark Chavez, a physician, and Dr Salvador Plasencia, who also supplied ketamine illegally to Perry. \"I wonder how much this moron will pay,\" Dr Plasencia said in a text exchange between him and Chavez. After Perry died, Sangha desperately sought to cover her involvement. \"Delete all our messages,\" she instructed Fleming in a message on Signal. In March 2024, law enforcement searched Sangha's home and found 1.7kg of pressed pills containing methamphetamine, 79 vials of liquid ketamine, MDMA (ecstasy) tablets, counterfeit Xanax pills, baggies containing powdered ketamine and cocaine, and other drug-trafficking items such as a gold money counting machine, a scale, a wireless signal and hidden camera detector, drug packaging materials, and $5,723 in cash, according to her plea agreement. Sangha was happy to supply to Hollywood's rich and famous - and not an anomaly. Several books have been written by Tinseltown dealers, and only a few months ago, the Sean \"Diddy\" Combs trial heard from a former personal assistant to the hip-hop mogul who testified about meeting sellers for his boss. Now, as she becomes the last defendant to admit her role in Perry's death, the Ketamine Queen's guilty plea brings to a close the criminal investigation into the circumstances surrounding the tragedy. But in a world where money talks, where fame and addiction or mental health issues often go hand-in-hand, it is unlikely to be the last."

Cardi then told the court she heard Ms Ellis say her name into a phone and appeared to be filming her, fearing Ms Ellis would out the fact that she was pregnant. \"I told her, 'Why are you recording?'\" she testified, \"and she said, 'Oh my bad.'

        "Content": "\n          Business and economics reporter\n              @SkyNewsBiz\n The group of Thames Water lenders aiming to rescue the company have set out plans for £20.5bn of investment to bolster performance. The proposals, submitted to the regulator for consideration, include commitments to spending £9.4bn on sewage and water assets over the next five years, up 45% on current levels, to prevent spills and leaks respectively. Of this, £3.9bn would go towards the worst performing sewage treatment sites following a series of fines against Thames Water, and other major operators, over substandard storm overflow systems. It said this would be achieved at the 2025-30 bill levels already in place, so no further increases would be needed, but it continued to argue that leniency over poor performance will be needed to effect the turnaround. The creditors have named their consortium London & Valley Water. It effectively already owns Thames Water under the terms of a financial restructuring agreed early in the summer but Ofwat is yet to give its verdict on whether the consortium can run the company, averting the prospect of it being placed in a special administration regime.  Thames is on the brink of nationalisation because of the scale of its financial troubles, with debts above £17bn. Without a deal the consortium, which includes investment heavyweights Elliott Management and BlackRock, would be wiped out. Ofwat, which is to be scrapped under a shake-up of oversight, is looking at the operational plan separately to its proposed capital structure. The latter is expected to be revealed later this month. Sky News revealed on Monday that the consortium was to offer an additional £1bn-plus sweetener in a bid to persuade Ofwat and the government to back the rescue.  Mike McTighe, the chairman designate of London & Valley Water, said: \"Over the next 10 years the investment we will channel into Thames Water's network will make it one of the biggest infrastructure projects in the country. \"Our core focus will be on improving performance for customers, maintaining the highest standards of drinking water, reducing pollution and overcoming the many other challenges Thames Water faces. \"This turnaround has the opportunity to transform essential services for 16 million customers, clean up our waterways and rebuild public trust.\" Read more from Sky News:Value of pound sinksUK hit by toxic cocktail of market shifts The government has clearly signalled its preference that a market-based solution is secured for Thames Water, though it has lined up a restructuring firm to advise on planning in the event the proposed rescue deal fails. A major challenge for the consortium is convincing officials that it has the experience and people behind it to meet the demands of running a water company of Thames Water's size, serving about a quarter of the country's population."

        "Content": "\n          Economics and data editor\n              @EdConwaySky\n  No chancellor much likes it when the pound takes a tumble. No chancellor much likes it when the yield on their government debt - the interest rate paid by the state - climbs to historic highs. When these two things happen on the same day, and in the run-up to a hotly-awaited Budget… well, that's the last thing any chancellor ever wants to see coming up on their screen. Yet that was the toxic cocktail that awaited Rachel Reeves on the terminal screens in the Treasury on Tuesday morning. The pound dropped by more than a percent against the US dollar, while the yield on 30-year government debt (known as gilts) rose to the highest level since 1998. The real question now is: how much does she have to worry about it and, more to the point, what can she do about it? Let's start with the first question first. Bond yields are a measure of the interest rate paid on debt and, in the case of government debt, they are influenced by all sorts of things. This makes interpreting their movements quite tricky, at the best of times. For in one respect, they are a proxy for how creditworthy (or not) investors think a government is. If they think a country is about to default on its debt (Greek bonds and the euro crisis are perhaps the best example) then they might sell a country's bonds and, lo and behold, the interest rate on those bonds goes up.  But in another respect they also reflect what people think will happen to inflation and interest rates in the coming years (or, in the case of long-dated bonds like the 30-year gilt, the coming decades). So, if you think inflation is going to be higher for longer, then all else equal, you would expect gilt yields to be higher, since that implies the Bank of England will have to keep its interest rates higher. It all feeds into the government bond yield. \n                  Bank shares take fright as budget tax hike is floated\n                 \n                  Surprise good news as government borrowing less than forecast\n                 \n                  Something for everyone in UK's latest GDP data\n                 Nor is that the end of it, because these yields are also affected by all sorts of other things: how much demand is there from pension funds? What's the impact of the ageing population? How fast is the country going to grow? All of these things (and more) can have a bearing on the bond yield. Money latest: Hopes for interest rate cut suffer blow All of which is to say, there's rarely a single explanation for phenomena like the one we've got today. Consider the higher 30-year bond yields faced by the UK. On the one hand, there's a compelling explanation served up by the Whitehall and parliamentary drama of recent months. The government has failed to pass some key legislation cutting welfare spending. It has also had to do a U-turn on cutting winter fuel payments. Those two decisions mean it is left with a sizeable hole in the public finances in the coming years. That in turn makes it considerably more likely that it might have to borrow more, which in turn means investors might be getting more worried about Britain's indebtedness. That's totally consistent with higher gilt yields. And so perhaps it's no surprise that the UK's 30-year bond yield is considerably higher than other G7 nations.  But it's not quite that simple. For one thing, Britain is far from the only country in the G7 with a public finances problem. France and the US have deficit trajectories that look considerably less controlled than Britain's. Nor is it evident from other measures of fiscal concern - for instance, the credit default swaps insuring against a country going bust - that Britain is an outlier. Read more:Thames Water creditors offer £1bn 'sweetener'Empty flats that developers say sum up UK's housing crisis Now consider another datapoint: inflation. Britain has the highest inflation rate in the G7, by some margin. In other words, part of the explanation for the UK's high yields is that markets are fretting not just about fiscal policy (the stuff done in Whitehall) but monetary policy (the stuff done by the Bank of England in the city). Now, in practice these two worlds bleed into each other. Part (though certainly not all) of the reason inflation is high is those National Insurance hikes introduced by the Labour government. In short, this is a bit more complicated than some of the more breathless commentary in recent weeks might have you believe. Even so, regardless of how you balance those explanations, there is no doubting that Britain finds itself in a tricky position. This combination - of high inflation, weak economic growth and a large and swelling budget deficit - is precisely the economic cocktail that landed the Labour government of the mid-1970s with an IMF bailout. We are a long, long way from anything like that happening this time around. But the ingredients are familiar enough that no one should be altogether complacent. After all, the last time a government got overly complacent about these factors, back in 2022, we all know what happened next. The mini-Budget, a vertiginous spike in bond yields and a period where Britain's financial markets stared into the precipice. Best not to repeat that again."

        "Content": "\n          Business and economics reporter\n              @taaffems\n  The value of the pound has sunk - as the cost of 30-year government borrowing reached a high last seen in 1998. The so-called spot rate saw one pound buy $1.336 on Tuesday, a low last seen in early August, and down from $1.353 earlier in the day. Despite the dip, it's still higher than the vast majority of the past year: in early September 2024, a pound bought $1.31. Money blog: 'She didn't get me a wedding gift - even though I spent thousands on her' The decline, however, means sterling is on course for the biggest one-day drop since April, when Donald Trump's announcement of country-specific tariffs spooked markets. The drop was similarly steep against the euro, with a pound momentarily buying €1.1486, a low not seen since November 2023, nearly two years ago. It's also a fall from €1.1586 earlier in the trading session. Before the so-called liberation day announcement, £1 equalled nearly €1.19. It comes as the yield - the interest rate demanded by investors - on 30-year government bonds - loans taken by the state - hit 5.72%, the highest rate this century. Why? Yields are rising across the globe in the face of weak economic growth and the US trade war. Investors are also concerned about UK government finances as Chancellor Rachel Reeves battles to stick to her fiscal rules to bring down debt and balance the budget. High inflation and increased public debt from the pandemic have left a deficit between state spending and income. There have been high-profile government U-turns on winter fuel payments and welfare spending cuts that have meant the chancellor has to look elsewhere to meet her self-imposed fiscal rules. Read more:Thames Water creditors offer £1bn 'sweetener'Empty flats that developers say sum up UK's housing crisis More expensive interest payments from rising bond yields have meant the country is stuck in a cycle of rising debt. Today's rises to the cost of government borrowing could not have come at a worse time for the public finances. While a £14bn sale of new 10-year government debt - a record sum - was completed, it was achieved at the highest yield since 2008. Lale Akoner, global market analyst at investment platform eToro, said of the auction: \"For the government, this creates a paradox - market confidence in UK debt is robust, but financing that debt is increasingly expensive, constraining budget flexibility and raising the stakes for fiscal discipline ahead of the autumn budget.\" The yield on 10-year gilts, as they are known in the UK, later rose to its highest since January at 4.825%, up on the day but in line with their transatlantic equivalent, US Treasuries. The global bond sell-off was also being reflected on stock markets. The Dow Jones Industrial Average and tech-focused Nasdaq were both down by more than 1% at the open on Wall St. In Europe, Germany's DAX closed more than 2% lower while the FTSE 100 was almost 0.9% down - shielded to some degree by the weaker pound. The more domestically-focused FTSE 150, however, was down by more than 2%. The flight from risk also saw the spot price of gold, traditionally a safe haven for investors in times of uncertainty, briefly climb to a new record high of $3,578.40 per ounce."

        "Content": "\n          Business and economics correspondent\n              @pkelso\n Kemi Badenoch's promise to \"maximise\" oil and gas extraction has put clear North Sea water between her party and the government. Given the scant reserves that remain beneath the UK continental shelf however, the plan may be literally scraping the barrel. In the first concrete policy consequence of Ms Badenoch's declaration that net zero (a policy introduced by her predecessor Theresa May) is \"impossible\", she says the current ban on new oil and gas licences will be scrapped in the event she wins power. Money latest: Hopes for interest rate cut suffer blow Echoing Donald Trump's faith in fossil fuels, she told a conference in Aberdeen that North Sea oil and gas will be the \"cornerstone of Britain's future\". Given the long-term decline of reserves, that may be a stretch, even by the Conservatives' numbers. Shadow energy secretary Claire Coutinho says maximising extraction could generate £12bn in tax revenues over the course of this Parliament but she concedes it would not bring down prices for billpayers determined on global markets. And while the oil and gas sector would jump at the chance to explore the potential of new reserves, the data suggests it could be a case of 'drill, maybe, drill'. \n                  Thames Water rescue plan promises £20.5bn investment\n                 \n                  No room for Treasury complacency as UK hit by toxic cocktail of market shifts\n                 \n                  Pound drops as 30-year gilt yields at highest level this century\n                  North Sea oil and gas was the UK's greatest windfall of the last century but production of oil and gas peaked in the late 1990s and, after a few years when we were net exporters, has been in steep decline since. The reserves are far from empty but they are much reduced and cover only around 50% of domestic demand. The impact of tapping undeveloped and undiscovered fields meanwhile is marginal. 👉 Listen to Sky News Daily on your podcast app 👈 Regulator the North Sea Transition Authority estimates an annual decline in extraction of around 10% and says around 3.75 billion barrels of oil equivalents (BOE) of oil and gas remain untapped. That's a relative drop in the ocean of fuel extracted since the 1970s and would add only a few thousand BOE to the more than one million extracted every day last year. The oil extracted is also harder and therefore more expensive to extract and of lower quality, which explains why many of the oil majors have already left the North Sea fields to more speculative players. None of which is an argument against further extraction as long as you are willing to accept the cost and the consequences.  Energy Secretary Ed Miliband's primary motivation for the ban on new licences was to cut emissions, but here the same arguments apply. A marginal amount of extra oil and gas can only contribute marginal extra emissions, which would in any event be lower than from imported fuels we are going to need anyway. A more balanced policy, as championed by the governments of David Cameron, Liz Truss and Rishi Sunak, as well as Boris Johnson and Theresa May, was to transition away from fossil fuels while allowing North Sea reserves to be explored down as long as is profitable. Ms Badenoch is right that the North Sea will be the cornerstone of the UK's energy future, but what happens above the surface will be more consequential than what lies beneath. Wind power is already the engine room of the grid, providing 30% of the UK's electricity last year, but accessing that capacity at a pace and price we can afford is the key question facing politicians on all sides. Until now the energy transition has been relatively painless but the bill, for building and maintaining new renewable generation and a grid that can handle it, while adding nuclear facilities and keeping a gas network on standby, is about to land."

        "Content": "\n          City editor\n              @MarkKleinmanSky\n The owner of the Cote restaurant chain is exploring the option of injecting new funding into the business and retaining control after two months of talks with potential buyers. Sky News has learnt that Partners Group, the Swiss-based private equity firm, is seriously considering providing millions of pounds of new capital to finance a turnaround plan which would be likely to involve the closure of loss-making sites. Partners Group hired Interpath Advisory during the summer to sound out prospective bidders. A number of those discussions are said to be ongoing. Cote was bought out of administration by Partners Group in the autumn of 2020 in a deal reportedly worth £55m. The chain trades from about 70 restaurants, down from close to 100 shortly before it collapsed into insolvency five years ago. Sources close to the sale process said that Interpath had been marketing the company based on last year's turnover of over £150m. Roughly 60 of the sites are said to be profitable, implying there could be scope for further closures. The sale process comes at a time when hospitality venue operators continue to face severe financial pressures, with the industry's leading trade body recently warning of a further jobs bloodbath in the months ahead. \"If we carry on with these trends and the situation doesn't improve - and clearly Rachel Reeves's statements are giving a signal to consumers that it is not going to get better any time soon - then I would see this accelerating,\" said Kate Nicholls, chair of UK Hospitality. \"Unless there is a change of tack by the government, we are looking at 150,000-200,000 fewer workers in hospitality during the first full year of [employer national insurance contribution] changes.\" Partners Group and Interpath declined to comment."

There have been suggestions that the Greens could join forces with Mr Corbyn's new party - which does not yet have a formal name - to avoid splitting the vote on the left. Politics latest: Reeves' authority not dented by reshuffle, No 10 says  The question of a future potential pact with Mr Corbyn and his co-leader, the independent MP Zarah Sultana, became an issue in the Green Party's leadership election, with Mr Polanski more keen on the idea than his co-leadership rivals. Mr Polanski, who secured 20,411 votes - comfortably beating the 3,705 votes cast for the joint leadership bid of Mr Ramsay and Dr Chowns - praised Mr Corbyn for holding his own inquiry into the government's conduct in Gaza, which will begin later this week. The former Labour leader had tabled a private members' bill calling for an independent public inquiry into the UK's involvement in Israeli military operations in Gaza, but it did not progress in the House of Commons. \n                  The 'eco-populist' Green Party leader who wants to be the Farage of the Left \n                 \n                  Who is Zack Polanski?

My Corbyn congratulated Mr Polanski for his \"stunning victory\" after the results were announced, and added: \"Your campaign took on the rich and powerful, stood up for the dignity of all marginalised communities, and gave people hope! Real change is coming. I look forward to working with you to create a fairer, kinder world.\" Mr Polanski, who is currently serving as deputy leader, won the election on a platform of \"eco-populism\", which he says will make the Greens a real alternative to Labour and Reform UK. The London Assembly member, who is not an MP, will now become the party's only leader, after Bristol MP Carla Denyer stepped down from her joint role with Mr Ramsay, triggering the contest. While Mr Polanski has strongly criticised the policies of Nigel Farage, he has acknowledged his cut-through with voters, and has argued that the Green Party needs to offer a bolder message to voters, in the guise of wealth taxes and net zero policies.  The new Green leader also weighed into the debate about flying the St George's Cross, after the prime minister Sir Keir Starmer said he had one in his office - while also cautioning against the flag being used as a political statement. Read more:Inside Jeremy Corbyn's new party and the battle for leadershipHundreds of empty flats sum up UK's housing crisis Asked what he thought of the St George's Cross, Mr Polanski said: \"I think that migration is at the heart of this country.

The 42-year-old, who stormed his party's leadership contest by a large margin, calls himself an \"eco-populist\" (he used to be involved in Extinction Rebellion), and thinks the Greens could learn a lot from the media-savvy tactics of Reform which have seen them surge ahead of Labour in the polls.

His two rivals in the leadership contest Adrian Ramsay, one of the party's current leaders, and Ellie Chowns, were elected last year, but are not well-known to the public.

Mr Polanski apologised and says he is focused on the future. His ambitions are high for the fifth party in British politics - currently polling at around 10%. \"Thirty to forty MPs at the next election\", he says. Enough to deny Labour a majority if it's close, or to be kingmakers. As politics fractures, he hopes they could have a big impact for the first time in decades. The Green Party in the UK - unlike its counterparts in other European countries - has struggled electorally until very recently. It was formed in a pub in Coventry in 1972 by activists inspired by the US environmentalist Paul Ehrlich, who warned that the world was overpopulated, spelling disaster for nature. Its biggest success was in the 1989 European elections, gaining 15% of the vote, but representation in parliament was not achieved until 2010 when Caroline Lucas took Brighton Pavilion from Labour. She became an influential campaigner on the climate, fracking and animal rights, also warning against economic growth at any cost. After she stood down, the party struggled to find its voice, with Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party pursuing a radical left-wing agenda. Now, after winning four MPs last year, Mr Polanski believes that with Labour in government and Reform at its coat tails, their moment has come. Read more:Inside Jeremy Corbyn's new party and the battle for leadershipHundreds of empty flats sum up UK's housing crisis He told members: \"We can, and we will lower your bills.

We are not here to be concerned by you. We're here to replace you.\" Mr Polanski is unashamedly pro-migration and trans rights. He's also suggested Britain should leave NATO. He'd consider working with the incipient party being set up by Mr Corbyn and former Labour MP Zarah Sultana, with the support of some of the pro-Gaza independents. All of that may not endear him to all the Green Party's potential supporters. The party now has 860 councillors, but some are in rural areas where they've won seats from the Tories. There is a political opportunity on the left. Mr Polanski says he knows what will get his party into the spotlight. But it's a far bigger task to deliver seats in parliament - including one he'll need for himself."

The government has announced a new legal requirement for Sentencing Council guidelines to be agreed by the Justice Secretary before they are issued to courts in England and Wales. Politics latest: Home secretary refuses to guarantee start of migrant returns deal  The Sentencing Council is an independent, non-departmental public body made up of senior legal figures that issues guidelines to courts in England and Wales. It was at the centre of the row earlier this year after advising judges to factor in the backgrounds of offenders as part of the sentencing process. The proposed guidelines said courts should \"normally consider\" ordering a pre-sentence report (PSR) for criminals if they were from an ethnic, cultural minority or faith minority community, transgender, under the age of 25, pregnant or female. PSRs are taken into account when considering a criminal's sentence. \n                  Politics latest: Waving the St George's Cross flag could be seen as 'intimidating', new Greens leader says\n                 \n                  New Green leader reveals he spoke to Jeremy Corbyn - and doesn't rule out pact\n                 \n                  The 'eco-populist' Green Party leader who wants to be the Farage of the Left \n                 The council said at the time that the recommendation was aimed at reflecting disparities in sentencing outcomes. According to the most recent government statistics, since 2018 white defendants are more likely to have a shorter jail sentence than any other ethnic group. However, the Tories called it an example of \"two-tier\" justice, arguing it was biased against Christians and straight white men. Justice Secretary Shabana Mahmood also expressed her \"displeasure\" at the body's recommendations, arguing that \"as someone who is from an ethnic minority background myself, I do not stand for any differential treatment before the law\".  The council rejected her calls for a re-think but abandoned the guidelines after ministers threatened emergency legislation to override it. The new law means the Sentencing Council will be unable to issue new guidelines without the explicit approval of the justice secretary or the lady chief justice, who is head of the judiciary. If either one of them opposes the guidance, it will not be issued. Read More:Starmer to hold first cabinet meeting since No 10 shakeupWho are the Green Party's leadership hopefuls?

It is right that we now have greater democratic and judicial oversight of the direction of the Council's work and the final guidelines they publish.\" The Sentencing Council declined to comment to Sky News. The changes will be brought in as part of the Sentencing Bill, which is being introduced in the House of Commons on Tuesday. The legislation also contains plans aimed at tackling prison overcrowding, including what the Ministry of Justice has dubbed as \"Texas-style earned release sentences\" - where prisoners are freed earlier based on good behaviour. The changes will also abolish most short-term prison sentences and toughen up community punishments."

After a summer of unrest over asylum hotels, speculation about tax rises in the autumn budget, and record low polling numbers, the prime minister will head up talks with Chancellor Rachel Reeves, Deputy PM Angela Rayner and other senior ministers. Politics Hub: Follow live updates It follows a shake-up of Sir Keir's Downing Street team, headlined by Labour MP Darren Jones moved from the Treasury to Number 10 to oversee the day-to-day delivery of the prime minister's priorities. He spent the last year as the chief secretary to the Treasury - essentially Ms Reeves's deputy. That role will now be taken by James Murray, who was previously the exchequer secretary.

Speaking to BBC Radio 5 Live, he said he understood the public's \"frustration\" - but insisted the first year of his government had been about \"fixing the foundations\". He said it will now go \"further and faster\" to deliver change. Reports suggest the shake-up has been done with an eye on the autumn budget. Last year's, the first by a Labour chancellor for well over a decade, was met with significant backlash - notably over the increase in national insurance contributions for employers. Ms Reeves had already been criticised for her controversial decision to cut the winter fuel allowance for millions of pensioners, which was later reversed. One source told The i there had been frustration over Ms Reeves's performance, saying she \"made mistakes and Keir got blamed\", while a Labour MP told The Daily Telegraph the PM's appointments were \"a signal that [Ms Reeves] is in a weak position, and it's deteriorating\".

The Sentencing Council said in April that a pre-sentence report, the results of which are taken into account when considering a criminal's sentence, would \"usually be necessary\" before handing out punishment for someone from an ethnic, cultural or faith minority. Ms Mahmood called the guidance \"unacceptable\" and said it amounted to \"differential treatment before the law\" as she urged the council to reverse it. Under new rules announced on Tuesday, the Sentencing Council will now be unable to issue any changes without ministerial oversight, and both the justice secretary and the lady chief justice will need to give the green light. The changes will be brought in as part of the Sentencing Bill, introduced in the House of Commons on Tuesday."

        "Content": "\n          Political reporter\n              @WillCharley1\n Zack Polanski has been decisively elected leader of the Green Party, but who is he and what does he stand for? Despite previously serving as deputy leader of the party, Mr Polanski, 42, was seen throughout the campaign as an insurgent candidate, offering change for the Greens. By comparison, his leadership rivals Adrian Ramsay and Dr Ellie Chowns were seen as being the candidates of continuity, rather than change. Politics latest - follow live updates Mr Polanski, who is not an MP but is a member of the London Assembly, won 20,411 votes - compared to the 3,705 ballots cast for Mr Ramsay and Dr Chowns, who ran on a joint ticket. It means his vision of creating an \"eco-populist\" Green Party, with a more visible mass-membership movement, has been decisively endorsed by those who voted - albeit if this was only 37% of those eligible to cast a ballot. So, who is Zack Polanski? \n                  New Green leader reveals he spoke to Jeremy Corbyn - and doesn't rule out pact\n                 \n                  The 'eco-populist' Green Party leader who wants to be the Farage of the Left \n                 \n                  Zack Polanski elected new leader of the Green Party\n                 Born David Paulden, he changed his name when he turned 18 to his grandfather's original surname. He grew up in Salford, initially attending a grammar school on a scholarship before switching to a comprehensive college. Mr Polanski then attended university in Wales and later in the United States. The Green Party leader is gay and thanked his partner following his victory. He is also vegan and lives in Hackney, east London. His political career began not with the Green Party, but with the Liberal Democrats, which he joined first, standing for the party as a councillor in north London in 2015 and again for the Lib Dems as a London Assembly candidate in 2016.  But he switched allegiance the following year, joining the Greens and being elected a member of the London Assembly in 2021, after an unsuccessful attempt to be elected as an MP in 2019. Mr Polanski was then elected deputy leader of the Green Party in 2022. While deputy leader, he was also re-elected back to the London Assembly in 2024 and became chair of the London Assembly environment committee. But Mr Polanski's rise to the top of the Greens is not without controversy. In 2013, he ran a hypnotherapy practice and served a Sun journalist who went in as a client, asking him whether he could make her think herself to having bigger boobs. Mr Polanski has since apologised for his past actions, telling LBC last year that it \"does not represent my work, it does not represent me\". He announced he would run to be leader of the Green Party in the 2025 contest, which was delayed by a year so as not to clash with the 2024 general election. Members of the party are asked to vote on the leaders every two years. What does he stand for? Mr Polanski pledged to bring about an \"eco-populist\" vision if elected, transforming the party into a more visible, mass-membership movement. He said people cannot focus on the climate crisis if they are facing challenging economic concerns, so he has advocated for high taxes on billionaires - including a wealth tax - as well as the renationalisation of water companies and more regulation for businesses. At a hustings in July, he argued that the party should combine \"substance with clickbait\" to bring a serious challenge to Reform UK. He has outlined a vision for the Greens to appeal to progressive left voters who feel that Labour has turned away from them under Sir Keir Starmer's leadership. Unlike his leadership rivals, Mr Polanski has also refused to rule out working with the new political party founded by former Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn and ex-Labour MP Zarah Sultana. Speaking following his election, Mr Polanski promised to \"work every single day to deliver environmental, social, racial and economic justice\". He also pledged to grow the party, saying he would like the Greens to win at least 30 seats at the next general election, as well as get more MSs elected to the Senedd in Cardiff. Mr Polanski hit out at \"charlatans like Nigel Farage\", accusing him and other millionaires of \"pretending to serve working-class communities\" while \"destroying our democracies\". But he also warned the Labour Party that the Greens are \"here to replace you\"."

        "Content": "By Gemma Peplow, culture and entertainment reporter, and Katie Spencer, entertainment correspondent  Before he died alone in his jacuzzi, Matthew Perry had received three injections of ketamine in the space of just six hours. \"Shoot me up with a big one,\" he told his personal assistant, ahead of the final, fatal dose. According to court documents, in the period leading up to 28 October 2023, Kenneth Iwamasa was illegally administering Perry with between six and eight shots of the drug, an anaesthetic that can have hallucinogenic effects, each day. A live-in assistant, he admitted to finding the actor unconscious at his Pacific Palisades home on at least two occasions in the weeks prior. The hit that ultimately killed the Friends star was supplied by Jasveen Sangha, also known as the \"Ketamine Queen\" - a dealer who apparently only dealt \"with high-end and celebs\". She has agreed to plead guilty to five charges and will appear in court later today. Her charges, along with others filed against Iwamasa and others over the supply of ketamine to Perry, exposed part of Hollywood's underground drug network - and put the spotlight on the world of celebrity, money and power. 'Yes men' with terrible consequences Perry's death was met with both utter shock and a sad sense of the inevitable. The world knew him best as Chandler Bing, the comic heartbeat of Friends. But behind the jokes and the sarcasm, he was deeply troubled. \"It almost felt like we'd been mourning Matthew for a long time because his battle with that disease was a really hard one for him to fight,\" is how his former co-star Jennifer Aniston described his addiction in a recent interview. \"As hard as it was for all of us and for the fans, there's a part of me that thinks this is better... I'm glad he's out of that pain.\" The actor was an addict, and vulnerable - but also a huge star, worth millions. Iwamasa was administering the injections, ultimately playing God - but to him, the power most likely lay with his famous boss. His actions may seem inexcusable, but did he feel he had a choice? \"I think it was a situation that increasingly got more and more out of control,\" says Bonnie Low-Kramen, a former celebrity assistant turned trainer, and author of Be The Ultimate Assistant. Those who do the job, especially in Los Angeles, can be put under an enormous amount of pressure, she says, \"tasked with doing things many of us wouldn't imagine carrying out for our employers. It is a job which comes with an inherent power imbalance\". Which means it can be incredibly hard to say no. \"When people are rich and famous, they often have people around them who won't say no,\" she says. \"And assistants are in the yes business anyway. \"We're in the business of figuring out, 'well, let's solve the problem...'. When money is no object, there are new rules that apply in that situation and that can be really hard to handle.\" Iwamasa is not the first celebrity assistant asked to administer or pick up illegal drugs, she says, and Perry is not the first star to die after taking drugs. Ms Low-Kramen highlights the deaths of Janis Joplin, Prince and John Belushi as just a few other examples. \"Unfortunately, there are so many examples of this tragic end, where the abuse of drugs gets to a point where they've handled it for a really long time, and then the day comes when it can't be handled anymore.\" For those struggling with addiction, being surrounded by \"yes men\" can have terrible consequences, says Garrett Braukman, an addiction treatment executive in Hollywood. \"Treatment is difficult for people when they have yes men. They have a lot of people that are going to tell them you can get whatever you want, you can get drugs, you can get alcohol, you could do whatever, and no one is willing to really look at that from the perspective of how dangerous that is.\" Read more:Obituary: The one who made everyone laughMatthew Perry: A life in pictures Mr Braukman says addiction can go hand in hand with fame and that a \"high\" percentage of his patients work in the entertainment industry. \"I don't know how I would be able to stay clean and sober if I go to my grandma's house and there's 20 guys outside of my grandma's house taking pictures of me walking in. You become an animal to a degree that people are watching.\" Rise in use of ketamine The use of ketamine recreationally has been on the rise in recent years, in the UK as well as the US. In England, some 3,609 people started treatment for problems with the drug in the year 2023-2024 - more than eight times the number in 2014-2015, when 426 sought help, according to government statistics. In January, drag queen The Vivienne was found dead in the bath at their home in Cheshire, aged 32. The star's family later told how the performer had died \"from the effects of ketamine use causing a cardiac arrest\". Ketamine is usually taken recreationally as a crushed powder, but also sometimes injected or swallowed - making people feel detached and dreamlike. It can also cause severe bladder and kidney problems. Perry's struggles with alcohol and other drugs, before ketamine, were long running and well documented, starting with drinking as a teenager before moving on to painkilling prescription drugs Vicodin and OxyContin, and tranquilliser Xanax. \"I have spent upward of $7m (£5.8m) trying to get sober,\" he wrote in his memoir, released when he was clean, just a year before his death. While accepting the almost unsurpassable legacy of the hit show that made him a star, he said he hoped his support for fellow addicts would be the achievement he was best remembered for. \"When I die, I don't want Friends to be the first thing that's mentioned - I want helping others to be the first thing that's mentioned and I'm going to live the rest of my life proving that.\" He only lived for another year. Illegal use v therapy Before he died, Perry had been undergoing legal ketamine infusion therapy to treat depression and anxiety. The drug can be used as a treatment in clinical settings in the US, and some specialist and private centres in the UK - although there are concerns from some medics here about its use even in those settings. According to a postmortem report, the actor had reportedly been clean for 19 months before he started obtaining the drug illegally as well. It was not the supervised doses that killed him, but the idea of an addict taking the drug to help their problems might still sound shocking. In California, ketamine drips are legally used as pain relief, to treat mood disorders and to help with addiction. Other celebrities and notable figures - including Chrissy Teigen, Elon Musk and Sharon Osbourne - have all shared details of ketamine therapy and how it helped them. Dr Austin Harris, owner and medical director at NeuroRelief Ketamine Infusion Therapy, says historically the drug is \"extremely safe\" when used in the right conditions, and swears by its effectiveness. At the clinic in California, he explained to Sky News how it can help people with mood disorders and chronic pain, as well as those in recovery from drug or alcohol abuse. \"Which a lot of people who don't really understand this at a scientific level might think is an oxymoron,\" he says. \"But actually, it's profoundly beneficial - done properly - in resetting both neurologic and psychological patterns for substance abuse.\" Ketamine infusion \"restarts in our brain what should already be there\", he says, in terms of \"the neurologic road workers, to be able to then direct, to build new patterns and actual new nerve pathways\". One patient having therapy at the clinic also spoke to us, saying he had abused alcohol and marijuana, and occasionally opiate painkillers, for many years. \"I've had enough experience and decades of being addicted to drugs and alcohol and traumas and trying different things,\" he said. \"When I came out of that infusion I was like, wait a minute. I didn't have the shakes. I didn't have the cravings.\" Read more:Parties and busted doors: Living next to 'Ketamine Queen'The drug addiction leaving users in chronic pain Dr Harris emphasises the need for administration by a professional in a clinical setting. \"Matthew Perry was being illegally sold ketamine on the black market. The fact that a doctor happened to be one of several people that was illegally selling it to him should not be confused with the appropriate legal utilisation of ketamine.\" The actor was vulnerable, Dr Harris continues. \"It's absolutely abominable... You have someone with serious addiction problems, lifelong. And sadly, I think that he was really taken advantage of.\" The drugs stash  As well as Sangha and Iwamasa, the others charged over Perry's death are Erik Fleming, an associate of Perry's who was in contact with Sangha, Dr Mark Chavez, a physician, and Dr Salvador Plasencia, who also supplied ketamine illegally to Perry. \"I wonder how much this moron will pay,\" Dr Plasencia said in a text exchange between him and Chavez. After Perry died, Sangha desperately sought to cover her involvement. \"Delete all our messages,\" she instructed Fleming in a message on Signal. In March 2024, law enforcement searched Sangha's home and found 1.7kg of pressed pills containing methamphetamine, 79 vials of liquid ketamine, MDMA (ecstasy) tablets, counterfeit Xanax pills, baggies containing powdered ketamine and cocaine, and other drug-trafficking items such as a gold money counting machine, a scale, a wireless signal and hidden camera detector, drug packaging materials, and $5,723 in cash, according to her plea agreement. Sangha was happy to supply to Hollywood's rich and famous - and not an anomaly. Several books have been written by Tinseltown dealers, and only a few months ago, the Sean \"Diddy\" Combs trial heard from a former personal assistant to the hip-hop mogul who testified about meeting sellers for his boss. Now, as she becomes the last defendant to admit her role in Perry's death, the Ketamine Queen's guilty plea brings to a close the criminal investigation into the circumstances surrounding the tragedy. But in a world where money talks, where fame and addiction or mental health issues often go hand-in-hand, it is unlikely to be the last."

She said she was four months into her pregnancy with the first of her three children with rapper Offset, and had not publicly shared news of her pregnancy After attending an appointment at the obstetrician's office - which had been closed to other patients on a Saturday for her privacy - she said Ms Ellis followed her to her fifth-floor appointment. Cardi then told the court she heard Ms Ellis say her name into a phone and appeared to be filming her, fearing Ms Ellis would out the fact that she was pregnant. \"I told her, 'Why are you recording?'\" she testified, \"and she said, 'Oh my bad.' She practically apologised.'\" As an argument broke out, Cardi said \"she's walking into me\" and testified that Ms Ellis was bigger than her, \"She is like, security-heavy,\" she added. \"She just looks a little, like she could protect the building.\" Read more from Sky News:Man who snatched cap from boy at US Open apologisesDead man found 'in a pool of blood' at Burning Man festival Ms Ellis testified earlier in the trial that the incident left her humiliated and traumatised, and the scar on her face required cosmetic surgery.

His agent Michael Greene (not a relation) said he loved everything the actor \"did for his people and for all the world\" in a statement sent to Sky News. \"He was a great man of morals, ethics and character and will be eternally missed...God bless his beautiful soul.\" Greene was a \"trailblazer\" who opened doors for indigenous actors in Hollywood, US entertainment outlet Deadline reported.

        "Content": "Father Ted co-creator Graham Linehan has said he was arrested at Heathrow Airport, over social media posts sharing his views on trans rights. Writing on Substack, the 57-year-old said that after flying into the UK from Arizona, he was detained by five armed officers and put in a cell before being questioned over posts published on X in April. During questioning, he said a nurse checked on him and found his blood pressure had reached \"stroke territory\", so he was taken to A&E. A Met Police spokeswoman confirmed an arrest was made at Heathrow on Monday but did not identify Linehan. In a statement, the force said: \"On Monday 1 September at 1pm officers arrested a man at Heathrow Airport after he arrived on an inbound American Airlines flight. \"The man in his 50s was arrested on suspicion of inciting violence. This is in relation to posts on X. \"After being taken to police custody, officers became concerned for his health and he was taken to hospital. His condition is neither life-threatening nor life-changing. \"He has now been bailed pending further investigation.\" The arrest was made by officers from the force's Aviation Unit, the Met spokeswoman said, adding that it is routine for officers policing airports to carry firearms. \"These were not drawn or used at any point during the arrest,\" she said. Conservative MP Nick Timothy shared a post from Linehan's account which the Irish comedy writer was reportedly arrested over. Mr Timothy wrote: \"If he's guilty, so am I for retweeting him. If you support him, retweet him too. \"We need to change the law - and the culture of the police and public sector.\""

        "Content": "French actor Gerard Depardieu has been summoned to face trial in Paris over allegations of rape and sexual assault against actress Charlotte Arnould. \"I feel relieved,\" Ms Arnould wrote on Instagram after receiving the judge's indictment order. \"The order restores a form of judicial truth. I think I'm having trouble realising how huge this is.\" Ms Arnould's lawyer, Carine Durrieu-Diebolt, told French outlet Franceinfo she was \"extremely satisfied\" and said the decision was a \"moment of judicial truth in this case\". In 2018, prosecutors in Paris opened a preliminary investigation after Ms Arnould accused Depardieu of raping her at his home. He has denied wrongdoing. \"The acts of rape and sexual assault have been acknowledged,\" Ms Arnould said. \"Now, we await the next steps.\" Last year, prosecutors submitted a request for the case to proceed to trial. Earlier this year, Depardieu was convicted of sexually assaulting two women on a film set and received an 18-month suspended prison sentence. The 76-year-old was convicted of groping a 34-year-old assistant and a 54-year-old woman responsible for decorating the set during the filming of Les Volets Verts (The Green Shutters) in 2021. The court ordered his name to be listed in the national sex offender database.

In 1991, he was nominated for an Oscar for his performance as the swordsman and poet Cyrano de Bergerac. In recent years, Depardieu has been accused of misconduct, either publicly or in formal complaints, by more than 20 women. So far, only the sexual assault case has proceeded to court, with other cases dropped over a lack of evidence or an expired statute of limitations."
