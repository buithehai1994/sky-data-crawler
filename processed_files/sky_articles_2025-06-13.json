        "Content": "\n          Business and economics correspondent\n              @gurpreetnarwan\n The Middle East is the world's foremost oil-producing region and a major centre for maritime trade. Its waterways are a critical thoroughfare for cargo ships transporting oil and container ships with goods and appliances on board. Flare-ups in the Middle East have a predictable impact on the oil price, causing it to spike as investors grow fearful about supply constraints because of possible blockages and attacks on these maritime routes. As a result, shipping insurance premiums also rise, which are ultimately passed on to the consumer. Brent crude, the international benchmark, was up 8%, at $75 (Â£55) a barrel. Follow live: Israel-Iran conflict latest  That has a feed-through across the economy because oil goes into the manufacturing process of many goods and services, whether that's plastic toys or air travel. According to the International Monetary Fund (IMF), inflation in advanced economies rises by about 0.4 percentage points for every 10% increase in oil prices. Some experts are still sanguine about the impact on trade, but the region is already dealing with challenges.

Houthi rebels, backed by Iran, have been attacking ships passing through the Red Sea to the Suez Canal - a major hub route for container shipping. \"This has forced many ships to go the long way around Africa on routes between Asia and Europe, which adds one to two weeks of travel time and around $1m in cost per journey,\" said Sarah Schiffling, an academic at the Hanken School of Economics.  \"Longer travel times also mean that global capacity is reduced as ships are tied up on a journey for longer and that all has ripple effects across global transport networks and supply chains.\" Iran has also repeatedly threatened to block the Strait of Hormuz, which connects the Persian Gulf and the Arabian Sea. ðŸ‘‰Listen to The World with Richard Engel and Yalda Hakim on your podcast appðŸ‘ˆ The strait handles a quarter of the world's oil trade, and analysts at Goldman Sachs predict blockades in the Strait of Hormuz could push prices above $100 (Â£74) per barrel. That being said, this would be an extreme step for Iran that would anger its major customer - China - as well as Qatar and the United Arab Emirates (UAE), two other major oil-producing states, who also rely on the strait."

        "Content": "By Daniel Dunford, Freya Gibson, Joely Santa Cruz and Adam Parker, Sky News data and forensics unit  There have now been five consecutive nights of ongoing violence and disorder on the streets of Northern Ireland, with Ballymena at the focus of the unrest following a serious sexual assault on a teenage girl in the town on 7 June. Two 14-year-old boys were arrested and charged after the incident, and police in Northern Ireland said the pair used a Romanian interpreter to plead not guilty in court. After that, calls for \"peaceful protest\" from the victim's father were amplified online. Those protests took on an anti-immigration angle and erupted into riots and clashes with police. Analysis of social media messaging has shown there were already rising tensions in the town before the latest incident, following a decade of rapid demographic change. Before the protests On 30 May, eight days before the 7 June incident in the Clonavon Terrace area that triggered this week's violence, police released a statement regarding a different sexual assault in Ballymena, this time of a 13-year-old girl. The offence was alleged to have taken place on a public footpath near the Ballykeel housing estates, during daylight hours on Saturday 24 May. Local media at the time reported the suspect as having \"dark-coloured skin, dark brown eyes, and speaking in a foreign language\". On 31 May, a far-right news aggregator on messaging platform Telegram was already sharing information related to this incident, saying \"Ballymena said to be at boiling point\". But the online chatter remained relatively contained until after the police announcement on the evening of Sunday 8 June, that they had arrested the two 14-year-olds charged with the Clonavon Terrace incident. Analysis of posts on X, formerly known as Twitter, shows that there were 114 mentions of Ballymena per day from 3-7 June. It was mentioned 142 times on 8 June, then surged up to 10,300 on 9 June and 78,300 the following day. The majority of posts originated outside of Northern Ireland. Rapid demographic change The descriptions of the alleged perpetrators of the two incidents have contributed to the anti-immigrant sentiment of the violence. Sky News has seen Union flags and signs saying \"British household\" or \"Locals live here\" left outside homes of people keen to avoid being targeted, and has also spoken to Bulgarian nationals in Ballymena who say that they are \"terrified\" and \"scared to get out of the house\". Speaking in the House of Commons, Jim Allister, MP for North Antrim, which includes Ballymena, said he was \"appalled\" by the violence. \"However\", he said, \"the government must be aware of underlying tensions produced by uncontrolled and often undocumented immigration. \"None of that excuses violence, but it is a matter of concern to many.\" Analysis of census data shows there has been rapid demographic change in the town since 2011. No other part of Northern Ireland has seen a bigger increase in people who don't speak English/Irish as a first language. At the time of the 2021 census, three in 10 residents of central Ballymena said their first language was something other than English or Irish. One in eight listed Romanian, with a similar number listing other Eastern European languages like Bulgarian, Polish and Slovak. That figure is almost seven times higher than the average across Northern Ireland, and amounts to a trebling over the course of the decade. Almost three-quarters of the total foreign-born population of central Ballymena arrived in the country since 2011. The average is significantly lower for Northern Ireland as a whole, and England and Wales, where the rate of change has been more gradual. Of 621 primary schools in Northern Ireland where data is available, Ballymena Primary and Harryville Primary, both in central Ballymena, had the 7th and 8th highest share of \"newcomer pupils\". \"Newcomer\" is the term used by the Northern Irish Department for Education to refer to pupils who don't have satisfactory language skills to participate fully in the school curriculum. How, and when, will the violence end?  Sky's Connor Gillies, who has been in Ballymena reporting on the violence and talking to locals for the past few days, said on Wednesday that \"the talk here is that this unrest is only just beginning,\" adding that \"it could go on for weeks\". Meanwhile, locals have expressed that they don't like the talk from police and politicians that taking to the streets following an alleged sex attack on a teenage girl equates to them being \"racist thugs\". Police have responded to rioters' petrol bombs and bricks with rubber bullets and water cannon onslaughts of their own. There have been tens of arrests, as well as injuries to more than 50 police officers since Monday evening. Violence and disorder in Ballymena raged across Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday, appearing to have largely abated in the town by Thursday. However, the unrest has spread to other areas including Larne, Coleraine, Portadown and Belfast. A senior police officer insisted to Sky News that he did have \"a grip\" on the unravelling situation when questioned by Sky News, but officers from Scotland, Wales and England have been sent to bolster the forces of their Northern Irish colleagues. Anti-migrant rhetoric  From 7-12 June, 39,000 Ballymena-related posts on X mentioned \"migrants\", with around 95% of them deemed to be negative by social media analysis tool Talkwalker. Well-known far-right activist Tommy Robinson, who thanked X-owner Elon Musk for his support when he was released from prison four months early on 27 May, was the most influential poster. His 14 X posts about Ballymena between 7-12 June reached an average of 1.3 million accounts each.

        "Content": " David Beckham has called it \"truly humbling\" and an \"emotional moment\" to be made a knight in the King's Birthday Honours. The former England captain receives the honour alongside The Who frontman Roger Daltrey and Oscar-winning actor Gary Oldman. Singer and actress Elaine Paige, novelist Pat Baker, and former defence secretary Penny Mordaunt have been awarded damehoods. Meanwhile, Strictly Come Dancing hosts Tess Daley and Claudia Winkleman, as well as darts stars Luke Littler and Luke Humphries, will all get MBEs. Beckham was made an OBE in 2003, but now finally becomes Sir David after being in the running for many years. He gets the honour for his services to sport and charity. Sir David was said to be close to a knighthood in 2014, but reportedly lost out after HM Customs and Revenue flagged his involvement in an alleged tax avoidance scheme. \"Growing up in east London with parents and grandparents who were so patriotic and proud to be British, I never could have imagined I would receive such a truly humbling honour,\" he told PA news agency. \"To have played for and captained my country was the greatest privilege of my career, and literally a boyhood dream come true,\" added the former Manchester United and Real Madrid star. Sir David, who recently turned 50, was seen chatting to the King the day before his honour was announced as part of his role as an ambassador for the monarch's foundation. He said he'd been fortunate to \"represent Britain around the world and work with incredible organisations that are supporting communities in need and inspiring the next generation\". Sir David added: \"I'm so lucky to be able to do the work that I do and I'm grateful to be recognised for work that gives me so much fulfilment. \"It will take a little while for the news to sink in but I'm immensely proud and it's such an emotional moment for me to share with my family.\" On the music front, The Who's singer got a knighthood at age 81. Sir Roger - known for hits such as My Generation and Pinball Wizard - led the Teenage Cancer Trust at Royal Albert Hall concert series for more than two decades. \"It's kind of weird, but I am deeply honoured to get this, especially for the charity for the Teenage Cancer Trust, and I accept it on their behalf really, because this honour is really for all unsung heroes,\" said Sir Roger. \"It's a dream come true for me, but it's especially a dream because the charity means so much.\" TV presenter Tess Daly called her MBE \"the greatest surprise of my life\". \"I don't think I've come back down to earth yet,\" she told PA. \"I didn't see it coming, and it almost didn't happen because the letter went to the wrong address. \"And thank goodness someone very kind found me. And so by the time I got it, I only had, I think it was two or three days left to accept it.\" Her co-star on Strictly, Claudia Winkleman, said she was \"incredibly grateful\" to be recognised. \"I will buy a hat and am taking my mum [to receive the honour]. I am ridiculously lucky and will celebrate with Tess by doing a paso doble,\" she said. West End legend Elaine Page - who has starred in shows such as Cats and Evita - was also honoured for services to music and charity. The singer said she was in \"shock\" at becoming a dame \"I've got all these different emotions coming at me all at once,\" said the 77-year-old. I'm proud and I feel grateful and I'm thrilled and surprised, and so it's been quite a lot to take in.\" Dame Elaine has roles at two charities - The Children's Trust and The Dan Maskell Tennis Trust, which supports disabled tennis players. She's also presented a BBC radio show for more than 20 years.

The oldest is 106-year-old William Irwin, founder of the Coleraine Winemakers Club, who gets a BEM (British Empire Medal) for services to the community. However, the top accolade has been awarded to sculptor Sir Antony Gormley, the man behind the Angel of the North, who is made Companion of Honour for services to art. There can only be 65 companions at any one time. Other notable names on the list include former defence secretary Penny Mordaunt - who famously had a prominent role holding a sword at the King's coronation - and is now a dame; and former EastEnders actress Anita Dobson, who gets an OBE."

They have gathered in the scorching summer heat outside the morgue in the Indian city of Ahmedabad, and crane their necks to get a glimpse of the next stretcher carrying a body bag to a waiting ambulance. The process for identifying bodies after Thursday's Air India plane crash is painstaking and some have been burnt beyond recognition.

The wait for Lila Behan is agonising. She wails and cries, longing to see her grandson Akash one last time. She tells Sky News that he was outside when the aircraft crashed into their quarters. There was fire all around, her daughter-in-law Sita ran towards the flames and got severely burned. She's fighting for her life in the hospital's intensive care unit. \"I can't even see my child's face now, they said he's so severely burnt. But I just want to see him for one last time,\" she says. Anand Thanki lost three members of his extended family, including an infant. All were British nationals from Wellingborough, Northamptonshire. His sister-in-law Raxa had travelled to India with her daughter-in-law Yasha and infant grandson Rudra for a religious ceremony. Raxa lost her husband to cancer two months ago, and this was a ritual she needed to perform. Anand tells Sky News: \"It's a big loss, but what can we do? We can only blame our fate, it's probably written for us. \"Worst was for my nephew who had dropped them at the airport, returned home and heard the news of the incident.\" India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi has visited the crash site and assessed the situation. He knows the city in Gujarat well, it's personal for him. He has been a legislator for over a decade and previously served as the chief minister of the state of Gujarat. At the crash site, he walked around debris and the block of flats which were in the flight path of the plane.

At the hospital, Mr Modi met British national Vishwash Kumar Ramesh - the only person to escape the aircraft. He spoke of his miraculous escape. The scale of the tragedy has been compounded by its location. The plane came down right in the heart of a built-up neighbourhood, with the front of the aircraft crashing into residential quarters for medical students. The wheels and tail of the plane are embedded in the top floor of one of the buildings, where many had gathered for lunch in a dining hall. Plates are still on tables - evidence that residents were eating when the aircraft tore through. There were at least 23 victims on the ground, including students, doctors and family members. Some are in a critical condition.  The cause of the crash remains unknown. Investigators will now begin the long and complex process of establishing what went wrong. But many families will grapple with the unimaginable loss after one of the worst disasters in India's aviation history."

There will also be a minute's silence at the event following Thursday's crash in the city of Ahmedabad, western India. Following the crash, which killed at least 241 people, the King asked for some amendments to be made to his traditional birthday parade on Saturday. A palace spokesperson said Charles wanted the alterations \"as a mark of respect for the lives lost, the families in mourning and all the communities affected by this awful tragedy\". The minute's silence will be held after the King inspects the guard on Horse Guards Parade. It will be signalled in the traditional way by a Last Post and Reveille. Charles and the senior royals riding in the ceremony will wear black armbands, as will postilions, coachmen and coachwomen from the Royal Mews. They will not be worn by family members who are wearing civilian clothes. The King said he and the Queen were \"desperately shocked by the terrible events in Ahmedabad\" after the crash on Thursday.  A statement from Buckingham Palace continued: \"Our special prayers and deepest possible sympathy are with the families and friends of all those affected by this appallingly tragic incident across so many nations, as they await news of their loved ones. \"I would like to pay a particular tribute to the heroic efforts of the emergency services and all those providing help and support at this most heartbreaking and traumatic time.\" Union flags have today been flown at half-mast on all royal residences and government buildings. Alterations have been made to the Trooping event before. In 2017, Queen Elizabeth requested a minute's silence to be held during the parade as a mark of respect to those who died in the Grenfell Tower fire three days earlier.

More than 1,000 soldiers and 200 horses from the Household Division will be involved in the spectacular display, with members of the Royal Family also taking part on horseback or travelling along the Mall in carriages. Last year, the King joined Camilla in a carriage, rather than riding, after being diagnosed with cancer months earlier in February. It's been reported he will do the same this year, but this has not been confirmed by the palace.

        "Content": " Iran claims it has shot down two Israeli jets and that its response to Friday night's attacks on nuclear and military infrastructure has begun. The reports emerged as smoke was seen rising from Tel Aviv as Iran launched missiles at the Israeli city. Air raid sirens had been heard across Tel Aviv and Jerusalem as the missiles neared Israel. Footage has shown Israel's Iron Dome air defence system - which uses radars to detect and intercept short-range rockets, missiles and drones - stopping Iranian missiles from striking the city. However, video also suggests some missiles made it through. According to Israeli medics, a total of 34 people were taken to hospital in the Tel Aviv metropolitan area.  In a statement at around 1:50am on Saturday local time (11:50pm on Friday UK time), the Israel Defense Forces said: \"In the past hour, dozens of missiles have been launched from Iran toward the State of Israel. Some of the missiles were intercepted. \"Search and Rescue forces are currently operating in a number of locations across the country in which reports of fallen projectiles were received.\" Meanwhile, the Iranian Army had earlier said in a statement that its \"defence forces successfully hit and destroyed two F-35 fighter jets belonging to the zionist entity, in addition to a large number of small drones\". \"The fate of the two fighter pilots remains unknown and is being investigated,\" the statement added. Follow live: Israel-Iran conflict updates The escalation in the region comes after Israel launched a huge attack on Iran on Friday, which it says was aimed at degrading the country's nuclear ambitions and weakening its military. Israel was able to target key facilities and kill top generals and scientists. It said it airstrikes were necessary before its adversary got any closer to building an atomic weapon. As Israel braced itself for a retaliation, the IRNA state news agency in Iran confirmed this evening that the country's response had begun. It came as a reporter with the Iranian Tasnim news agency said missiles had been fired from Shiraz and Isfahan in Iran towards Israel. Read more:How attacks could impact global economyWho are the nuclear scientists killed by Israel?Why did Israel attack Iran?What are Iran's military capabilities? Sky News correspondent Mark Stone, who used to be based in Jerusalem, has said Iran is trying to \"overwhelm the Iron Dome defence system, which has to be manually reloaded again and again\". He added: \"[The Iron Dome] can be overwhelmed. We saw a number of instances in the videos a moment ago where it was clearly overwhelmed and some of those ballistic missiles hit targets in Tel Aviv.\" Three American officials have told Sky's US partner network NBC News that the US military helped Israel down some Iranian missiles this evening. As the barrage of missiles was fired at Israel, Iran's supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei wrote on X: \"The Zionist regime (Israel) will not remain unscathed from the consequences of its crime. \"The Iranian nation must be guaranteed that our response will not be half-measured,\" he said, adding Iran will \"inflict heavy blows\" on Israel. Mr Khamenei also said that Israel has initiated a war and that Tehran will not allow it to conduct \"hit and run\" attacks without grave consequences.  It came before Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called on Iranians to stand up to the regime in Tehran and help Israel \"clear the path for you to achieve your freedom\". In a video released during Iran's missile attack on Israel, Mr Netanyahu said Israel had taken out a \"large portion\" of Iran's ballistic missile arsenal and its \"most significant enrichment facility\". \"More is on the way,\" he added. \"The regime does not know what hit them, or what will hit them. It has never been weaker. This is your opportunity to stand up and let your voices be heard.\" The Israeli military has told people they can now leave air raid shelters but must stay near them in case of further attacks. The Israel Defence Forces issued instructions earlier this evening telling residents to stay in shelters and minimise movement in open areas. UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer and US President Donald Trump have agreed the mounting conflict between Iran and Israel should be resolved by \"diplomacy and dialogue\".  The two leaders spoke on Friday evening, as western nations began a diplomatic flurry to calm the conflict between Israel and Iran. Sir Keir earlier urged Mr Netanyahu to de-escalate and work towards a \"diplomatic resolution\". Meanwhile, Mr Trump urged Iran to quickly reach an agreement on curbing its nuclear program as Israel vowed to continue its bombardment of the country. Mr Trump framed the volatile moment in the Middle East as a possible \"second chance\" for Iran's leadership to avoid further destruction \"before there is nothing left and save what was once known as the Iranian Empire.\" The US president had urged Mr Netanyahu not to attack Iran. The two leaders had what was described as a heated 40-minute exchange by telephone last Monday. Speaking just hours before the attack, Mr Trump said he feared such action would destroy US hopes of an agreement with Iran to curtail its nuclear programme."

James Sheen, 40, and Michael Jones, 39, were part of the gang who planned and carried out the burglary at the Oxfordshire stately home. Sheen, 40, a roofer who pleaded guilty to burglary, conspiracy and transferring criminal property, was sentenced at Oxford Crown Court to four years in prison.

        "Content": "By Daniel Dunford, Freya Gibson, Joely Santa Cruz and Adam Parker, Sky News data and forensics unit  There have now been five consecutive nights of ongoing violence and disorder on the streets of Northern Ireland, with Ballymena at the focus of the unrest following a serious sexual assault on a teenage girl in the town on 7 June. Two 14-year-old boys were arrested and charged after the incident, and police in Northern Ireland said the pair used a Romanian interpreter to plead not guilty in court. After that, calls for \"peaceful protest\" from the victim's father were amplified online. Those protests took on an anti-immigration angle and erupted into riots and clashes with police. Analysis of social media messaging has shown there were already rising tensions in the town before the latest incident, following a decade of rapid demographic change. Before the protests On 30 May, eight days before the 7 June incident in the Clonavon Terrace area that triggered this week's violence, police released a statement regarding a different sexual assault in Ballymena, this time of a 13-year-old girl. The offence was alleged to have taken place on a public footpath near the Ballykeel housing estates, during daylight hours on Saturday 24 May. Local media at the time reported the suspect as having \"dark-coloured skin, dark brown eyes, and speaking in a foreign language\". On 31 May, a far-right news aggregator on messaging platform Telegram was already sharing information related to this incident, saying \"Ballymena said to be at boiling point\". But the online chatter remained relatively contained until after the police announcement on the evening of Sunday 8 June, that they had arrested the two 14-year-olds charged with the Clonavon Terrace incident. Analysis of posts on X, formerly known as Twitter, shows that there were 114 mentions of Ballymena per day from 3-7 June. It was mentioned 142 times on 8 June, then surged up to 10,300 on 9 June and 78,300 the following day. The majority of posts originated outside of Northern Ireland. Rapid demographic change The descriptions of the alleged perpetrators of the two incidents have contributed to the anti-immigrant sentiment of the violence. Sky News has seen Union flags and signs saying \"British household\" or \"Locals live here\" left outside homes of people keen to avoid being targeted, and has also spoken to Bulgarian nationals in Ballymena who say that they are \"terrified\" and \"scared to get out of the house\". Speaking in the House of Commons, Jim Allister, MP for North Antrim, which includes Ballymena, said he was \"appalled\" by the violence. \"However\", he said, \"the government must be aware of underlying tensions produced by uncontrolled and often undocumented immigration. \"None of that excuses violence, but it is a matter of concern to many.\" Analysis of census data shows there has been rapid demographic change in the town since 2011. No other part of Northern Ireland has seen a bigger increase in people who don't speak English/Irish as a first language. At the time of the 2021 census, three in 10 residents of central Ballymena said their first language was something other than English or Irish. One in eight listed Romanian, with a similar number listing other Eastern European languages like Bulgarian, Polish and Slovak. That figure is almost seven times higher than the average across Northern Ireland, and amounts to a trebling over the course of the decade. Almost three-quarters of the total foreign-born population of central Ballymena arrived in the country since 2011. The average is significantly lower for Northern Ireland as a whole, and England and Wales, where the rate of change has been more gradual. Of 621 primary schools in Northern Ireland where data is available, Ballymena Primary and Harryville Primary, both in central Ballymena, had the 7th and 8th highest share of \"newcomer pupils\". \"Newcomer\" is the term used by the Northern Irish Department for Education to refer to pupils who don't have satisfactory language skills to participate fully in the school curriculum. How, and when, will the violence end?  Sky's Connor Gillies, who has been in Ballymena reporting on the violence and talking to locals for the past few days, said on Wednesday that \"the talk here is that this unrest is only just beginning,\" adding that \"it could go on for weeks\". Meanwhile, locals have expressed that they don't like the talk from police and politicians that taking to the streets following an alleged sex attack on a teenage girl equates to them being \"racist thugs\". Police have responded to rioters' petrol bombs and bricks with rubber bullets and water cannon onslaughts of their own. There have been tens of arrests, as well as injuries to more than 50 police officers since Monday evening. Violence and disorder in Ballymena raged across Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday, appearing to have largely abated in the town by Thursday. However, the unrest has spread to other areas including Larne, Coleraine, Portadown and Belfast. A senior police officer insisted to Sky News that he did have \"a grip\" on the unravelling situation when questioned by Sky News, but officers from Scotland, Wales and England have been sent to bolster the forces of their Northern Irish colleagues. Anti-migrant rhetoric  From 7-12 June, 39,000 Ballymena-related posts on X mentioned \"migrants\", with around 95% of them deemed to be negative by social media analysis tool Talkwalker. Well-known far-right activist Tommy Robinson, who thanked X-owner Elon Musk for his support when he was released from prison four months early on 27 May, was the most influential poster. His 14 X posts about Ballymena between 7-12 June reached an average of 1.3 million accounts each.

There will also be a minute's silence at the event following Thursday's crash in the city of Ahmedabad, western India. Following the crash, which killed at least 241 people, the King asked for some amendments to be made to his traditional birthday parade on Saturday. A palace spokesperson said Charles wanted the alterations \"as a mark of respect for the lives lost, the families in mourning and all the communities affected by this awful tragedy\". The minute's silence will be held after the King inspects the guard on Horse Guards Parade. It will be signalled in the traditional way by a Last Post and Reveille. Charles and the senior royals riding in the ceremony will wear black armbands, as will postilions, coachmen and coachwomen from the Royal Mews. They will not be worn by family members who are wearing civilian clothes. The King said he and the Queen were \"desperately shocked by the terrible events in Ahmedabad\" after the crash on Thursday.  A statement from Buckingham Palace continued: \"Our special prayers and deepest possible sympathy are with the families and friends of all those affected by this appallingly tragic incident across so many nations, as they await news of their loved ones. \"I would like to pay a particular tribute to the heroic efforts of the emergency services and all those providing help and support at this most heartbreaking and traumatic time.\" Union flags have today been flown at half-mast on all royal residences and government buildings. Alterations have been made to the Trooping event before. In 2017, Queen Elizabeth requested a minute's silence to be held during the parade as a mark of respect to those who died in the Grenfell Tower fire three days earlier.

A decade later, in 1660, the regiment marched down from Berwick to help restore the monarchy, dissolve Parliament and bring King Charles II back to the throne. More than 1,000 soldiers and 200 horses from the Household Division will be involved in the spectacular display, with members of the Royal Family also taking part on horseback or travelling along the Mall in carriages. Last year, the King joined Camilla in a carriage, rather than riding, after being diagnosed with cancer months earlier in February. It's been reported he will do the same this year, but this has not been confirmed by the palace. The event will finish with the traditional balcony moment, as members of the Royal Family gather to watch a flypast of military aircraft, including The Red Arrows."

        "Content": " David Beckham has called it \"truly humbling\" and an \"emotional moment\" to be made a knight in the King's Birthday Honours. The former England captain receives the honour alongside The Who frontman Roger Daltrey and Oscar-winning actor Gary Oldman. Singer and actress Elaine Paige, novelist Pat Baker, and former defence secretary Penny Mordaunt have been awarded damehoods. Meanwhile, Strictly Come Dancing hosts Tess Daley and Claudia Winkleman, as well as darts stars Luke Littler and Luke Humphries, will all get MBEs. Beckham was made an OBE in 2003, but now finally becomes Sir David after being in the running for many years. He gets the honour for his services to sport and charity. Sir David was said to be close to a knighthood in 2014, but reportedly lost out after HM Customs and Revenue flagged his involvement in an alleged tax avoidance scheme. \"Growing up in east London with parents and grandparents who were so patriotic and proud to be British, I never could have imagined I would receive such a truly humbling honour,\" he told PA news agency. \"To have played for and captained my country was the greatest privilege of my career, and literally a boyhood dream come true,\" added the former Manchester United and Real Madrid star. Sir David, who recently turned 50, was seen chatting to the King the day before his honour was announced as part of his role as an ambassador for the monarch's foundation. He said he'd been fortunate to \"represent Britain around the world and work with incredible organisations that are supporting communities in need and inspiring the next generation\". Sir David added: \"I'm so lucky to be able to do the work that I do and I'm grateful to be recognised for work that gives me so much fulfilment. \"It will take a little while for the news to sink in but I'm immensely proud and it's such an emotional moment for me to share with my family.\" On the music front, The Who's singer got a knighthood at age 81. Sir Roger - known for hits such as My Generation and Pinball Wizard - led the Teenage Cancer Trust at Royal Albert Hall concert series for more than two decades. \"It's kind of weird, but I am deeply honoured to get this, especially for the charity for the Teenage Cancer Trust, and I accept it on their behalf really, because this honour is really for all unsung heroes,\" said Sir Roger. \"It's a dream come true for me, but it's especially a dream because the charity means so much.\" TV presenter Tess Daly called her MBE \"the greatest surprise of my life\". \"I don't think I've come back down to earth yet,\" she told PA. \"I didn't see it coming, and it almost didn't happen because the letter went to the wrong address. \"And thank goodness someone very kind found me. And so by the time I got it, I only had, I think it was two or three days left to accept it.\" Her co-star on Strictly, Claudia Winkleman, said she was \"incredibly grateful\" to be recognised. \"I will buy a hat and am taking my mum [to receive the honour]. I am ridiculously lucky and will celebrate with Tess by doing a paso doble,\" she said. West End legend Elaine Page - who has starred in shows such as Cats and Evita - was also honoured for services to music and charity. The singer said she was in \"shock\" at becoming a dame \"I've got all these different emotions coming at me all at once,\" said the 77-year-old. I'm proud and I feel grateful and I'm thrilled and surprised, and so it's been quite a lot to take in.\" Dame Elaine has roles at two charities - The Children's Trust and The Dan Maskell Tennis Trust, which supports disabled tennis players. She's also presented a BBC radio show for more than 20 years.

Eleven-year-old disability campaigner Carmela Chillery-Watson is the youngest to be recognised after helping raise more than Â£400,000 for Muscular Dystrophy UK. The oldest is 106-year-old William Irwin, founder of the Coleraine Winemakers Club, who gets a BEM (British Empire Medal) for services to the community. However, the top accolade has been awarded to sculptor Sir Antony Gormley, the man behind the Angel of the North, who is made Companion of Honour for services to art. There can only be 65 companions at any one time. Other notable names on the list include former defence secretary Penny Mordaunt - who famously had a prominent role holding a sword at the King's coronation - and is now a dame; and former EastEnders actress Anita Dobson, who gets an OBE."

        "Content": "\n          Wales reporter\n              @TomosGruffydd\n A man motivated by anti-government ideology has been jailed for life for attempting to murder an officer during an attack on a police station in South Wales. Alexander Dighton, 28, who injured three officers during the attack outside Talbot Green police station in Rhondda Cynon Taf on 31 January, was sentenced to at least 22 years behind bars. The defendant, who was wearing a bullet-proof vest during the attack, was armed with a Molotov cocktail, a knife, a hatchet and a wooden pole. He caused damage to police vehicles, before attacking the officers as they attempted to restrain him - stabbing one in the leg, punching another in the head and swinging a pole at another. Two of the officers were taken to hospital to receive treatment. Dighton, from Pontyclun, had previously pleaded guilty to a total of 10 offences at the Old Bailey in London, including the attempted murder of a police officer, attempting to cause grievous bodily harm with intent, assault, attempted arson, possession of a bladed article and criminal damage. 'Serious violence' Prosecuting, Nicholas Hearn told the court that Dighton was \"intent on serious violence\" and had targeted the police station in an attempt to \"force a confrontation with police officers\". Police Constable Steph Fleming \"drew her Taser\" when she saw Dighton as she exited the station, while the defendant \"continued to smash the windows\" of a police vehicle. In footage played in court, the defendant could be heard telling the officer, \"I am fed up\" and \"I am done\". He also made reference to the number 75 and later clarified in a police interview that the comments were relating to \"grooming gangs\". When he was arrested and cautioned he told the arresting officer: \"Your government is vulnerable.\" He told officers during an interview the motivation for the attack was to \"let it be known that 'his tolerance of the government had come to an end'\". The court heard the defendant had previously been reported to the government's Prevent scheme by his sister due to his \"racist and anti-Muslim views\". 'Fight or flight' PC Fleming attempted to Taser the defendant, but it had \"no effect\" on him as he was wearing a bullet-proof vest. She said in evidence that she had \"never felt this level of fear before and never want to feel it again\". Detective Constable Jack Cotton, who was stabbed in his leg during the incident, said in a victim impact statement that the night of the attack was \"the most [he'd] ever feared\" for his or a colleague's safety. \"If Alexander Dighton had not been detained when he was, the outcome would have been completely different, and potentially fatal,\" he added. Detective Constable Joshua Emlyn, who restrained the defendant in a \"head lock\", was punched in the head, in what he described as \"a fight or flight situation\". Police Sergeant Richard Coleman, who was struck by the defendant's pole, said he can remember being hit \"with incredible force\". He also spoke of the toll the incident had taken on his family, saying it \"had far more of an impact upon [his] wife than [he] could ever have imagined\". 'Terrorist connection' Chief Constable Jeremy Vaughan from South Wales Police said in his victim impact statement that the force had undertaken a \"review of the CCTV system\" at the station in an attempt to \"reassure\" police officers and staff. \"I am immensely proud of the action of those officers who apprehended the defendant on the night,\" he added. \"Their actions in really difficult and dangerous circumstances prevented tragedy.\" When asked by the judge whether there was anything he wanted to say in his own defence, Dighton, who was unrepresented, said: \"I don't care about myself.\" \"What I think is important is that we have a genuine conversation about where Britain is,\" he added. Passing sentence on Thursday, Judge Lucraft KC said that \"serious violence was clearly your motivation\". \"I am entirely satisfied that all of the offences here have a terrorist connection,\" he added. The sentences for the other offences will run concurrently to the life sentence for attempted murder, the judge said. Speaking after the case, Chief Superintendent Stephen Jones, from South Wales Police, told Sky News the officers involved were \"recovering well\". \"The physical wounds are healing, but obviously the mental scars of such an unprecedented, determined, violent attack will take a considerable amount of time to heal,\" he said.

        "Content": " The only survivor of the Air India plane crash says he thought he was \"going to die\". Vishwash Kumar Ramesh, a 40-year-old British national, managed to walk away from the wreckage. He was \"disoriented with multiple injuries all over his body... but he seems to be out of danger\", according to a doctor who examined him. There had been 242 people on board flight AI171 when it came down. Among the passengers and crew on the Gatwick-bound aircraft were 169 Indian nationals, 53 Britons, seven Portuguese nationals and one Canadian national. The Boeing 787-8 Dreamliner crashed into a doctors' hostel in a residential area on Thursday, moments after taking off from Ahmedabad airport, in western India. India plane crash: Follow live updates  Vidhi Chaudhary, a senior police officer in Ahmedabad, said Mr Ramesh was sat in seat 11A, located next to an emergency exit, and \"managed to escape by jumping out the emergency door\". Speaking from his hospital bed, Mr Ramesh said he \"still can't believe\" he survived. He said he thought he \"was also going to die\" but he then \"opened [his] eyes\". \"I pulled out the belt from under my seat and tried to escape. Then I managed to do it,\" he told DD India.  Mr Ramesh said \"within the first mile\" after take-off \"it felt like the plane was stuck\" and \"like something had happened\". \"Then a light came on, like a green and white light came on inside the plane,\" he added. \"The pilot was trying to give it a bit of a push to push it forward, but it was struggling. But it went straight into a building.\" He said the side where he landed was not the hostel side and as soon as the plane door broke, he \"could see that it was open for [him] and [he had] a chance to get out\". He said that his brother, Ajay, was seated in a different row on the plane. \"He was travelling with me and I can't find him anymore. Please help me find him,\" he told the Hindustan Times.  'Bodies all around me' Mr Ramesh continued: \"It all happened so quickly. When I got up, there were bodies all around me. I was scared. I stood up and ran. There were pieces of the plane all around me. \"Someone grabbed hold of me and put me in an ambulance and brought me to the hospital.\" From his hospital bed, Mr Ramesh also met India's prime minister Narendra Modi. Speaking in Leicester, Mr Ramesh's brother Nayan told Sky's Shamaan Freeman-Powell that their father was on the phone to Mr Ramesh while the plane was still on the runway. \"My dad called him,\" the 27-year-old said. \"And Vishwash said 'oh we're going to take off soon'.\"  Two minutes later, their father received a video call from Mr Ramesh to say the plane had crashed and he had survived. \"He video-called my dad as he crashed and said 'Oh the plane's crashed. I don't know where my brother is. I don't see any other passengers. I don't know how I'm alive - how I exited the plane',\" Nayan said. Air India has confirmed 229 passengers and 12 crew members died, but authorities have not confirmed how many people on the ground were killed or injured.

Also on the flight were married couple Fiongal and Jamie Greenlaw-Meek from west London, who had posted a video from the airport on their Instagram feed shortly before boarding. Gatwick Airport said in a statement that a reception centre was being set up where information and support will be provided for relatives of those on board.

Oxford Crown Court heard Daniel Gonzalez, 41, had drunk half a litre of brandy before pushing past his elderly dad on the stairs, causing him to fall on 15 December 2024. Danny Robinson KC, prosecuting, said Matias Gonzalez, 79, had a long-standing heart condition and used a pacemaker. The court was told the retired car factory worker lost his balance and fell down the staircase at their home in the Garsington area of Oxford, suffering fatal head injuries from which he died in hospital.

        "Content": "\n          Security and Defence Editor\n              @haynesdeborah\n  Israel's offensive is not just aimed at degrading Iran's nuclear ambitions, but also its ability to retaliate, according to analysts. A barrage of Israeli airstrikes and drones hit Iranian nuclear facilities as well as military targets in the early hours of Friday morning, followed by subsequent waves in an operation that the Israeli prime minister warned \"will continue for as many days as it takes to remove this threat\". Israel-Iran latest: Iran retaliates against airstrikes The Israel Defence Forces (IDF) said Iran's top three military chiefs, as well as other commanders, had been killed - a serious blow to the Iranian regime, as these men would have been key in planning Iran's response. \"The breadth and scale of these strikes - against senior Iranian officials and other military facilities in addition to nuclear sites - suggest this operation is intended to not just dissuade Iran from pursuing nuclear weapons, but also cripple any potential military response and even to destabilise the regime,\" said Matthew Savill, the director of military sciences at the Royal United Services (RUSI) thinktank. The most significant target so far is the country's main nuclear enrichment facility at Natanz.  An Israeli military spokesman said \"significant damage\" had been caused at Natanz, while the UN's nuclear watchdog confirmed it had been struck. Iran's other main nuclear enrichment site at Fordow has not yet been struck. Analysts say for Israel to succeed in setting back Iranian nuclear ambitions, it would need to destroy the infrastructure at Fordow too. However, it is built into a mountain and is approximately 80 to 90 metres underground.  Israel would need to launch multiple raids to have an effect, or receive support from US aircraft that carry bigger bombs. Analysts have questioned whether Israel will be able to set back Iran's nuclear ambitions as much as it wants through military means alone, and may end up having the opposite effect. Read more: Why did Israel attack Iran? Iranian nuclear sites are dispersed across the country, with the most sensitive locations, such as a vast nuclear enrichment facility at Fordow, contained in bunkers built deep underground. Killing nuclear scientists - also part of the Israeli operation - will also not remove the country's nuclear knowledge, which can be rebuilt. Darya Dolzikovaâ€‹, a senior research fellow on proliferation and nuclear policy at RUSI, warned that the offensive may harden Tehran's resolve to develop nuclear weapons. \"I think that is a real threat,\" she said. The Iranian regime has always insisted its nuclear programme is purely for civilian use. As well as targeting nuclear sites, Israel has also gone after the military commanders who would direct Iran's anticipated retaliation. This includes Iran's military chief, Major General Mohammad Bagheri, and the leader of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, Major General Hossein Salami. ðŸ‘‰Listen to The World with Richard Engel and Yalda Hakim on your podcast appðŸ‘ˆ Gregory Brew, a senior analyst at the Eurasia Group, wrote on social media: \"Most of Iran's senior military leadership -and the individuals who would have planned the retaliation for this attack - are dead.\" Israel also claims to have struck Iranian air defences and taken out dozens of radars and missile launchers, again impacting on Iran's ability to retaliate. Whether or not this tactic has been effective will soon become clear as Iran readies its response. Israel says the Iranians have so far launched about 100 attack drones that its forces are working to intercept.

        "Content": " Iran claims it has shot down two Israeli jets and that its response to Friday night's attacks on nuclear and military infrastructure has begun. The reports emerged as smoke was seen rising from Tel Aviv as Iran launched missiles at the Israeli city. Air raid sirens had been heard across Tel Aviv and Jerusalem as the missiles neared Israel. Footage has shown Israel's Iron Dome air defence system - which uses radars to detect and intercept short-range rockets, missiles and drones - stopping Iranian missiles from striking the city. However, video also suggests some missiles made it through. According to Israeli medics, a total of 34 people were taken to hospital in the Tel Aviv metropolitan area.  In a statement at around 1:50am on Saturday local time (11:50pm on Friday UK time), the Israel Defense Forces said: \"In the past hour, dozens of missiles have been launched from Iran toward the State of Israel. Some of the missiles were intercepted. \"Search and Rescue forces are currently operating in a number of locations across the country in which reports of fallen projectiles were received.\" Meanwhile, the Iranian Army had earlier said in a statement that its \"defence forces successfully hit and destroyed two F-35 fighter jets belonging to the zionist entity, in addition to a large number of small drones\". \"The fate of the two fighter pilots remains unknown and is being investigated,\" the statement added. Follow live: Israel-Iran conflict updates The escalation in the region comes after Israel launched a huge attack on Iran on Friday, which it says was aimed at degrading the country's nuclear ambitions and weakening its military. Israel was able to target key facilities and kill top generals and scientists. It said it airstrikes were necessary before its adversary got any closer to building an atomic weapon. As Israel braced itself for a retaliation, the IRNA state news agency in Iran confirmed this evening that the country's response had begun. It came as a reporter with the Iranian Tasnim news agency said missiles had been fired from Shiraz and Isfahan in Iran towards Israel. Read more:How attacks could impact global economyWho are the nuclear scientists killed by Israel?Why did Israel attack Iran?What are Iran's military capabilities? Sky News correspondent Mark Stone, who used to be based in Jerusalem, has said Iran is trying to \"overwhelm the Iron Dome defence system, which has to be manually reloaded again and again\". He added: \"[The Iron Dome] can be overwhelmed. We saw a number of instances in the videos a moment ago where it was clearly overwhelmed and some of those ballistic missiles hit targets in Tel Aviv.\" Three American officials have told Sky's US partner network NBC News that the US military helped Israel down some Iranian missiles this evening. As the barrage of missiles was fired at Israel, Iran's supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei wrote on X: \"The Zionist regime (Israel) will not remain unscathed from the consequences of its crime. \"The Iranian nation must be guaranteed that our response will not be half-measured,\" he said, adding Iran will \"inflict heavy blows\" on Israel. Mr Khamenei also said that Israel has initiated a war and that Tehran will not allow it to conduct \"hit and run\" attacks without grave consequences.  It came before Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called on Iranians to stand up to the regime in Tehran and help Israel \"clear the path for you to achieve your freedom\". In a video released during Iran's missile attack on Israel, Mr Netanyahu said Israel had taken out a \"large portion\" of Iran's ballistic missile arsenal and its \"most significant enrichment facility\". \"More is on the way,\" he added. \"The regime does not know what hit them, or what will hit them. It has never been weaker. This is your opportunity to stand up and let your voices be heard.\" The Israeli military has told people they can now leave air raid shelters but must stay near them in case of further attacks. The Israel Defence Forces issued instructions earlier this evening telling residents to stay in shelters and minimise movement in open areas. UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer and US President Donald Trump have agreed the mounting conflict between Iran and Israel should be resolved by \"diplomacy and dialogue\".  The two leaders spoke on Friday evening, as western nations began a diplomatic flurry to calm the conflict between Israel and Iran. Sir Keir earlier urged Mr Netanyahu to de-escalate and work towards a \"diplomatic resolution\". Meanwhile, Mr Trump urged Iran to quickly reach an agreement on curbing its nuclear program as Israel vowed to continue its bombardment of the country. Mr Trump framed the volatile moment in the Middle East as a possible \"second chance\" for Iran's leadership to avoid further destruction \"before there is nothing left and save what was once known as the Iranian Empire.\" The US president had urged Mr Netanyahu not to attack Iran. The two leaders had what was described as a heated 40-minute exchange by telephone last Monday. Speaking just hours before the attack, Mr Trump said he feared such action would destroy US hopes of an agreement with Iran to curtail its nuclear programme."

        "Content": " Israel has launched a major attack on Iran and declared a state of emergency over retaliation fears. The operation, called \"Rising Lion\", killed a number of Iranian commanders, scientists and the head of the country's powerful Revolutionary Guard, according to Iranian state media. Iran launched more than 100 drones towards Israel after the country vowed retaliation, an Israeli military spokesperson said. Israel-Iran live: Follow the latest updates Here is what we know so far. What has happened? Shortly after 1am UK time on Friday, Israel launched what it called \"pre-emptive strikes\" against targets in Iran. Explosions were heard in Iran's capital, Tehran, while Iranian state TV broadcast footage of blown-out walls, burning roofs and shattered windows in residential buildings across the city. It reported that blasts had set the Revolutionary Guard's headquarters on fire. Iranian local media site, Nournews, reported 78 people were killed and 329 were injured in the strikes in Tehran.  Bracing for retaliation, Israel closed its airspace and said it was calling up tens of thousands of soldiers to protect the country's borders. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the operation \"will continue for as many days as it takes to remove this threat\". The Israeli military said all of its pilots involved in the strike on Iran returned home unharmed, as the country's armed forces continued assessing the results of the operation. Flights around the Middle East were cancelled as a result of the strikes, with passengers in Iraq, Jordan, Israel, Lebanon, Iran and Dubai facing delays. Where and who was targeted? In a video announcing the military operation, Mr Netanyahu said the strikes hit Iran's main nuclear enrichment site, the Natanz atomic facility. An IDF spokesperson said the site has been \"significantly harmed\" adding the strikes hit an underground facility and other crucial infrastructure. The international atomic watchdog (IAEA) said it was in contact with Iranian authorities regarding radiation levels at the Natanz facility - which is in the central Isfahan province - adding later that there had been no increase in levels. The IDF said the strikes eliminated several senior military commanders of the Iranian regime. Six nuclear scientists were also killed, according to Iranian state media. Scroll through the slider below to see who was killed and what we know about them. For more information, read our full explainer here. Why has Israel launched strikes now? The attack comes amid rising international fears over Iran's nuclear programme, with the UN watchdog warning earlier this week that the country is breaking its obligations for the first time in 20 years. Israel and the US have long feared that Iran is plotting to develop a nuclear weapon. Tehran has repeatedly denied this and insists its programme is for civilian purposes - to generate energy.  Mr Netanyahu claimed on Friday that if Iran wasn't stopped, \"it could produce a nuclear weapon within a very short time\". He went further to claim Iran had in recent years developed enough highly-enriched uranium for \"nine atom bombs\". US and Iranian officials were scheduled to hold a sixth round of talks on Tehran's escalating uranium enrichment programme in Oman on Sunday.  Israel previously launched strikes on Iran in October 2024. Sky News' Middle East correspondent Alistair Bunkall said last year's strikes eliminated much of Iran's air defences, giving the Israeli air force some freedom of movement in Iran's skies. But Iran has been rebuilding those defences, Bunkall adds, so Israel's window to operate was closing. Read more: What does this mean for the rest of the world? Has Iran responded? Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, Iran's supreme leader, warned of \"severe punishment\", claiming Israel targeted \"residential areas\". \"In the enemy's attacks, a number of commanders and scientists were martyred. Their successors and colleagues will immediately continue their duties,\" he said in a statement reported by the Tasnim news agency. Hours after Israeli strikes, Iran launched more than 100 drones in retaliation, an Israel Defence Force (IDF) spokesperson said. The IDF confirmed Israel had begun intercepting unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVS) which it said had been fired from Iran. A second volley of more than 100 drones were then launched towards Israel, which will take several hours to make the journey. Strikes over the past year Tensions between Iran and Israel have boiled over in the past year. Iran has backed, funded and trained several proxy groups across the Middle East region to varying degrees, including Hamas in Gaza, the Houthis in Yemen, Hezbollah in Lebanon and a number of other factions based in Syria and Iraq. Israel accuses Iran of backing militant attacks against it, while Iran says Israel has carried out a number of killings of Iranian officials and scientists - which Israel has not commented on.â€¯ Below are some of the attacks that have happened since April 2024: How has the world reacted? US President Donald Trump wrote on the Truth Social platform that he gave Iran \"chance after chance\" to make a deal, but they \"couldn't get it done\". He wrote: \"I told them [Iran] it would be much worse than anything they know, anticipated, or were told, that the United States makes the best and most lethal military equipment anywhere in the World, BY FAR, and that Israel has a lot of it, with much more to come - And they know how to use it. \"Certain Iranian hardliner's spoke bravely, but they didn't know what was about to happen. They are all DEAD now, and it will only get worse!\" Marco Rubio, US secretary of state, said earlier that America was not involved in the attack and warned Iran not to retaliate against American interests in the region. Mr Rubio added that America believes the strikes are necessary for Israel's self defence. Meanwhile, British Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer urged \"all parties to step back and reduce tensions urgently\". Read analysis from Sky correspondents:The consequences for the region could be massiveIsrael defied Trump and chose to act now The UK is not currently helping to defend Israel from Iranian drone attacks, Sky News' security and defence editor, Deborah Haynes, said. The government will, however, hold an emergency COBRA meeting on Friday, Sky News understands. A Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson said it is paying close attention to the attacks and called on the relevant parties to act in ways that will lead to regional peace and stability. Russia called the Israeli strikes \"unprovoked\" and in \"breach of the United Nations charter\". In the Middle East, the UAE condemned Israel's strikes against Iran \"in the strongest terms\" and expressed \"deep concern\" over the repercussions on regional security. Saudi Arabia also condemned the Israeli attack. Neighbouring Qatar called Israel's attack a \"flagrant violation\" of Iran's sovereignty and security."

        "Content": "\n          Business and economics correspondent\n              @gurpreetnarwan\n The Middle East is the world's foremost oil-producing region and a major centre for maritime trade. Its waterways are a critical thoroughfare for cargo ships transporting oil and container ships with goods and appliances on board. Flare-ups in the Middle East have a predictable impact on the oil price, causing it to spike as investors grow fearful about supply constraints because of possible blockages and attacks on these maritime routes. As a result, shipping insurance premiums also rise, which are ultimately passed on to the consumer. Brent crude, the international benchmark, was up 8%, at $75 (Â£55) a barrel. Follow live: Israel-Iran conflict latest  That has a feed-through across the economy because oil goes into the manufacturing process of many goods and services, whether that's plastic toys or air travel. According to the International Monetary Fund (IMF), inflation in advanced economies rises by about 0.4 percentage points for every 10% increase in oil prices. Some experts are still sanguine about the impact on trade, but the region is already dealing with challenges.

Houthi rebels, backed by Iran, have been attacking ships passing through the Red Sea to the Suez Canal - a major hub route for container shipping. \"This has forced many ships to go the long way around Africa on routes between Asia and Europe, which adds one to two weeks of travel time and around $1m in cost per journey,\" said Sarah Schiffling, an academic at the Hanken School of Economics.  \"Longer travel times also mean that global capacity is reduced as ships are tied up on a journey for longer and that all has ripple effects across global transport networks and supply chains.\" Iran has also repeatedly threatened to block the Strait of Hormuz, which connects the Persian Gulf and the Arabian Sea. ðŸ‘‰Listen to The World with Richard Engel and Yalda Hakim on your podcast appðŸ‘ˆ The strait handles a quarter of the world's oil trade, and analysts at Goldman Sachs predict blockades in the Strait of Hormuz could push prices above $100 (Â£74) per barrel. That being said, this would be an extreme step for Iran that would anger its major customer - China - as well as Qatar and the United Arab Emirates (UAE), two other major oil-producing states, who also rely on the strait."

        "Content": "\n          International affairs editor\n              @DominicWaghorn\n  Israel has finally hit Iran's nuclear facilities. What happens next and how bad could it get? Israel first. Israelis have always regarded Iran's nuclear ambitions as an existential threat. Israel-Iran latest: Iran retaliates against airstrikes  The ayatollahs insist their nuclear programme is entirely peaceful, but their leaders have also talked of wiping Israel off the face of the Earth, and that threat has been taken at face value by Israelis. Benjamin Netanyahu clearly thinks this is the time to act for a number of reasons. \n                  Iran claims it has downed two Israeli jets - as it fires missiles in response to Friday's attacks\n                 \n                  Israel's killing of Iran's top military chiefs a serious blow to regime - but will it impact Tehran's response?\n                 \n                  Israel v Iran: What's next?\n                  Iran has never been weaker internally after nationwide protests a few years ago, and Israel has massively degraded its proxies, Hezbollah and Hamas. And they have a sympathetic president in the White House. Israel may have plenty on its plate in Gaza and southern Lebanon still, but that is not holding its leaders back from seizing the moment. Critics might also wonder whether this is a distraction from the growing diplomatic isolation of Israel over Gaza. Britain has just taken the unprecedented step of sanctioning two Israeli government ministers. France is thought to be poised to recognise Palestine as an independent state. Whatever the reasons, Israel will try to finish what it's started. Equally, Iran will do what it can to stop Israel's attacks. Doing nothing or not enough looks weak, and in the Middle East that is dangerous. But how? Missile and drone attacks on Israel seem certain, but possibly against US assets and allies too. The Trump administration may have tried to distance itself from the Israeli operation. But Iran won't believe that. For Iranians, America and Israel are inextricably linked as part of the same evil. Read more:Watch: Iran and Israel in major conflictIsrael attacks Iran and declares emergencyIran TV shows bomb damage The big fear is Iran starts striking targets in the Persian Gulf. Enough tankers being sunk or oil refineries going up in smoke could have an immediate impact on the global economy. Bad enough and President Trump might call time on Israel's actions. That would be the Iranian hope, at least. So expect the following: Israel continues striking Iran; Iran hits back with all it can; America is forced to help defend Israel; Iran hits both Israel, the US and possibly US allies. That is the predictable bit. Wars follow the laws of unintended consequences. At any point in that escalation, unexpected events could lead to greater escalation. Brace yourself, the coming days could go in a number of directions. If the Persian Gulf becomes the battlefield, we will all feel the consequences."

Flight 171 was carrying 242 people when it struck a medical college hostel less than a minute after taking off from Ahmedabad airport, in western India, bound for Gatwick on Thursday. Among those on board were 169 Indian nationals, 53 Britons, seven Portuguese nationals and one Canadian, the airline said. It has confirmed 241 of those on the Boeing 787 Dreamliner were killed in the crash, with just one survivor - a British man from Leicester. Tributes to those who died in the worst aviation crash in a decade are now being shared. Arjun Patoliya The 37-year-old had been to India to fulfil his wife Bharti's \"final wish\" and scatter her ashes in her hometown in Gujarat, after she died following a battle with cancer. He was returning home to his young daughters, according to a GoFundMe page set up for the girls. It says: \"In a span of just 18 days, two young sisters - only 4 and 8 years old - have lost both of their beloved parents.\" Dr Prateek Joshi and his family Dr Joshi, a radiologist at the Royal Derby Hospital, was on the flight with his wife, Dr Komi Vyas, and their three children, Mirayal, Nakul and Pradyut. In a post on Facebook, Derby Hindu Temple said: \"We pray to Lord Shiva to grant eternal peace to the departed souls and to give strength to the bereaved family to bear this immense loss.\" Dr Joshi's colleague Dr Rajeev Singh described him as \"a wonderful man, friend, husband and father, and an exceptional radiologist who was highly respected in his field\". \"It is hard to accept that a man with such a passion for life, and his beautiful young family, have been taken in this way,\" his statement continued. \"His passing has left a profound void, not only in his professional contributions but in the warmth and spirit that he gave to the world every day.\" Akeel Nanabawa, his wife Hannaa Vorajee and their four-year-old daughter The family of three from Gloucester were \"widely loved and deeply respected\", their family said in a statement issued through their imam. Mr Nanabawa ran a recruitment firm and Ms Vorajee volunteered at a local Islamic school, and was a director for an organisation promoting understanding of Islam, Imam Abdullah Samad said. Their daughter, Sara Nanabawa, was four years old. The imam, who is headteacher at the school Sara had just started attending, told Sky News: \"She had a smile like the rays of the sun, she would light up the room. \"She was exactly what her parents would have wanted her to be, she took a lot of good qualities from her parents. Staff at the school are absolutely devastated.\" He said of her parents: \"They were widely loved and deeply respected. His quiet generosity, her warmth and kindness, and their daughter's bright, joyful spirit made a lasting impact on everyone who knew them.\" Mariam and Javed Ali Syed and their two children The couple and their two children - five-year-old Zayn and four-year-old Amani - were returning from a holiday in India, Ms Ali Syed's sister-in-law told the Telegraph. The mother-of-two reportedly worked for Harrods for a decade while Mr Ali Syed is reported to have worked at a London hotel. Speaking to the Telegraph, Yasmine Hassan said of the couple's two children: \"They are so small, they are five and four.

The scale of the tragedy has been compounded by its location. The plane came down right in the heart of a built-up neighbourhood, with the front of the aircraft crashing into residential quarters for medical students. The wheels and tail of the plane are embedded in the top floor of one of the buildings, where many had gathered for lunch in a dining hall. Plates are still on tables - evidence that residents were eating when the aircraft tore through. There were at least 23 victims on the ground, including students, doctors and family members. Some are in a critical condition.  The cause of the crash remains unknown. Investigators will now begin the long and complex process of establishing what went wrong. But many families will grapple with the unimaginable loss after one of the worst disasters in India's aviation history."

        "Content": "\n          Sports correspondent\n              @RobHarris\n Among Donald Trump's gilded additions to the Oval Office, one ornament stands out: symbolising power plays in sport and geopolitics.  The outlandish, elaborate golden discs form football's newest prize: the Club World Cup that will be handed out in New Jersey on 14 July, after 63 matches across 11 American cities. The trophy has become part of presidential theatre, prominent for all the major announcements - from nuclear warnings to Iran to celebrating the trade deal with Britain. It was hand-delivered to Mr Trump three months ago by Gianni Infantino, the FIFA president whose name is etched into it. Twice. This whole competition - supersizing an old, little-regarded format from seven to 32 clubs - is very much Mr Infantino's creation to reshape world football and extend FIFA's reach into the club game. Read more: Liverpool tries to heal from trophy parade trauma For a trophy inspired by NASA missions into space - featuring astronomy and maps - it also signals how Mr Infantino has gained influence in Mr Trump's orbit. Becoming the commander-in-chief's closest non-American associate has secured invites to political speeches as well as sporting trips. The alliance - contentious given Mr Trump's rhetoric and interventions on topics such as immigration and diversity - is defended as fast-tracking decision-making at the highest level. This Club World Cup (CWC) is in many ways the test event for the more complex tournament next summer, as the World Cup is contested by 48 men's national teams across the US, Canada, and Mexico. \"I think it is absolutely crucial for the success of a World Cup to have a close relationship with the president,\" Mr Infantino said. But the CWC begins against the backdrop of immigration raids and violent protests in Los Angeles amid concerns fans could be targeted or denied entry to FIFA events. Saudi Arabia's role This was a tournament intended to launch in China in 2021 until the pandemic shook the world and interest in football waned in the country once heavily courted by FIFA. And so attention shifted to Saudi Arabia. It can appear that Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman has bailed out Mr Infantino, bankrolling his pet project. There was little interest from FIFA's usual World Cup broadcasters - BBC and ITV in Britain - until loss-making streamer DAZN stepped in with a $1bn (Â£736m) deal, just around the time Saudi Arabia was handed the hosting of the 2034 World Cup. That was followed by DAZN selling a 10% stake to SURJ, an investment firm owned by Saudi's sovereign wealth fund, chaired by MBS. And then, completing the circle, the Public Investment Fund signed up as a CWC sponsor less than two weeks before the tournament begins. PIF also owns Al-Hilal, who qualified as Asian Champions League winners for the CWC in a group featuring Real Madrid. A Super League? Given Mr Infantino maintains the extravaganza features the 32 best teams in the world, what, for example, are RB Salzburg doing there? While four of Europe's slots went to recent Champions League winners, the other eight went to the best-performing teams ranked by European results in recent years. And while Liverpool should have made the cut by that measure, FIFA imposed a cap on two teams per country unless they had all qualified as competition winners. So FIFA only has Chelsea and Manchester City, although Lionel Messi's Inter Miami were handed a place as national champions despite not actually winning the main American soccer title. To some, this could seem to be the genesis of a Super League - the aborted European breakaway in 2021 - in a different guise. Champions League organiser UEFA once tried to thwart the CWC, given it could diminish the status of its own competition, before caving-in to FIFA. And while selling tickets and finding viewers will be challenging, it will be lucrative for the participants. That Saudi $1bn (Â£736m) is all going back to clubs, with up to $125m (Â£92m) for the winners. Workload concerns Chelsea and City have already played 57 matches this season - now up to seven more are being bolted on.  And their players could have had up to 10 international matches over the last year, including two in the gap between the end of the domestic season and the CWC trip. It is why - in plans first revealed by Sky News in 2023 - global players' union FIFPRO has launched a legal challenge claiming FIFA has abused a dominant position to risk the health of players. But the European Commission has not officially taken up the case to prevent this launch. And, given that other FIFA events have already expanded - or are expanding - to 48 finalists, the Club World Cup could be here to stay - and even get even bigger. There is also still the delayed women's tournament, which is set to finally launch in 2028."

Tata Sons, Air India's owner, said it would give around Â£86,000 to the families of each person who died, cover the medical costs of those injured and support the rebuild of the medical hostel. British nationals who require consular assistance are advised to call 020 7008 5000, while Air India has set up hotlines to provide information on +91 806 2779 200 for foreign nationals or 1800 5691 444 if calling from India."

        "Content": "\n          US correspondent\n              @skydavidblevins\n One word did the heavy lifting in Marco Rubio's statement: unilateral. The US secretary of state was keen to emphasise that strikes on Iran were Israel's decision alone. Israel-Iran latest: Iran retaliates after airstrikes But that was not enough for Iran's foreign minister, who claimed Israel could not have carried out the attack without support from America. President Donald Trump had urged Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu not to attack Iran.  The two leaders had what was described as a heated 40-minute exchange by telephone last Monday. Speaking just hours before the attack, Trump said he feared such action would destroy US hopes of agreement with Iran. Time and time again, the US president has insisted that Iran cannot have a nuclear weapon. But the Americans and Iranians have been engaged in negotiations for months as the US president sought a diplomatic solution. At one point, he even appeared to concede slightly on enrichment.  But Israel claimed the weaponisation of enriched uranium posed \"a clear and present danger to Israel's very survival\". Netanyahu values his relationship with Trump, but the timing of this action was on Israel's terms.

Afterwards, they said their number one priority was the safety of US personnel. America had already restricted the movement of its staff in Israel and begun evacuating non-essential staff from its embassy in Baghdad. Marco Rubio sent a clear warning: \"Iran should not target US interests or personnel.\" They don't want to be dragged into this, but have stated that they will protect Israel, if necessary. America didn't choose this moment, but knows the threat this escalation poses for US staff in the region."

Its waterways are a critical thoroughfare for cargo ships transporting oil and container ships with goods and appliances on board. Flare-ups in the Middle East have a predictable impact on the oil price, causing it to spike as investors grow fearful about supply constraints because of possible blockages and attacks on these maritime routes. As a result, shipping insurance premiums also rise, which are ultimately passed on to the consumer. Brent crude, the international benchmark, was up 8%, at $75 (Â£55) a barrel. Follow live: Israel-Iran conflict latest  That has a feed-through across the economy because oil goes into the manufacturing process of many goods and services, whether that's plastic toys or air travel. According to the International Monetary Fund (IMF), inflation in advanced economies rises by about 0.4 percentage points for every 10% increase in oil prices. Some experts are still sanguine about the impact on trade, but the region is already dealing with challenges.

        "Content": " Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has called for \"restraint\" and \"diplomacy\" after Israel launched a barrage of airstrikes on Iran early on Friday. He called reports of Israel's so-called Operation Rising Lion \"concerning\", but stopped short of condemning it. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Israel had targeted the \"heart of Iran's nuclear enrichment programme\", which he feared would eventually be aimed at Israel. Iran promised \"severe punishment\" for the attacks, which killed several top commanders and nuclear scientists, and launched 100 drones towards Israel in an initial response. Follow latest: Israel attacks Iran's nuclear sites  In a statement on Friday, Mr Starmer urged \"all parties to step back and reduce tensions urgently\". He added: \"Escalation serves no one in the region. Stability in the Middle East must be the priority and we are engaging partners to de-escalate. \"Now is the time for restraint, calm and a return to diplomacy.\" The UK does not appear to have been warned in advance of Israel's plan to attack Iran. David Lammy, the foreign secretary, had been due to travel to Washington on Friday to meet his American counterpart. The trip was cancelled once it became known that Israel had launched its operation. A Whitehall source said the late cancellation of Mr Lammy's travel plans indicated the UK had not been alerted in advance to the timing of the attack. However, the UK had been aware of the increasing likelihood of an Israeli mission to strike Iran's nuclear facilities, given the rhetoric from the Israeli government in recent weeks. Mr Lammy called it a \"dangerous moment\" and said \"stability in the Middle East is vital for global security\". Speaking to Sky News this morning, British industry minister Sarah Jones also said the UK had not been involved in the Israeli military operation. It is understood British warplanes are not currently involved in helping to defend Israel's skies from any Iranian counterattacks. This could change as the situation develops. Additional forces could well be sent to a key Royal Air Force base in Cyprus, where Typhoon jets are stationed. The deployment of reinforcements to RAF Akrotiri has happened in the past during times of crisis in the Middle East. The US also said it had not been involved in Israel's attack on Iran, and warned against any retaliation targeting American interests or personnel. US President Donald Trump had previously urged Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu not to attack Iran while Washington negotiates a nuclear deal with the country. In his first public comment about the attacks, he again urged Iran to reach a deal with Washington on its nuclear programme, warning on his Truth Social platform that Israel's attacks \"will only get worse\". Without saying whether he was privy to specific Israeli plans, the US president said \"there is still time to make this slaughter, with the next already planned attacks being even more brutal, come to an end\".

Spokesperson for the Chinese foreign ministry Lin Jian said: \"China opposes the violation of Iran's sovereignty, security and territorial integrity, opposes the intensification of contradictions, the expansion of conflicts, and the suddenrise in temperature of the regional situation.\" Takeshi Iwaya, Japan's foreign minister, said: \"Amid ongoing diplomatic efforts, including talks between the United States and Iran, to achieve a peaceful resolution of the Iranian nuclear issue, the use of military force is deeply regrettable.\""

        "Content": "Campaigners have described losing a High Court challenge over the imposition of VAT on private school fees as a \"huge disappointment\". They say the \"unjust legislation\" has already had a \"devastating impact\" on independent schools. During a hearing in London in April, a group of schools, pupils and their parents argued that for some children, their needs are not met by state schools. They claimed the policy of applying VAT to fees, which came into force in January, is discriminatory, incompatible with human rights law and was being applied \"irrespective\" of a family's need. Caroline Santer, headteacher at The King's School in Hampshire, said that the judgment was \"a huge disappointment\" but added \"we will continue to challenge the legality of this policy\". \"This unjust legislation has already had a devastating impact on the independent school sector, causing many children to leave their schools and even many schools to close.\" Ben Snowdon, headteacher at Emmanuel School in Derby, agreed that the policy would be \"devastating for independent Christian schools and many other low-cost independent schools\". \n                  Starmer doesn't rule out scrapping two-child benefit cap after free school meals expansion\n                 \n                  Labour needs to focus on the working class, says Andy BurnhamÂ \n                 \n                  Fears for future of Welsh rugby amid cuts to grassroots scheme\n                 \"It is especially concerning to parents who are not from affluent backgrounds and who have children with special education needs (SEN),\" he said. Sophie Kemp, from legal firm Kingsley Napley, which represented the claimants, said: \"It was important to challenge VAT on school fees, which both the government and the court recognised had a discriminatory impact on children at religious schools as well as significant impact on children with SEN.\" But Sir James Eadie KC, representing the Treasury, HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) and the Department for Education (DfE), said abolishing the VAT exemption for private school fees was a feature of Labour's manifesto and is expected to yield between Â£1.5bn and Â£1.7bn a year. Read more from Sky News:Starmer talks two-child benefit capThe rising cost of state schoolsSome parents 'excusing poor behaviour' Three judges at the High Court said any VAT exemption would mean the government would lose out on \"a very substantial slice of the revenue it hopes to raise\", which could be used for SEN provision in state schools. \"The aim was redistributive - and unapologetically so,\" the judges said. During the 94-page ruling, they also wrote there is a \"broad margin of discretion in deciding how to balance the interests of those adversely affected by the policy against the interests of others who may gain from public provision funded by the money it will raise\". Referencing the European Convention on Human Rights, the judges added that the legislation does \"not include any right to require the state to facilitate one's child's access to a private school\", even if parents prefer a religious one."

The former England captain receives the honour alongside The Who frontman Roger Daltrey and Oscar-winning actor Gary Oldman. Singer and actress Elaine Paige, novelist Pat Baker, and former defence secretary Penny Mordaunt have been awarded damehoods. Meanwhile, Strictly Come Dancing hosts Tess Daley and Claudia Winkleman, as well as darts stars Luke Littler and Luke Humphries, will all get MBEs. Beckham was made an OBE in 2003, but now finally becomes Sir David after being in the running for many years. He gets the honour for his services to sport and charity. Sir David was said to be close to a knighthood in 2014, but reportedly lost out after HM Customs and Revenue flagged his involvement in an alleged tax avoidance scheme. \"Growing up in east London with parents and grandparents who were so patriotic and proud to be British, I never could have imagined I would receive such a truly humbling honour,\" he told PA news agency. \"To have played for and captained my country was the greatest privilege of my career, and literally a boyhood dream come true,\" added the former Manchester United and Real Madrid star. Sir David, who recently turned 50, was seen chatting to the King the day before his honour was announced as part of his role as an ambassador for the monarch's foundation. He said he'd been fortunate to \"represent Britain around the world and work with incredible organisations that are supporting communities in need and inspiring the next generation\". Sir David added: \"I'm so lucky to be able to do the work that I do and I'm grateful to be recognised for work that gives me so much fulfilment. \"It will take a little while for the news to sink in but I'm immensely proud and it's such an emotional moment for me to share with my family.\" On the music front, The Who's singer got a knighthood at age 81. Sir Roger - known for hits such as My Generation and Pinball Wizard - led the Teenage Cancer Trust at Royal Albert Hall concert series for more than two decades. \"It's kind of weird, but I am deeply honoured to get this, especially for the charity for the Teenage Cancer Trust, and I accept it on their behalf really, because this honour is really for all unsung heroes,\" said Sir Roger. \"It's a dream come true for me, but it's especially a dream because the charity means so much.\" TV presenter Tess Daly called her MBE \"the greatest surprise of my life\". \"I don't think I've come back down to earth yet,\" she told PA. \"I didn't see it coming, and it almost didn't happen because the letter went to the wrong address. \"And thank goodness someone very kind found me. And so by the time I got it, I only had, I think it was two or three days left to accept it.\" Her co-star on Strictly, Claudia Winkleman, said she was \"incredibly grateful\" to be recognised. \"I will buy a hat and am taking my mum [to receive the honour]. I am ridiculously lucky and will celebrate with Tess by doing a paso doble,\" she said. West End legend Elaine Page - who has starred in shows such as Cats and Evita - was also honoured for services to music and charity. The singer said she was in \"shock\" at becoming a dame \"I've got all these different emotions coming at me all at once,\" said the 77-year-old. I'm proud and I feel grateful and I'm thrilled and surprised, and so it's been quite a lot to take in.\" Dame Elaine has roles at two charities - The Children's Trust and The Dan Maskell Tennis Trust, which supports disabled tennis players.

The technology can inadvertently activate when hardcore rock, heavy metal, or punk fans are involved in aggressive styles of dancing - sometimes called \"thrashing\", \"slam dancing\" or \"pogoing\". Certain iPhone and Apple Watch models operate a \"crash detection\" feature - turned on by default - which is designed to identify a severe car crash and connect people to emergency services. Even if people are unaware that the feature has been activated, the device will call the emergency services automatically after a 30-second countdown. Some Android mobiles operate a similar service called \"car crash detection\". \"All those calls had to be assessed, with three outbound call attempts completed to ensure there is no threat, risk or harm, taking our contact handlers away from answering true emergency calls,\" police added. They recommended switching on airplane mode or disabling emergency alerts on wearable tech, as well as answering any callbacks so officers know fans are safe.
