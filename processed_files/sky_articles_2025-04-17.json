        "Content": "\n          Scotland correspondent\n              @ConnorGillies\n  It's like The Godfather, one reformed drug trafficker tells me. The mythical gangster film centred on an organised crime dynasty locked in a transfer of power. Communities in Scotland currently have a front row seat to a new war of violence, torture, and taunts as feuding drug lords and notorious families grapple for control of Glasgow and Edinburgh. There have been more than a dozen brutal attacks over the past six weeks - ranging from fire bombings to attacks on children and gun violence. Victims left for dead, businesses up in flames Gangsters have filmed themselves setting fire to buildings and homes connected to the associates and relatives of their bitter rivals. The main aim, they boast, is to \"exterminate\" the opposition. The taunting footage, accompanied by the song Keep On Running by The Spencer Davis Group, has been plastered over social media as part of a deliberate game of goading. A 12-year-old boy and 72-year-old woman were left for dead when teenagers wearing balaclavas burst into a home in north Glasgow. Garages and businesses have gone up in flames. Shots were fired at an Edinburgh house. Signals are being sent of who wants control of Scotland's dark criminal underworld. What's caused the gang war? The former director of the Scottish Crime and Drug Enforcement Agency, Graeme Pearson, explains how a \"vacuum of leadership\" is playing a part. Last October, Glasgow-based cocaine kingpin Jamie Stevenson, known as The Iceman, was jailed after orchestrating a Â£100m cocaine shipment stashed in banana boxes from South America. The mob leader was one of Britain's most wanted, running his business like another on-screen criminal enterprise: The Sopranos. The 59-year-old fugitive went on the run before eventually being hunted and apprehended by police while out jogging in the Netherlands. 'Old scores to settle' But paranoia was running rife about how this notorious gangster could be brought down. Was there a grass? Was it one of their own? It further fuelled divisions and forced new alliances to be forged across Scotland's organised criminal networks. It wasn't until The Iceman case came to court that it was revealed an encrypted messaging platform, known as EncroChat, had been infiltrated by law enforcement. It ultimately led to Stevenson pleading guilty. Ex-senior drug enforcement officer Mr Pearson told Sky News: \"It is a complex picture because you have got people who are in prison who still want to have influence outside and look after what was their business. \"On the outside you've got wannabes who are coming forward, and they think this is an opportunity for them, and you have got others have old scores to settle that they could not settle when crime bosses were around.\" Read more from Sky News:Scientists find strongest evidence yet of aliensWidow has 'no regrets' over helping husband's suicide Mr Pearson describes a toxic mix swirling to create outbursts of violence unfolding in Scotland. He concluded: \"All that mixes together - and the greed for the money that comes from drugs, and from the kudos that comes from being a 'main man', and you end up with competition, violence, and the kind of incidents we have seen over the past four to six weeks.\" New wave of violence 'barbaric' Glasgow man Mark Dempster is a former addict, dealer, and drug smuggler who is now an author and respected counsellor helping people quit drinking and drugs. He describes the \"jostle for power\" as not a new concept among Glasgow's high profile gangland families. \"There is always going to be someone new who wants to control the markets. It is like The Godfather. There is no difference between Scotland, Albania, or India,\" he said. Mr Dempster suggests a shift in tactics in Glasgow and Edinburgh in recent weeks, with 12-year-olds being viciously attacked in the middle of the night. \"It is barbaric. When young people, children, get pulled into the cross fire. It takes it to a different level. \"At least with the old mafiosa they had an unwritten rule that no children, no other family members. You would deal directly with the main people that were your opposition.\" Police Scotland is racing to get control of the situation, but declined to speak to Sky News about its ongoing operation. It has been suggested 100 officers are working on this case, with \"arrests imminent\". But this is at the very sharp end of sophisticated criminal empires where the police are not feared, there are fierce vendettas and, clearly, power is up for grabs."

Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer handed over an invitation from the King when he visited Washington in February. Trump teases return to UK - latest updates Buckingham Palace previously only said the visit would happen \"when diaries allow\", but Mr Trump told reporters on Thursday: \"I think they are setting a date for September.\" \"I don't know how it can be bigger than the last one,\" he said. \"The last one was incredible, but they say the next one will be even more important.\" Mr Trump will become the only elected political leader in modern times to be invited to two state visits by a British monarch. The president called the UK a \"great country\" in his comments at the White House on Thursday and said it was \"an honour to be a friend of King Charles and the family, William\". His first state visit was in 2019, when he was hosted by the late Queen. Second-term US presidents who have already made a state visit usually get tea or lunch with the monarch at Windsor Castle, as was the case for George W Bush and Barack Obama.

The Royal Family's soft power diplomacy is viewed as a way of currying favour with the president, who's known for his love of the monarchy and links to the UK through his mother, who was born on the Isle of Lewis in Scotland. It comes as the government seeks an economic deal with the US, in the hope of potentially lessening the impact of the president's tariffs."

        "Content": "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has accused US envoy Steve Witkoff of \"spreading Russian narratives\" about the Ukraine war - as he said a much-anticipated minerals deal was moving closer. His comments came as Mr Witkoff was in Paris for talks with Ukrainian and European officials. The diplomat met Vladimir Putin last week and later told Fox News he had held \"compelling\" discussions with the Russian leader.  \"This peace deal is about these so-called five territories, but there's so much more to it,\" he said.  He appeared to be referencing occupied Crimea and the four regions annexed in sham referendums in 2022: Kherson, Luhansk, Donetsk and Zaporizhzhia. The votes were widely condemned and dismissed by the West - and Russia still does not fully control these regions - but Mr Witkoff has been accused of parroting Moscow's line. \n                  Muscles from Brussels Jean-Claude Van Damme sends 'big kiss' to Putin with ambassadorial job request\n                 \n                  Ukrainian forces 'strike Russian brigade' behind deadly missile attack on Sumy\n                 \n                  Russian journalists accused of working with Alexei Navalny jailed for more than five years each\n                 Mr Zelenskyy, speaking at a news conference, also said a \"memorandum of intent\" on a minerals deal with the US could be signed online on Thursday. However, speaking at the White House later - where he was hosting the Italian prime minister, US President Donald Trump said it was likely to be next week. The deal was expected to be done weeks ago but was derailed by the Ukrainian leader's falling out at the White House. President Trump wants to share in profits from Ukraine's natural resources in what he says is repayment for military aid. It's hoped America having a stake in the country could also help maintain any truce. In his media conference, Mr Zelenskyy also claimed he had evidence of China helping Russia with artillery. \"We believe that Chinese representatives are engaged in the production of some weapons on the territory of Russia,\" the Ukrainian leader said. He did not specify whether he meant artillery systems or shells. It comes after Ukraine said recently that it had captured two Chinese citizens fighting in the east of the country. US efforts to broker a ceasefire have so far failed to provide a breakthrough, with critics accusing Russia of stalling and not really wanting peace.  President Trump was asked on Thursday how long Mr Putin had to respond to his ceasefire proposal before facing either tariffs or more sanctions. \"We're going to be hearing from them this week, very shortly, actually,\" he told reporters. He also said that while he does not hold President Zelenskyy responsible for the war, he is \"not a big fan\". \"I'm not happy with him, and I'm not happy with anybody involved,\" he said. \"I'm not blaming him, but what I am saying is that I wouldn't say he's done the greatest job. Okay? I'm not a big fan.\" Three killed in drone attack US envoy Mr Witkoff was joined in Paris earlier by US secretary of state Marco Rubio. The men held talks with French, British and German representatives - the so-called \"coalition of the willing\" who could provide security guarantees in the event of a ceasefire. Ukraine's presidential chief of staff, foreign minister and defence minister were also there and a follow-up is scheduled for next week in London.  While a total ceasefire has proved elusive, a 30-day moratorium on striking energy infrastructure targets was previously agreed. However, both sides have accused each other of breaking the agreement. Russian government spokeswoman Maria Zakharova claimed on Thursday that Ukraine had breached it 80 times. President Zelenskyy, meanwhile, said Russian energy attacks had decreased but that it was attacking civilian infrastructures instead. Three people, including a child, were killed overnight in a drone attack on Ukraine's southeastern city of Dnipro, according to officials, with 30 wounded. Local authorities said widespread damage was caused to civilian infrastructure, including an educational institution, residential buildings, a gym and a dormitory. It comes after at least 35 people died in a Russian missile strike on Sumy at the weekend."

        "Content": "\n          Arts and entertainment reporter\n              @BethanyMinelle\n  Alex Garland says while it's \"the most obvious statement about life on this planet\" that the world would be a better place without war, it \"doesn't mean it should never happen\", and there are \"circumstances in which war is required\". The Oscar-nominated screenwriter and director told Sky News: \"I don't think it is possible to make a statement about what war is really like without it being implicitly anti-war, inasmuch as it would be better if this thing did not happen. \"But that's not the same as saying it should never happen. There are circumstances in which war is required.\" His latest film, Warfare, embeds the audience within a platoon of American Navy SEALs on an Iraqi surveillance mission gone wrong, telling the story solely through the memories of war veterans from a real 2006 mission in Ramadi, Iraq. Garland says the film is \"anti-war in as much as it is better if war does not happen,\" adding, \"and that is about the most obvious statement about life on this planet that one could make.\" Comparing it to ongoing geopolitical conflict across the world, Garland goes on: \"It would be better if Gaza had not been flattened. It would be better if Ukraine was not invaded. It would it better if all people's problems could be solved via dialogue and not threat or violenceâ¦ \"To be anti-war to me is a rational position, and most veterans I've met are anti-war.\" The screenwriter behind hits including Ex Machina, 28 Days Later and The Beach says this film is \"an attempt to recreate something as faithfully and accurately as we could\". 'War veterans feel invisible and forgotten' Almost entirely based on first-person accounts, the 15-rated film opens with soldiers singing along to the video of Swedish dance hit Call On Me - complete with gyrating women in thong leotards. It's the only music in the film. The remaining score is made up of explosions, sniper fire and screams of pain. Garland co-wrote and co-directed the film alongside Hollywood stuntman and gunfight coordinator Ray Mendoza, whom Garland met on his last film, Civil War. Mendoza, a communications officer on the fateful mission portrayed in the film, says despite the traumatic content, the experience of making the film was \"therapeutic\". Mendoza told Sky News: \"It actually mended a lot of relationshipsâ¦ There were some guys I hadn't spoken to in a very long time. And this allowed us to bury the hatchet, so to speak, on some issues from that day.\" Turning to Hollywood after serving in the Navy for 16 years, Mendoza says past war film he'd seen - even the good ones - were \"a little off\" because they \"don't get the culture right\". Mendoza admits: \"You feel like no one cares because they didn't get it right. You feel invisible. You feel forgotten.\" With screenings of Warfare shown to around 1,000 veterans ahead of general release, Mendoza says: \"They finally feel heard. They finally feel like somebody got it right.\" As to whether it could be triggering for some veterans, Mendoza says decisively not: \"It's not triggering. I would say it's the opposite, for a veteran at least.\" Read more from Sky News:How attack on aid workers unfoldedThe gang war engulfing Scottish cities 'I'm an actor - I love my hair' A tense and raw 90-minute story told in real time, the film's ensemble cast is made up of young buzzy actors, dubbed \"all of the internet's boyfriends\" when the casting was first announced. Mirroring the Navy SEALs they were portraying, the cast initially bonded through a three-week bootcamp ahead of filming, before living together for the 25-day shoot. Black Mirror's Will Poulter, who plays Eric, the officer in charge of the operation, says the film's extended takes and 360-degree sets demanded a special kind of focus. Poulter said: \"It required everyone to practise something that is fundamental to Navy SEAL mentality - you're a teammate before you're an individual. \"When a camera's roaming around like that and could capture anyone at kind of any moment, it requires that everyone to be 'on' at all times and for the sake of each other. \"It becomes less about making sure that you're performing when the camera lands on you, but as much about this idea that you are performing for the sake of the actor opposite you when the camera's on them.\" Another of the film's stars, Reservation Dogs' D'Pharaoh Woon-A-Tai, plays Mendoza and is the heart of the film. Woon-A-Tai says the cast drew on tactics used by real soldiers to help with the intense filming schedule: \"Laughter is medicineâ¦ A lot of times these are long takes, long hours, back-to-back days, so uplifting our spirit was definitely a big part of it.\" He also joked that shaving each other's heads in a bonding ritual the night before the first day of filming was a daunting task. \"As actors, we love our hair. I mean, I speak personally, I love my hair. You know, I had really long hair. So yeah, it definitely takes a lot of trust. And you know, it wasn't even at all, but you know it was still fun to do.\" Warfare is in cinemas now."

        "Content": "A man hijacked a small plane in the Central American nation of Belize and stabbed two passengers and a pilot before being shot and killed by one of the stabbed passengers, officials have said. The Tropic Air plane was travelling from Corozal to the popular tourist destination of San Pedro with 14 passengers and two crew members on board when it was hijacked. The Cessna Caravan circled in random directions for nearly two hours and was followed by a police helicopter before it touched down at an airport in the coastal town of Ladyville. Authorities in Belize declared a full emergency when the incident began around 8.30am local time, according to the Belize Airport Concession Company. \"In the face of incomprehensible pressure, our pilot acted with extraordinary courage and calm, guiding the aircraft to a safe landing,\" said Maximillian Greif, the CEO of the airline company. \"His actions were nothing short of heroic.\" The two wounded passengers and pilot were being treated for their injuries at a hospital, officials said. A US State Department spokesperson described the incident as \"horrifying\". The Belize police commissioner, Chester Williams, identified the hijacker as Akinyela Taylor and said he was a US military veteran, but US officials did not confirm that detail. One of the stabbed passengers was licensed to carry a firearm and shot and killed Taylor, the commissioner said. He was stabbed in the back and suffered a puncture to his lungs and remains in critical condition. \"We are praying for him,\" Mr Williams said. \"He's our hero.\" Read more from Sky News:Gang war gripping major citiesTrump teases date for second UK state visitZelenskyy says minerals deal getting closer He said Taylor was demanding to be flown out of the country, possibly to Mexico, and at one point wanted the plane to land to take on more fuel. A US Embassy spokesperson in Belize said Taylor also insisted he be taken to the US, adding: \"We don't know why he wanted to go back to the United States.\" US officials said they do not know Taylor's motive for the hijacking but were working with authorities in Belize to discover what happened."

The Child Influencer Project, which has curated the world's first industry guidelines for the group, has warned of a \"large gap in UK law\" which is not sufficiently filled by new online safety legislation. The group's research found that child influencers could be exposed to as many as 20 different risks of harm, including to dignity, identity, family life, education, and their health and safety. Ms Onwurah told Sky News there needs to be a \"much clearer understanding of the nature of child influencers 'work' and the legal and regulatory framework around it\". She said: \"The safety and welfare of children are at the heart of the Online Safety Act and rightly so. \"However, as we know in a number of areas the act may already be obsolete or inadequate due to the lack of foresight and rigour of the last government.\" Victoria Collins, the Liberal Democrat spokesperson for science, innovation and technology, agreed that regulations \"need to keep pace with the times\", with child influencers on social media \"protected in the same way\" as child actors or models. \"Liberal Democrats would welcome steps to strengthen the Online Safety Act on this front,\" she added. 'Something has to be done' MPs warned in 2022 that the government should \"urgently address the gap in UK child labour and performance regulation that is leaving child influencers without protection\". They asked for new laws on working hours and conditions, a mandate for the protection of the child's earnings, a right to erasure and to bring child labour arrangements under the oversight of local authorities. However, Dr Francis Rees, the principal investigator for the Child Influencer Project, told Sky News that even after the implementation of the Online Safety Act, \"there's still a lot wanting\". \"Something has to be done to make brands more aware of their own duty of care towards kids in this arena,\" she said. Dr Rees added that achieving performances from children on social media \"can involve extremely coercive and disruptive practices\". \"We simply have to do more to protect these children who have very little say or understanding of what is really happening. Most are left without a voice and without a choice.\" A child influencer is a person under the age of 18 who makes money through social media, whether that is using their image alone or with their family. Dr Francis Rees, principal investigator for the Child Influencer Project, explains this is an âescalationâ from the sharing of digital images and performances of the child into âsome form of commercial gain or brand endorsementâ.\n She said issues can emerge when young people work with brands - who do not have to comply with standard practise for a child influencer as they would with an in-house production. Dr Rees explains how, when working with a child model or actor, an advertising agency would have to make sure a performance license is in place, and make sure âeverything is in accordance with many layers of legislation and regulation around child protectionâ. But, outside of a professional environment, these safeguards are not in place. She notes that 30-second videos âcan take as long as three days to practice and rehearseâ. And, Dr Rees suggests, this can have a strain on the parent-child relationship. âIt's just not as simple as taking a child on to a set and having them perform to a camera which professionals are involved in.â Read more from Sky News:Four killed as cable car crashes to ground near NaplesTwo dead and five injured in shooting at Florida university The researcher pointed to one particular instance, in which children were advertising an underwear brand on social media. She said: \"The kids in the company's own marketing material or their own media campaigns are either pulling up the band of the underwear underneath their clothing, or they're holding the underwear up while they're fully clothed. \"But whenever you look at any of the sponsored content produced by families with children - mum, dad, and child are in their underwear.\" Dr Rees said it is \"night and day\" in terms of how companies are behaving when they have responsibility for the material, versus \"the lack of responsibility once they hand it over to parents with kids\"."

        "Headline": "Gold is a tangible commodity - a physical good that can be bought and sold. An estimated 3,000 tonnes of gold are mined each year. But why is it going up in value?",
        "Content": "Gold has been reaching record highs of late, with the price of spot gold hitting $3,357.40 (Â£2,532) per ounce for the first time ever on Wednesday. It marked a rise of around $700 (Â£528) this year and comes at a time of significant uncertainty over Donald Trump's tariffs on imports into the US. That is no coincidence. That's because gold is a tangible commodity - a physical good that can be bought and sold. Gold prices fell more than 1% on Thursday after a sharp rise in the previous session as investors booked profits ahead of a long Easter weekend. An estimated 3,000 tonnes are mined each year, with China mining the most gold in 2024, followed by Russia, Canada and the US. And the Bank of England holds the world's second biggest known trove, with roughly 400,000 gold bars worth billions of pounds sitting in its vaults. So why is it going up in value? Gold considered a 'safe haven' The precious metal is known as a \"safe haven\" - an asset that typically retains or increases in value during times of market turbulence or economic uncertainty. Investors typically flock to safe havens to protect their capital from losses when markets are volatile. So it's perhaps no surprise that its value has skyrocketed at a time when markets around the world have been unsettled by the introduction and temporary rolling back of some US tariffs. \"Gold remains heavily supported by a broadly weaker dollar, uncertainty around tariff announcements and fears about a global recession,\" said Lukman Otunuga, senior research analyst at online trading broker FXTM. Singapore-based dealer GoldSilver central managing director Brian Lan added: \"Gold will continue to be strong as long as there's uncertainty.\" Read more:Sainsbury's profits top Â£1bn after closing cafes and cutting jobsWhat you can't now bring into Britain from EU under new rules Gold saw a similar surge at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, but has been on an upward trend for years. Popular investment, but not without risk Those in favour of investing in gold argue it can serve to diversify and balance your investment portfolio, as well as mitigate possible risks down the road. Some also take comfort in buying something tangible that has the potential to increase in value over time, and which isn't directly tied to global currencies. But gold sceptics warn people to be wary. The Commodity Futures Trade Commission has previously warned that precious metals can be highly volatile, and prices rise as demand goes up - meaning \"when economic anxiety or instability is high, the people who typically profit from precious metals are the sellers\". It adds that if you do choose to invest in gold, it's important to educate yourself on safe trading practices and be cautious of potential scams and counterfeits on the market. And while gold being a tangible currency is in many ways seen as a plus, it also means it can run out; and some analysts estimate it will do so in less than three decades.

        "Content": "\n          Scotland correspondent\n              @ConnorGillies\n  It's like The Godfather, one reformed drug trafficker tells me. The mythical gangster film centred on an organised crime dynasty locked in a transfer of power. Communities in Scotland currently have a front row seat to a new war of violence, torture, and taunts as feuding drug lords and notorious families grapple for control of Glasgow and Edinburgh. There have been more than a dozen brutal attacks over the past six weeks - ranging from fire bombings to attacks on children and gun violence. Victims left for dead, businesses up in flames Gangsters have filmed themselves setting fire to buildings and homes connected to the associates and relatives of their bitter rivals. The main aim, they boast, is to \"exterminate\" the opposition. The taunting footage, accompanied by the song Keep On Running by The Spencer Davis Group, has been plastered over social media as part of a deliberate game of goading. A 12-year-old boy and 72-year-old woman were left for dead when teenagers wearing balaclavas burst into a home in north Glasgow. Garages and businesses have gone up in flames. Shots were fired at an Edinburgh house. Signals are being sent of who wants control of Scotland's dark criminal underworld. What's caused the gang war? The former director of the Scottish Crime and Drug Enforcement Agency, Graeme Pearson, explains how a \"vacuum of leadership\" is playing a part. Last October, Glasgow-based cocaine kingpin Jamie Stevenson, known as The Iceman, was jailed after orchestrating a Â£100m cocaine shipment stashed in banana boxes from South America. The mob leader was one of Britain's most wanted, running his business like another on-screen criminal enterprise: The Sopranos. The 59-year-old fugitive went on the run before eventually being hunted and apprehended by police while out jogging in the Netherlands. 'Old scores to settle' But paranoia was running rife about how this notorious gangster could be brought down. Was there a grass? Was it one of their own? It further fuelled divisions and forced new alliances to be forged across Scotland's organised criminal networks. It wasn't until The Iceman case came to court that it was revealed an encrypted messaging platform, known as EncroChat, had been infiltrated by law enforcement. It ultimately led to Stevenson pleading guilty. Ex-senior drug enforcement officer Mr Pearson told Sky News: \"It is a complex picture because you have got people who are in prison who still want to have influence outside and look after what was their business. \"On the outside you've got wannabes who are coming forward, and they think this is an opportunity for them, and you have got others have old scores to settle that they could not settle when crime bosses were around.\" Read more from Sky News:Scientists find strongest evidence yet of aliensWidow has 'no regrets' over helping husband's suicide Mr Pearson describes a toxic mix swirling to create outbursts of violence unfolding in Scotland. He concluded: \"All that mixes together - and the greed for the money that comes from drugs, and from the kudos that comes from being a 'main man', and you end up with competition, violence, and the kind of incidents we have seen over the past four to six weeks.\" New wave of violence 'barbaric' Glasgow man Mark Dempster is a former addict, dealer, and drug smuggler who is now an author and respected counsellor helping people quit drinking and drugs. He describes the \"jostle for power\" as not a new concept among Glasgow's high profile gangland families. \"There is always going to be someone new who wants to control the markets. It is like The Godfather. There is no difference between Scotland, Albania, or India,\" he said. Mr Dempster suggests a shift in tactics in Glasgow and Edinburgh in recent weeks, with 12-year-olds being viciously attacked in the middle of the night. \"It is barbaric. When young people, children, get pulled into the cross fire. It takes it to a different level. \"At least with the old mafiosa they had an unwritten rule that no children, no other family members. You would deal directly with the main people that were your opposition.\" Police Scotland is racing to get control of the situation, but declined to speak to Sky News about its ongoing operation. It has been suggested 100 officers are working on this case, with \"arrests imminent\". But this is at the very sharp end of sophisticated criminal empires where the police are not feared, there are fierce vendettas and, clearly, power is up for grabs."

The force said it is introducing an \"interim position\" while it digests the Supreme Court's decision that the definition of a \"woman\" under the Equality Act 2010 refers to \"a biological woman and biological sex\". A British Transport Police (BTP) Authority spokesman told Sky News: \"Under previous policy, we had advised that someone with a gender recognition certificate (GRC) may be searched in accordance with their acquired sex. \"However, as an interim position while we digest today's judgment, we have advised our officers that any same sex searches in custody are to be undertaken in accordance with the biological birth sex of the detainee.\" Politics latest: Badenoch responds to Jenrick WhatsApp mishap In September last year, BTP, which is responsible for policing the UK's railways and similar transport systems, published its \"position\" on transgender and non-binary officers carrying out strip searches. It said officers would \"only be able to search persons of the same sex on their birth or gender recognition certificate (GRC). Officers who identified as another gender but who did not have a GRC were not allowed to, but if a trans woman had a certificate, they could strip search a female detainee.  Strip searches involve the removal of more than a jacket, outer coat, gloves, headwear and footwear. They \"expose buttocks, genitalia and (female) breasts\", the BTP guidance says. The Sex Matters campaign applied for a judicial review of that guidance with the High Court in December. It said the policy \"puts detainees at risk of sexual harassment and sexual assault\", and said it was a violation of Article 3 of the European Convention on Human Rights, which protects against torture and inhuman or degrading treatment. Sex Matters said the policy \"also puts female officers in a humiliating and dangerous position, as they may be pressured to search trans-identified men\".

She said: \"Obviously, public bodies have been asked to look at their own guidance. \"And we will do that very, very carefully.\" But she warned against public bodies making statements \"that may alarm people\", telling them to take their time to look at their guidance. Baroness Kishwer Falkner, chair of the UK's Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC), said the ruling means there is \"no confusion\" now. She said the NHS will \"have to change\" its 2019 policy, which says transgender patients are entitled to be accommodated on single-sex wards matching how they identify."

        "Content": " The chief executive of Toby Carvery has apologised for \"all the upset that it has caused\" after it felled a 400-year-old oak tree outside one of its restaurants. The tree, in Whitewebbs Park, north London, on the border of a restaurant car park, had its branches cut off on 3 April after the company's owner, Mitchells & Butlers, said specialists had advised that it was \"a potential health and safety risk\". However, an Enfield Council boss claimed its own team of experts had checked the tree in December and found it was \"healthy and posed no risk to the neighbouring car park and its users\". The remains of the trunk, surrounded by its severed branches, were discovered by council workers on 3 April. Now, Mitchells & Butlers chief executive Phil Urban has written to residents saying the company had \"acted in good faith\" when it greenlit the work. He said: \"Clearly the felling of a beautiful old tree is a very emotive subject and is not something that any of us would undertake lightly. \"I can only apologise for all the upset that it has caused.\" \n                  More giant redwoods in UK than in native US, study says\n                 \n                  Ancient rainforest to be restored in Devon, with 100,000 trees planted this winter\n                 \n                  Bromley Council orders landowner to replant felled oak trees on 'much loved, mini woodland site'\n                 Mr Urban claimed penalties for failing to \"act on all health & safety issues\" were \"too great to contemplate\", which is why the company's internal processes allowed work like the tree-felling to be \"fast-tracked\". He added that the company accepted it needed to \"tighten our protocols\" to prevent a repeat of the events in Enfield. \"We cannot undo what has been done,\" he said. \"On a personal level, I am very sorry for all the anger and upset that this incident has caused.\" Enfield Council previously reported the incident to the Metropolitan Police and said it was treating it as criminal damage.

        "Content": "\n          Scotland reporter\n              @Jenster13\n A sales manager from West Yorkshire has been jailed for a spate of offences - including multiple rapes - that he committed while living in Scotland. James McCall, 49, preyed on two women during a period of offending spanning 12 years between 2007 and 2019. The Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service (COPFS) said his criminal behaviour included sexually assaulting his victims while they were asleep and unable to give consent. Judge Lord Colbeck told the accused: \"Each of the charges of rape involved a complainer who was incapable of giving or withholding consent. \"You took advantage of them in the most appalling manner imaginable.\" The judge described the victim impact statements as \"truly harrowing reading\". He added: \"It is clear that your offending behaviour has occasioned each of them what might properly be described as severe psychological harm or trauma. \n                  The Godfather-style gang war gripping two major cities - with brutal attacks caught on camera\n                 \n                  Woman, 72, and boy, 12, seriously assaulted during home invasion 'linked to ongoing Edinburgh-Glasgow gang feud'\n                 \n                  'Devoted daughter' avoids prison after 'mercy killing' of terminally ill father\n                 \"That has had a significant effect upon them both and will continue to do so.\" McCall, from Pudsey in Leeds, denied any wrongdoing but was last month found guilty of nine charges following a trial at the High Court in Glasgow. He was convicted of two counts of assault, two counts of threatening or abusive behaviour, four counts of rape, and a single count of abusive behaviour towards a partner or ex-partner. McCall returned to the dock on Wednesday and was handed a 17-year extended sentence, with 12 years in jail and five years on licence once released back into the community. Lord Colbeck highlighted a criminal justice social work report which reported McCall had shown \"no insight\" into his offending behaviour. The judge said: \"You continue to deny any meaningful responsibility for the offences of which you have been convicted and minimise the severity of such conduct as you do now accept. \"You attribute blame to each of your victims.\" McCall was additionally added to the sex offenders' register indefinitely and banned from contacting his victims.

Because of them, our expert prosecutors were able to ensure McCall has faced the consequences of his vile offending.\" Detective Inspector Gary Smillie also praised the women's bravery. He said: \"McCall is an abusive individual who has shown no remorse for his violent and abusive actions. \"His offending had a profound effect on the victims and I would like to commend them for their strength in coming forward and during the investigation. \"I hope this sentencing goes some way to acknowledge this and brings them some comfort as they move forward in their lives.\""

        "Content": "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has accused US envoy Steve Witkoff of \"spreading Russian narratives\" about the Ukraine war - as he said a much-anticipated minerals deal was moving closer. His comments came as Mr Witkoff was in Paris for talks with Ukrainian and European officials. The diplomat met Vladimir Putin last week and later told Fox News he had held \"compelling\" discussions with the Russian leader.  \"This peace deal is about these so-called five territories, but there's so much more to it,\" he said.  He appeared to be referencing occupied Crimea and the four regions annexed in sham referendums in 2022: Kherson, Luhansk, Donetsk and Zaporizhzhia. The votes were widely condemned and dismissed by the West - and Russia still does not fully control these regions - but Mr Witkoff has been accused of parroting Moscow's line. \n                  Muscles from Brussels Jean-Claude Van Damme sends 'big kiss' to Putin with ambassadorial job request\n                 \n                  Ukrainian forces 'strike Russian brigade' behind deadly missile attack on Sumy\n                 \n                  Russian journalists accused of working with Alexei Navalny jailed for more than five years each\n                 Mr Zelenskyy, speaking at a news conference, also said a \"memorandum of intent\" on a minerals deal with the US could be signed online on Thursday. However, speaking at the White House later - where he was hosting the Italian prime minister, US President Donald Trump said it was likely to be next week. The deal was expected to be done weeks ago but was derailed by the Ukrainian leader's falling out at the White House. President Trump wants to share in profits from Ukraine's natural resources in what he says is repayment for military aid. It's hoped America having a stake in the country could also help maintain any truce. In his media conference, Mr Zelenskyy also claimed he had evidence of China helping Russia with artillery. \"We believe that Chinese representatives are engaged in the production of some weapons on the territory of Russia,\" the Ukrainian leader said. He did not specify whether he meant artillery systems or shells. It comes after Ukraine said recently that it had captured two Chinese citizens fighting in the east of the country. US efforts to broker a ceasefire have so far failed to provide a breakthrough, with critics accusing Russia of stalling and not really wanting peace.  President Trump was asked on Thursday how long Mr Putin had to respond to his ceasefire proposal before facing either tariffs or more sanctions. \"We're going to be hearing from them this week, very shortly, actually,\" he told reporters. He also said that while he does not hold President Zelenskyy responsible for the war, he is \"not a big fan\". \"I'm not happy with him, and I'm not happy with anybody involved,\" he said. \"I'm not blaming him, but what I am saying is that I wouldn't say he's done the greatest job. Okay? I'm not a big fan.\" Three killed in drone attack US envoy Mr Witkoff was joined in Paris earlier by US secretary of state Marco Rubio. The men held talks with French, British and German representatives - the so-called \"coalition of the willing\" who could provide security guarantees in the event of a ceasefire. Ukraine's presidential chief of staff, foreign minister and defence minister were also there and a follow-up is scheduled for next week in London.  While a total ceasefire has proved elusive, a 30-day moratorium on striking energy infrastructure targets was previously agreed. However, both sides have accused each other of breaking the agreement. Russian government spokeswoman Maria Zakharova claimed on Thursday that Ukraine had breached it 80 times. President Zelenskyy, meanwhile, said Russian energy attacks had decreased but that it was attacking civilian infrastructures instead. Three people, including a child, were killed overnight in a drone attack on Ukraine's southeastern city of Dnipro, according to officials, with 30 wounded. Local authorities said widespread damage was caused to civilian infrastructure, including an educational institution, residential buildings, a gym and a dormitory. It comes after at least 35 people died in a Russian missile strike on Sumy at the weekend."

Italy's search and rescue said it was responding to the accident at Monte Faito in the town of Castellammare di Stabia. The cable car accident took place just a week after the destination reopened for the season. It is popular for its views of Mount Vesuvius and the Bay of Naples. In 2021, 14 people died in Italy when a cable car linking the northern Lake Maggiore with a nearby mountain plunged to the ground."

The Tropic Air plane was travelling from Corozal to the popular tourist destination of San Pedro with 14 passengers and two crew members on board when it was hijacked. The Cessna Caravan circled in random directions for nearly two hours and was followed by a police helicopter before it touched down at an airport in the coastal town of Ladyville. Authorities in Belize declared a full emergency when the incident began around 8.30am local time, according to the Belize Airport Concession Company. \"In the face of incomprehensible pressure, our pilot acted with extraordinary courage and calm, guiding the aircraft to a safe landing,\" said Maximillian Greif, the CEO of the airline company. \"His actions were nothing short of heroic.\" The two wounded passengers and pilot were being treated for their injuries at a hospital, officials said. A US State Department spokesperson described the incident as \"horrifying\". The Belize police commissioner, Chester Williams, identified the hijacker as Akinyela Taylor and said he was a US military veteran, but US officials did not confirm that detail. One of the stabbed passengers was licensed to carry a firearm and shot and killed Taylor, the commissioner said. He was stabbed in the back and suffered a puncture to his lungs and remains in critical condition. \"We are praying for him,\" Mr Williams said. \"He's our hero.\" Read more from Sky News:Gang war gripping major citiesTrump teases date for second UK state visitZelenskyy says minerals deal getting closer He said Taylor was demanding to be flown out of the country, possibly to Mexico, and at one point wanted the plane to land to take on more fuel.

Pictures were published of their funeral on Thursday, showing their bodies, covered in sheets and wrapped in bags, lying on the ground surrounded by mourners.  They had all suffered severe burns, the Nasser Hospital, which received the bodies, said. Nine children were among 13 people killed by other Israeli strikes in northern Gaza, according to Gaza's Indonesian Hospital. Israel's military says it tries to avoid harming civilians and blames their deaths on Hamas because it operates in residential areas. There was no immediate comment on the latest strikes. 'Most people in Gaza down to one meal a day' The latest reported casualties of the conflict come as the humanitarian crisis there worsens. The UN warned that almost all of Gaza's population of over two million is relying on the one million prepared meals produced daily by charity kitchens. The only other way to get food in Gaza is from markets, but rising prices make them unaffordable for most and the World Food Programme called it Gaza's \"worst humanitarian crisis\" since the escalation of hostilities in October 2023. Hani Almadhoun, co-founder of Gaza Soup Kitchen, said they have food for about three more weeks, but only pasta, rice, and canned meat... and \"no fresh produce\". Most people in Gaza are now down to one meal a day, according to Shaina Low, a spokesperson for the Norwegian Refugee Council, which she called \"far lower than what is needed\". Palestinians are also surviving on six or seven litres of water a day, local official Omar Shatat said, often collected after queuing in long lines to fill jerry cans from trucks. It's a good deal less than what the UN estimates is needed for basic needs. Israeli defence minister Israel Katz said on Wednesday that preventing humanitarian aid is one of the \"central pressure tactics\" used against Hamas, which Israel accuses of siphoning off aid to maintain its rule. Israel is demanding that Hamas release more hostages at the start of any new ceasefire and ultimately agrees to disarm and leave the territory. Hamas is currently holding 59 hostages, 24 of whom are believed to be alive. It says it will only return them in exchange for the release of more Palestinian prisoners, a full Israeli withdrawal from Gaza and a lasting truce, as called for in the now-defunct ceasefire agreement reached earlier this year. The war began when Hamas-led militants attacked southern Israel on 7 October 2023, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducting 251 people. Most of the hostages have since been released. Read more:Israeli troops will 'remain in Gaza'Trapped Gazans 'dying under rubble'A timeline of events since the 7 October attacks Israel's retaliatory offensive has killed more than 51,000 Palestinians, mostly women and children, according to the Gaza Health Ministry, which does not say how many of the dead were civilians or militants. Israel says it has killed around 20,000 militants, without providing evidence. The war has destroyed vast parts of Gaza and most of its food production capabilities and displaced around 90% of the population, with hundreds of thousands of people living in tent camps and bombed-out buildings."

There will be \"notable\" markdowns to growth forecasts, according to the financial organisation's managing director Kristalina Georgieva in her curtain raiser speech at the IMF's spring meeting in Washington. Some nations will also see higher inflation as a result of the taxes Mr Trump has placed on imports to the US. At the same time, the European Central Bank said it anticipated less inflation from tariffs. Money: Chef on a classic he'll never order  Earlier this month, a flat rate of 10% was placed on all imports, while additional levies from certain countries were paused for 90 days. Car parts, steel and aluminium are, however, still subject to a 25% tax when they arrive in the US. This has meant the \"reboot of the global trading system\", Ms Georgieva said. \"Trade policy uncertainty is literally off the charts.\" The confusion over why nations were slapped with their specific tariffs, the stop-start nature of the taxes, and the rapid escalation of the tit-for-tat levies between the US and China sparked uncertainty and financial market turbulence. \n                  US markets fall as AI chipmakers mourn new restrictions on China exports\n                 \n                  China's economy surges, but tariffs effect is yet to be seen\n                 \n                  White House looking at trade deals from more than 15 countries \n                 \"The longer uncertainty persists, the larger the cost,\" Ms Georgieva cautioned. \"Unusual\" activity in currency and government debt markets - as investors sold off dollars and US government debt - \"should be taken as a warning\", she added. \"Everyone suffers if financial conditions worsen.\" Read more:Sainsburys profits top Â£1bn after closing all cafes and cutting 3,000 jobs Predators eye bargain deal for struggling discount retailer Poundland These challenges are being borne out from a \"weaker starting position\" as public debt levels are much higher in recent years due to spending during the COVID-19 pandemic and higher interest rates, which increased the cost of borrowing. The trade tensions are \"to a large extent\" a result of \"an erosion of trust\", Ms Georgieva said. This erosion, coupled with jobs moving overseas, and concerns over national security and domestic production, has left us in a world where \"industry gets more attention than the service sector\" and \"where national interests tower over global concerns,\" she added."

Press Secretary Karoline Levitt had flagged the briefing \"with a special guest\" two hours earlier. Afterwards, she invited questions from journalists in the room and then refused to take any.  By drawing a direct connection between this crime and immigration policy, the administration was framing deportations as necessary to protect American lives. Even the deportation of Kimar Albrega Garcia, who they admit was sent to a notorious prison in El Salvador due to \"administrative error\". Leveraging a mother's tragic story to justify the removal of Garcia disregards the context, such as his lack of criminal conviction. The Supreme Court has ordered the US government to facilitate his return, but the White House says it is not compelled to do so.

And Patty Morin's unthinkable loss is a compelling reminder that justice matters."

        "Content": "Power has been returned to just over 40% of Puerto Rico following an island-wide blackout on Wednesday, the territory's energy distributor has said. The loss of power affected the main international airport, several hospitals and hotels filled with Easter holidaymakers. The blackout also worsened traffic, forced hundreds of businesses to close and left those unable to afford generators scrambling to buy ice and candles. It was not immediately clear what caused the shutdown. The outage hit shortly after noon local time (5pm UK time) on Wednesday and left 1.4 million customers without electricity and 328,000 without water. Crews have been working to restore electricity and at least 175,000 customers, or 12%, had power back at the end of Wednesday. Luma Energy, which provides power to the whole of Puerto Rico, said in a post on X that power had been restored for around 609,711 customers - representing 41.5% of its total customer base - as of 7am local time (12pm UK time). \n                  Donald Trump rally: Comedian Tony Hinchcliffe under fire after labelling Puerto Rico 'floating island of garbage'\n                 \n                  Pregnant woman airlifted from Disney cruise ship\n                 \n                  Kamar de los Reyes: Call Of Duty and One Life To Live star, dies aged 56 in Los Angeles after battle with cancer\n                 Meanwhile, officials expect 90% of customers to have power back within 48 to 72 hours of the outage. The outage marks the second island-wide blackout to hit Puerto Rico in less than four months, with the previous one occurring on New Year's Eve. The roar of generators and smell of fumes filled the air as a growing number of Puerto Ricans renewed calls for the government to cancel its contracts with Luma Energy and Genera PR, which oversees the generation of power on the island. Jenniffer Gonzalez, the governor of Puerto Rico, promised to heed those calls. Ms Gonzalez, who cut her holiday short and returned to Puerto Rico following Wednesday's blackout, said: \"That is not under doubt or question... It is unacceptable that we have failures of this kind.\" Read more world news:Israeli strike 'kills family of 10'Senior Chinese underworld figure shot dead in RomeWhy Trump is leveraging story of murdered woman Ms Gonzalez said a major outage like the one that occurred on Wednesday leads to an estimated daily revenue loss of $230m (Â£174m). Ramon C BarquÃ­n III, president of the United Retail Center, a non-profit organisation that represents small and medium-sized businesses, warned that ongoing outages would spook potential investors at a time that Puerto Rico urgently needs economic development. \"We cannot continue to repeat this cycle of blackouts without taking concrete measures to strengthen our energy infrastructure,\" he said. Many were concerned about Puerto Rico's elderly population, with the mayor of the town of Canovanas deploying brigades to visit the bedridden and those who depend on electronic medical equipment. Meanwhile, the mayor of Vega Alta municipality opened a centre to provide power to those with lifesaving medical equipment. Daniel Hernandez, vice president of operations at Genera PR, said on Wednesday that a disturbance hit the transmission system shortly after noon, a time when the grid is vulnerable because there are few machines regulating frequency at that hour. Puerto Rico has struggled with chronic outages since September 2017 when Hurricane Maria pummelled the island as a powerful Category 4 storm, razing a power grid that crews are still struggling to rebuild.The grid had already been deteriorating as a result of decades of a lack of maintenance and investment."

Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer handed over an invitation from the King when he visited Washington in February. Trump teases return to UK - latest updates Buckingham Palace previously only said the visit would happen \"when diaries allow\", but Mr Trump told reporters on Thursday: \"I think they are setting a date for September.\" \"I don't know how it can be bigger than the last one,\" he said. \"The last one was incredible, but they say the next one will be even more important.\" Mr Trump will become the only elected political leader in modern times to be invited to two state visits by a British monarch. The president called the UK a \"great country\" in his comments at the White House on Thursday and said it was \"an honour to be a friend of King Charles and the family, William\". His first state visit was in 2019, when he was hosted by the late Queen.

One person is in custody in connection with the attack at Florida State University's (FSU) campus in Tallahassee, a spokesperson for the local police department said. The suspect, named by police as Phoenix Ikner, was said to be a current student at FSU and the 20-year-old son of a Leon County sheriff deputy. The attacker, who was believed to have close ties to the local force, was in hospital after being shot by officers. In a news conference, Leon County Sheriff Walt McNeil said the gunman had access to his mother's weapons and she had been one of Mr McNeil's sheriffs. One of her weapons was found at the scene, but it wasn't clear if it had been used.

Ambulances, fire trucks and police vehicles raced to the campus around midday local time (5pm UK time) on Thursday. As students streamed away from the area of the student union in their hundreds, some were visibly emotional and others were glued to their phones. Dozens later gathered near the university's music school, waiting for news. 'In that moment, it was survival' Students told Sky's US partner network NBC News that the attacker drove to a road near the student union, before getting out of a vehicle with a rifle, and later going back for a pistol, just before midday. Ryan Cedergren, 21, said he and 30 others hid in the bowling alley in the lower level of the student union after seeing others running from a nearby bar. \"In that moment, it was survival,\" he said. Another student, Daniella Streety, told NBC News of the chaos that unfolded at the scene. She remained on lockdown in a campus building and said: \"I did see them carry out one student in what looked like on a stretcher and kept them in the road until an ambulance was able to pick them up.\" Joshua Sirmans, 20, was in the university's main library when he said alarms began going off warning of an active shooter. Police escorted him and other students out of the library with their hands over their heads, he said.

The Tropic Air plane was travelling from Corozal to the popular tourist destination of San Pedro with 14 passengers and two crew members on board when it was hijacked. The Cessna Caravan circled in random directions for nearly two hours and was followed by a police helicopter before it touched down at an airport in the coastal town of Ladyville. Authorities in Belize declared a full emergency when the incident began around 8.30am local time, according to the Belize Airport Concession Company. \"In the face of incomprehensible pressure, our pilot acted with extraordinary courage and calm, guiding the aircraft to a safe landing,\" said Maximillian Greif, the CEO of the airline company. \"His actions were nothing short of heroic.\" The two wounded passengers and pilot were being treated for their injuries at a hospital, officials said. A US State Department spokesperson described the incident as \"horrifying\". The Belize police commissioner, Chester Williams, identified the hijacker as Akinyela Taylor and said he was a US military veteran, but US officials did not confirm that detail. One of the stabbed passengers was licensed to carry a firearm and shot and killed Taylor, the commissioner said. He was stabbed in the back and suffered a puncture to his lungs and remains in critical condition. \"We are praying for him,\" Mr Williams said. \"He's our hero.\" Read more from Sky News:Gang war gripping major citiesTrump teases date for second UK state visitZelenskyy says minerals deal getting closer He said Taylor was demanding to be flown out of the country, possibly to Mexico, and at one point wanted the plane to land to take on more fuel.

There will be \"notable\" markdowns to growth forecasts, according to the financial organisation's managing director Kristalina Georgieva in her curtain raiser speech at the IMF's spring meeting in Washington. Some nations will also see higher inflation as a result of the taxes Mr Trump has placed on imports to the US. At the same time, the European Central Bank said it anticipated less inflation from tariffs. Money: Chef on a classic he'll never order  Earlier this month, a flat rate of 10% was placed on all imports, while additional levies from certain countries were paused for 90 days. Car parts, steel and aluminium are, however, still subject to a 25% tax when they arrive in the US. This has meant the \"reboot of the global trading system\", Ms Georgieva said. \"Trade policy uncertainty is literally off the charts.\" The confusion over why nations were slapped with their specific tariffs, the stop-start nature of the taxes, and the rapid escalation of the tit-for-tat levies between the US and China sparked uncertainty and financial market turbulence. \n                  US markets fall as AI chipmakers mourn new restrictions on China exports\n                 \n                  China's economy surges, but tariffs effect is yet to be seen\n                 \n                  White House looking at trade deals from more than 15 countries \n                 \"The longer uncertainty persists, the larger the cost,\" Ms Georgieva cautioned. \"Unusual\" activity in currency and government debt markets - as investors sold off dollars and US government debt - \"should be taken as a warning\", she added. \"Everyone suffers if financial conditions worsen.\" Read more:Sainsburys profits top Â£1bn after closing all cafes and cutting 3,000 jobs Predators eye bargain deal for struggling discount retailer Poundland These challenges are being borne out from a \"weaker starting position\" as public debt levels are much higher in recent years due to spending during the COVID-19 pandemic and higher interest rates, which increased the cost of borrowing. The trade tensions are \"to a large extent\" a result of \"an erosion of trust\", Ms Georgieva said. This erosion, coupled with jobs moving overseas, and concerns over national security and domestic production, has left us in a world where \"industry gets more attention than the service sector\" and \"where national interests tower over global concerns,\" she added."

The supermarket chain reported that sales and profits grew over the year to March. It also comes after Sainsbury's announced in January plans to close of all of its in-store cafes and the loss of 3,000 jobs. But the high profits are not expected to increase, according to Sainsbury's, which warned of heightened competition as a supermarket price war heats up. Tesco too warned of \"intensification of competition\" last week, as Asda's executive chairman earlier this year committed to foregoing profits in favour of price cuts. Sainsbury's said it had spent Â£1bn lowering prices, leading to a \"record-breaking year in grocery\", its highest market share gain in more than a decade, as more people chose Sainsbury's for their main shop. Money: Chef on a classic he'll never order It's the second most popular supermarket with market share of ahead of Asda but below Tesco, according to latest industry figures from market research company Kantar. In the same year, the supermarket announced plans to cut more than 3,000 jobs and the closure of its remaining 61 in-store cafes as well as hot food, patisserie, and pizza counters, to save money in a \"challenging cost environment\". This financial year, profits are forecast to be around Â£1bn again, in line with the Â£1.036bn in retail underlying operating profit announced today for the year ended in March. The grocer has been a vocal critic of the government's increase in employer national insurance contributions and said in January it would incur an additional Â£140m as a result of the hike. Higher national insurance bills are not captured by the annual results published on Thursday, as they only took effect in April, outside of the 2024 to 2025 financial year. Supermarkets gearing up for a price war and not bulking profits further could be good news for prices of shelves, according to online investment planner AJ Bell's investment director Russ Mould. \"The main winners in a price war would ultimately be shoppers\", he said. \"Like Tesco, Sainsbury's wants to equip itself to protect its competitive position, hence its guidance for flat profit in the coming year as it looks to offer customers value for money.\" There has been, however, a warning from Sainsbury's that higher national insurance contributions will bring costs up for consumers. News shops are planned in \"key target locations\", Sainsbury's results said, which, along with further openings, \"provides a unique opportunity to drive further market share gains\"."

        "Content": "Gold has been reaching record highs of late, with the price of spot gold hitting $3,357.40 (Â£2,532) per ounce for the first time ever on Wednesday. It marked a rise of around $700 (Â£528) this year and comes at a time of significant uncertainty over Donald Trump's tariffs on imports into the US. That is no coincidence. That's because gold is a tangible commodity - a physical good that can be bought and sold. Gold prices fell more than 1% on Thursday after a sharp rise in the previous session as investors booked profits ahead of a long Easter weekend. An estimated 3,000 tonnes are mined each year, with China mining the most gold in 2024, followed by Russia, Canada and the US. And the Bank of England holds the world's second biggest known trove, with roughly 400,000 gold bars worth billions of pounds sitting in its vaults. So why is it going up in value? Gold considered a 'safe haven' The precious metal is known as a \"safe haven\" - an asset that typically retains or increases in value during times of market turbulence or economic uncertainty. Investors typically flock to safe havens to protect their capital from losses when markets are volatile. So it's perhaps no surprise that its value has skyrocketed at a time when markets around the world have been unsettled by the introduction and temporary rolling back of some US tariffs. \"Gold remains heavily supported by a broadly weaker dollar, uncertainty around tariff announcements and fears about a global recession,\" said Lukman Otunuga, senior research analyst at online trading broker FXTM. Singapore-based dealer GoldSilver central managing director Brian Lan added: \"Gold will continue to be strong as long as there's uncertainty.\" Read more:Sainsbury's profits top Â£1bn after closing cafes and cutting jobsWhat you can't now bring into Britain from EU under new rules Gold saw a similar surge at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, but has been on an upward trend for years. Popular investment, but not without risk Those in favour of investing in gold argue it can serve to diversify and balance your investment portfolio, as well as mitigate possible risks down the road. Some also take comfort in buying something tangible that has the potential to increase in value over time, and which isn't directly tied to global currencies. But gold sceptics warn people to be wary. The Commodity Futures Trade Commission has previously warned that precious metals can be highly volatile, and prices rise as demand goes up - meaning \"when economic anxiety or instability is high, the people who typically profit from precious metals are the sellers\". It adds that if you do choose to invest in gold, it's important to educate yourself on safe trading practices and be cautious of potential scams and counterfeits on the market. And while gold being a tangible currency is in many ways seen as a plus, it also means it can run out; and some analysts estimate it will do so in less than three decades.

Chi Onwurah, chair of the science, technology and innovation committee, said parts of the Online Safety Act - passed in October 2023 - may already be \"obsolete or inadequate\". Politics latest: Follow live updates Experts have raised concerns that there is a lack of provision in industry laws for children who earn money through brand collaborations on social media when compared to child actors and models. This has led to some children advertising in their underwear on social media, one expert has claimed. Those working in more traditional entertainment fields are safeguarded by performance laws, which strictly govern the hours a minor can work, the money they earn and who they are accompanied by. The Child Influencer Project, which has curated the world's first industry guidelines for the group, has warned of a \"large gap in UK law\" which is not sufficiently filled by new online safety legislation. The group's research found that child influencers could be exposed to as many as 20 different risks of harm, including to dignity, identity, family life, education, and their health and safety. Ms Onwurah told Sky News there needs to be a \"much clearer understanding of the nature of child influencers 'work' and the legal and regulatory framework around it\". She said: \"The safety and welfare of children are at the heart of the Online Safety Act and rightly so. \"However, as we know in a number of areas the act may already be obsolete or inadequate due to the lack of foresight and rigour of the last government.\" Victoria Collins, the Liberal Democrat spokesperson for science, innovation and technology, agreed that regulations \"need to keep pace with the times\", with child influencers on social media \"protected in the same way\" as child actors or models. \"Liberal Democrats would welcome steps to strengthen the Online Safety Act on this front,\" she added. 'Something has to be done' MPs warned in 2022 that the government should \"urgently address the gap in UK child labour and performance regulation that is leaving child influencers without protection\". They asked for new laws on working hours and conditions, a mandate for the protection of the child's earnings, a right to erasure and to bring child labour arrangements under the oversight of local authorities. However, Dr Francis Rees, the principal investigator for the Child Influencer Project, told Sky News that even after the implementation of the Online Safety Act, \"there's still a lot wanting\". \"Something has to be done to make brands more aware of their own duty of care towards kids in this arena,\" she said. Dr Rees added that achieving performances from children on social media \"can involve extremely coercive and disruptive practices\". \"We simply have to do more to protect these children who have very little say or understanding of what is really happening. Most are left without a voice and without a choice.\" A child influencer is a person under the age of 18 who makes money through social media, whether that is using their image alone or with their family. Dr Francis Rees, principal investigator for the Child Influencer Project, explains this is an âescalationâ from the sharing of digital images and performances of the child into âsome form of commercial gain or brand endorsementâ.\n She said issues can emerge when young people work with brands - who do not have to comply with standard practise for a child influencer as they would with an in-house production. Dr Rees explains how, when working with a child model or actor, an advertising agency would have to make sure a performance license is in place, and make sure âeverything is in accordance with many layers of legislation and regulation around child protectionâ. But, outside of a professional environment, these safeguards are not in place. She notes that 30-second videos âcan take as long as three days to practice and rehearseâ. And, Dr Rees suggests, this can have a strain on the parent-child relationship. âIt's just not as simple as taking a child on to a set and having them perform to a camera which professionals are involved in.â Read more from Sky News:Four killed as cable car crashes to ground near NaplesTwo dead and five injured in shooting at Florida university The researcher pointed to one particular instance, in which children were advertising an underwear brand on social media. She said: \"The kids in the company's own marketing material or their own media campaigns are either pulling up the band of the underwear underneath their clothing, or they're holding the underwear up while they're fully clothed. \"But whenever you look at any of the sponsored content produced by families with children - mum, dad, and child are in their underwear.\" Dr Rees said it is \"night and day\" in terms of how companies are behaving when they have responsibility for the material, versus \"the lack of responsibility once they hand it over to parents with kids\"."

The force said it is introducing an \"interim position\" while it digests the Supreme Court's decision that the definition of a \"woman\" under the Equality Act 2010 refers to \"a biological woman and biological sex\". A British Transport Police (BTP) Authority spokesman told Sky News: \"Under previous policy, we had advised that someone with a gender recognition certificate (GRC) may be searched in accordance with their acquired sex. \"However, as an interim position while we digest today's judgment, we have advised our officers that any same sex searches in custody are to be undertaken in accordance with the biological birth sex of the detainee.\" Politics latest: Badenoch responds to Jenrick WhatsApp mishap In September last year, BTP, which is responsible for policing the UK's railways and similar transport systems, published its \"position\" on transgender and non-binary officers carrying out strip searches. It said officers would \"only be able to search persons of the same sex on their birth or gender recognition certificate (GRC). Officers who identified as another gender but who did not have a GRC were not allowed to, but if a trans woman had a certificate, they could strip search a female detainee.  Strip searches involve the removal of more than a jacket, outer coat, gloves, headwear and footwear. They \"expose buttocks, genitalia and (female) breasts\", the BTP guidance says. The Sex Matters campaign applied for a judicial review of that guidance with the High Court in December. It said the policy \"puts detainees at risk of sexual harassment and sexual assault\", and said it was a violation of Article 3 of the European Convention on Human Rights, which protects against torture and inhuman or degrading treatment. Sex Matters said the policy \"also puts female officers in a humiliating and dangerous position, as they may be pressured to search trans-identified men\".

She said: \"Obviously, public bodies have been asked to look at their own guidance. \"And we will do that very, very carefully.\" But she warned against public bodies making statements \"that may alarm people\", telling them to take their time to look at their guidance. Baroness Kishwer Falkner, chair of the UK's Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC), said the ruling means there is \"no confusion\" now. She said the NHS will \"have to change\" its 2019 policy, which says transgender patients are entitled to be accommodated on single-sex wards matching how they identify."

Ms Badenoch has previously admitted they will be challenging as her party continues to struggle in the polls, and suggested local Tories might have to partner with Reform councillors if they don't win a majority.

Dr Francis Rees, principal investigator for the Child Influencer Project, explains this is an âescalationâ from the sharing of digital images and performances of the child into âsome form of commercial gain or brand endorsementâ.\n She said issues can emerge when young people work with brands - who do not have to comply with standard practise for a child influencer as they would with an in-house production. Dr Rees explains how, when working with a child model or actor, an advertising agency would have to make sure a performance license is in place, and make sure âeverything is in accordance with many layers of legislation and regulation around child protectionâ. But, outside of a professional environment, these safeguards are not in place. She notes that 30-second videos âcan take as long as three days to practice and rehearseâ. And, Dr Rees suggests, this can have a strain on the parent-child relationship. âIt's just not as simple as taking a child on to a set and having them perform to a camera which professionals are involved in.â Read more from Sky News:Four killed as cable car crashes to ground near NaplesTwo dead and five injured in shooting at Florida university The researcher pointed to one particular instance, in which children were advertising an underwear brand on social media. She said: \"The kids in the company's own marketing material or their own media campaigns are either pulling up the band of the underwear underneath their clothing, or they're holding the underwear up while they're fully clothed. \"But whenever you look at any of the sponsored content produced by families with children - mum, dad, and child are in their underwear.\" Dr Rees said it is \"night and day\" in terms of how companies are behaving when they have responsibility for the material, versus \"the lack of responsibility once they hand it over to parents with kids\"."

But the amino acids that form proteins, the ring-shaped molecules that make up DNA and other organic compounds are just chemistry. It's in the oceans of the early Earth that they became biology. Exactly how isn't known. But life evolved. And if it did so once, could it have happened again? The evidence from planet K2-18b is tantalising. Analysis of how its atmosphere absorbs light strongly suggests the presence of chemicals which on Earth are produced by ocean plankton and other micro-organisms. \n                  Katy Perry floats in space as part of star-studded all-female Blue Origin mission\n                 \n                  Blue Origin rocket launch - as it happened: What Katy Perry sang in space and how all-female crew reacted to flight\n                 \n                  Do the all-female Blue Origin rocket crew count as astronauts?

So far, more than 5,500 planets have been found outside our solar system. Many are in orbits around stars that would put them in the Goldilocks zone - neither too hot, nor too cold, to have liquid water. In other words, habitable. But if life evolves by chance, then it's a numbers game.  Modelling suggests that there could be 300 million planets or moons in our galaxy alone with conditions suitable for life. That's 300 million opportunities for biology to get going. Read more:Katy Perry blasts offThe asteroid heading for Earth And if the right conditions are sustained, then there may have been time for intelligent life to evolve, too. Astronomers scan the skies for radio signals or other signs suggesting alien civilisations. But there's nothing yet. Maybe the lifeforms are smart enough to stay quiet. Or maybe we're looking in the wrong place. But the odds are we're not alone."

        "Content": "\n          Climate reporter\n              @SeabrookClimate\n A team of Japanese scientists have created chunks of lab-grown chicken - in a \"breakthrough\" experts say could pave the way for the creation of larger cuts of meat. In the quest to cultivate meat without the climate impact of farmed animals, scientists have so far only been able to grow tiny chunks of animal cells that have been used to recreate minced meat products like pork meatballs. But a Japanese team has pioneered a new method to grow larger pieces of chicken in a lab, which they say recreates the texture and structure of a piece of meat that has so far proved so elusive. Independent experts have hailed it a \"breakthrough\" and a \"meaningful technical achievement\". The researchers involved believe it paves the way for whole cuts of chicken, beef, and fish to be grown in the lab. \"Cultured meat offers a sustainable, ethical alternative to conventional meat,\" said Shoji Takeuchi from Tokyo University, senior author of the paper published this week in peer-reviewed journal Trends in Biotechnology. \"However, replicating the texture and taste of whole-cut meat remains difficult. Our technology enables the production of structured meat with improved texture and flavour.\" Their method used fine hollow fibres that mimic blood vessels to deliver oxygen and nutrients to living chicken muscle cells, growing them into lumps of meat up to 2cm long and 1cm thick, weighing 10 grams. \"These fibres are already commonly used in household water filters and dialysis machines for patients with kidney disease. \"It's exciting to discover that these tiny fibres can also effectively help create artificial tissues and, possibly, whole organs in the future.\"  Overcoming the 'ick factor' Prof Derek Stewart from The James Hutton Institute, told Sky News: \"I'd class this as a technical breakthrough\". Dr Rodrigo Amaro-Ledesma from Imperial College London called it a \"meaningful technical achievement that they have produced a cultivated chicken meat several centimetres thick\". This, combined with other work on fine-tuning flavours and reducing costs, puts us \"comfortably on track towards an exciting and appealing new range of products\", he said. But in order for cultivated meat products to \"hit the supermarket shelves in a big way, they need to also be a hit with consumers\". The industry prefers the term \"alternative protein\" to \"lab-grown meat\" because it is worried the former gives people the \"ick\". One survey by the Food Standards Agency found a third of UK consumers would be willing to try lab-grown meat. Although the science has advanced rapidly in recent years, no products have yet been authorised for humans to eat, though they have for pets. But the government wants to change that, last year announcing Â£15m of funding, topping up Â£23m from other sources, to try to get them onto our plates in the next two years. That includes speeding up the approvals process so that it can keep up with the evolving science, and lowering currently high input costs. Dr Amaro-Ledesma added: \"Cultivated meat is a promising alternative to conventional meat because it offers the potential to reduce environmental impacts (e.g. greenhouse gas emissions, land and water use), eliminate the need for animal slaughter, and improve food safety by avoiding the use of antibiotics and reducing the risk of zoonotic diseases, amongst other advantages.\" Lydia Collas, head of natural environment at Green Alliance, said: \"We keep seeing exciting breakthroughs towards more sustainable sources of protein, and with decisive action this can be a real opportunity for the UK. \"We already have a lead, thanks to our world-leading biotech industry and high food quality and safety standards. \"The government's forthcoming industrial strategy must include measures to grow the UK industry, which, according to our research, could add Â£6.8bn to the UK economy every year and create 25,000 new jobs by 2035.\""

        "Content": "\n          Arts and entertainment reporter\n              @BethanyMinelle\n  Alex Garland says while it's \"the most obvious statement about life on this planet\" that the world would be a better place without war, it \"doesn't mean it should never happen\", and there are \"circumstances in which war is required\". The Oscar-nominated screenwriter and director told Sky News: \"I don't think it is possible to make a statement about what war is really like without it being implicitly anti-war, inasmuch as it would be better if this thing did not happen. \"But that's not the same as saying it should never happen. There are circumstances in which war is required.\" His latest film, Warfare, embeds the audience within a platoon of American Navy SEALs on an Iraqi surveillance mission gone wrong, telling the story solely through the memories of war veterans from a real 2006 mission in Ramadi, Iraq. Garland says the film is \"anti-war in as much as it is better if war does not happen,\" adding, \"and that is about the most obvious statement about life on this planet that one could make.\" Comparing it to ongoing geopolitical conflict across the world, Garland goes on: \"It would be better if Gaza had not been flattened. It would be better if Ukraine was not invaded. It would it better if all people's problems could be solved via dialogue and not threat or violenceâ¦ \"To be anti-war to me is a rational position, and most veterans I've met are anti-war.\" The screenwriter behind hits including Ex Machina, 28 Days Later and The Beach says this film is \"an attempt to recreate something as faithfully and accurately as we could\". 'War veterans feel invisible and forgotten' Almost entirely based on first-person accounts, the 15-rated film opens with soldiers singing along to the video of Swedish dance hit Call On Me - complete with gyrating women in thong leotards. It's the only music in the film. The remaining score is made up of explosions, sniper fire and screams of pain. Garland co-wrote and co-directed the film alongside Hollywood stuntman and gunfight coordinator Ray Mendoza, whom Garland met on his last film, Civil War. Mendoza, a communications officer on the fateful mission portrayed in the film, says despite the traumatic content, the experience of making the film was \"therapeutic\". Mendoza told Sky News: \"It actually mended a lot of relationshipsâ¦ There were some guys I hadn't spoken to in a very long time. And this allowed us to bury the hatchet, so to speak, on some issues from that day.\" Turning to Hollywood after serving in the Navy for 16 years, Mendoza says past war film he'd seen - even the good ones - were \"a little off\" because they \"don't get the culture right\". Mendoza admits: \"You feel like no one cares because they didn't get it right. You feel invisible. You feel forgotten.\" With screenings of Warfare shown to around 1,000 veterans ahead of general release, Mendoza says: \"They finally feel heard. They finally feel like somebody got it right.\" As to whether it could be triggering for some veterans, Mendoza says decisively not: \"It's not triggering. I would say it's the opposite, for a veteran at least.\" Read more from Sky News:How attack on aid workers unfoldedThe gang war engulfing Scottish cities 'I'm an actor - I love my hair' A tense and raw 90-minute story told in real time, the film's ensemble cast is made up of young buzzy actors, dubbed \"all of the internet's boyfriends\" when the casting was first announced. Mirroring the Navy SEALs they were portraying, the cast initially bonded through a three-week bootcamp ahead of filming, before living together for the 25-day shoot. Black Mirror's Will Poulter, who plays Eric, the officer in charge of the operation, says the film's extended takes and 360-degree sets demanded a special kind of focus. Poulter said: \"It required everyone to practise something that is fundamental to Navy SEAL mentality - you're a teammate before you're an individual. \"When a camera's roaming around like that and could capture anyone at kind of any moment, it requires that everyone to be 'on' at all times and for the sake of each other. \"It becomes less about making sure that you're performing when the camera lands on you, but as much about this idea that you are performing for the sake of the actor opposite you when the camera's on them.\" Another of the film's stars, Reservation Dogs' D'Pharaoh Woon-A-Tai, plays Mendoza and is the heart of the film. Woon-A-Tai says the cast drew on tactics used by real soldiers to help with the intense filming schedule: \"Laughter is medicineâ¦ A lot of times these are long takes, long hours, back-to-back days, so uplifting our spirit was definitely a big part of it.\" He also joked that shaving each other's heads in a bonding ritual the night before the first day of filming was a daunting task. \"As actors, we love our hair. I mean, I speak personally, I love my hair. You know, I had really long hair. So yeah, it definitely takes a lot of trust. And you know, it wasn't even at all, but you know it was still fun to do.\" Warfare is in cinemas now."

The musician, who is the son of The Beatles drummer Ringo Starr and his first wife, Maureen Starkey, had been with the band since 1996, when he joined for their Quadrophenia tour. He was introduced to drumming as a child by \"Uncle Keith\" - The Who drummer and family friend Keith Moon, who died in 1978. Earlier this week, the band issued a statement saying a \"collective decision\" had been made about his departure. It came after their Teenage Cancer Trust shows in March. A review of one gig, published in the Metro, suggested frontman Roger Daltrey - who launched the annual gig series for the charity in 2000 - was \"frustrated\" with the drumming during some tracks. Now, Starkey has issued a statement to Rolling Stone, saying he is \"very proud\" of his near 30 years with The Who. \"Filling the shoes of my Godfather, 'Uncle Keith' has been the biggest honour and I remain their biggest fan,\" he said. \"They've been like family to me.\" \n                  Pete Townshend's Quadrophenia talked about modern masculinity before Gen Z was bornÂ \n                 \n                  The Who's lead singer Roger Daltrey tells fans he's going blind during live show\n                 \n                  Shel Talmy, producer who worked with David Bowie, The Kinks and The Who, dies aged 87\n                 In January, Starkey suffered a blood clot in his right leg and a performance with his other band Mantra Of The Cosmos - which also features Shaun Ryder and Bez from Happy Mondays, and Andy Bell of Ride and Oasis - was cancelled. Referencing this in his statement to Rolling Stone, Starkey said: \"I suffered a serious medical emergency with blood clots in my right bass drum calf. This is now completely healed and does not affect my drumming or running.\" He continued: \"After playing those songs with the band for so many decades, I'm surprised and saddened anyone would have an issue with my performance that night, but what can you do?\" Starkey said he planned to \"take some much needed time off with my family\" and focus on the release of Mantra Of The Cosmos single Domino Bones, which features Noel Gallagher, as well as his autobiography. \"Twenty-nine years at any job is a good old run, and I wish them the best,\" he added. Starkey has also previously played with Oasis, Lightning Seeds and Johnny Marr. While Daltrey starts a solo tour at the weekend, The Who have two shows planned for Italy in July but no full tour. Details of a replacement for Starkey have not been announced."
