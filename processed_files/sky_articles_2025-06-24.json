        "Headline": "As part of a push to rearm, Sir Keir Starmer will give the Royal Air Force the ability to carry air-borne nuclear warheads for the first time since the 1990s.",
        "Content": "\n          Security and Defence Editor\n              @haynesdeborah\n The UK will buy at least 12 F-35 stealth jets that can carry nuclear warheads in the most significant strengthening of its nuclear capability in a generation, the government has said. Today, Sir Keir Starmer will tell a summit of NATO allies in The Hague that the new squadron will join an alliance mission that can be armed with US nuclear weapons. The dramatic move will doubtless draw condemnation and concern from Russia and China. But it comes at a time of growing global insecurity - and as the prime minister and his European and Canadian counterparts scramble to convince Donald Trump they are serious about bolstering their ability to defend Europe, instead of overly relying on the United States. The US president, a long-standing NATO sceptic, raised questions about whether he would uphold the alliance's founding Article 5 principle - that an attack on one is an attack on all - before he even arrived in the Dutch city last night.  An urgent need to keep Mr Trump on side has prompted NATO allies to agree to increase spending on defence and national resilience to a new target of 5% of GDP by 2035. As part of this push to rearm, Sir Keir will give the Royal Air Force the ability to carry airborne nuclear warheads for the first time since the 1990s. \n                  More Britons than ever struggling to make ends meet, report warns\n                 \n                  Welfare versus warfare - the PM has made his choice but faces the hardest fight of his premiership\n                 \n                  What's NATO without America? \n                 \"In an era of radical uncertainty we can no longer take peace for granted,\" he said. \"These F-35 dual capable aircraft will herald a new era for our world-leading Royal Air Force and deter hostile threats that threaten the UK and our allies. \"The UK's commitment to NATO is unquestionable, as is the alliance's contribution to keeping the UK safe and secure, but we must all step up to protect the Euro-Atlantic area for generations to come.\"  It was not immediately clear when the F-35 jets would be bought or how much they will cost, but the new squadron will be part of a NATO-led nuclear deterrence mission. That is in contrast to the UK's national nuclear deterrence, based on a fleet of four nuclear-armed submarines, though they too are used to defend the whole of the alliance. Mark Rutte, the head of NATO, applauded the plan - saying: \"The UK has declared its nuclear deterrent to NATO for many decades, ​and I strongly welcome today's announcement that the UK will now also join NATO's nuclear mission and procure the F-35A. \"This is yet another robust British contribution to NATO.\" Aircraft operated by a small number of NATO countries, including Belgium, Germany and the Netherlands, are cleared to carry US-provided nuclear weapons in a war. The RAF and the Royal Navy already operate F-35B jets that can fly off Britain's two aircraft carriers, but they are not equipped to drop nuclear warheads. The new planes will be the F-35A variant, operated by the air force, that take off from land but can fly further and be armed with nuclear or conventional weapons. The government said they would all be based together at RAF Marham in Norfolk. The government has long planned to purchase a total of 138 F-35 aircraft, but has so far only acquired around three dozen - seven years since the first jets entered service. The decision to purchase 12 of the A-variant does not mean extra aircraft. It just means a diversification in the fleet - something the RAF has long been pushing for - though it's a decision some in the Royal Navy have long pushed back against, believing it would reduce even further the number of the B-version that operate from their carriers. Read more:PM warns of 'era of radical uncertainty'Podcast - What is NATO without America?  The government described the plan to purchase nuclear-capable aircraft as the \"biggest strengthening of the UK's nuclear posture in a generation\". Defence Secretary John Healey said a major defence review published earlier in the month highlighted new nuclear risks. \"It recommended a new UK role in our collective defence and deterrence through a NATO-first approach,\" he said. However, the public version of the Strategic Defence Review stopped short of making any specific recommendation. It merely said \"the UK must explore how to support the US and its NATO allies in strengthening extended deterrence across the Euro-Atlantic\". The F-35 aircraft is made by the US defence giant Lockheed Martin, but the British defence company BAE Systems is also a key contributor. The order will support 20,000 jobs in the F-35 programme in the UK."

        "Content": "\n          US correspondent\n              @Stone_SkyNews\n  There is a critical question hanging over the events of the past few days. Behind the chest-thumping from Donald Trump, and the bewilderment beyond at his statecraft-by-social-media, doubts have now reached fever pitch about the success of the American bombing of Iran's nuclear sites. Leaks from the US Defence Department suggest the bunker busting bombs dropped on Iran's three nuclear enrichment sites might only have set the country's nuclear capabilities back by months. \"We were assuming that the damage was going to be much more significant than this assessment is finding,\" said one of three sources, speaking to NBC News. \"This assessment is already finding that these core pieces are still intact. That's a bad sign for the overall programme.\" NBC News has spoken to three sources - all of whom say that the initial assessment by the Defence Intelligence Agency has concluded that the US airstrikes were not as effective as Mr Trump claimed. Similar leaks were made to The New York Times, The Washington Post and CNN. \n                  In dramatic move, UK to buy F-35 stealth jets that can carry US nuclear warheads\n                 \n                  Do Israel and Iran know ‘what the f***’ they’re doing now?\n                 \n                  Donald Trump dodges commitment to founding NATO principle\n                 Follow latest developments in our live blog  Responding to the CNN leak, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said: \"This alleged assessment is flat-out wrong and was classified as 'top secret' but was still leaked to CNN by an anonymous, low-level loser in the intelligence community.\" She continued: \"The leaking of this alleged assessment is a clear attempt to demean President Trump, and discredit the brave fighter pilots who conducted a perfectly executed mission to obliterate Iran's nuclear programme. Everyone knows what happens when you drop 14 30,000lb bombs perfectly on their targets: total obliteration.\" In his address to the nation on Saturday night, Mr Trump had said: \"I can report to the world that the strikes were a spectacular military success. Iran's key nuclear enrichment facilities have been completely and totally obliterated.\"  US Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth has also dismissed the leaks, saying: \"Based on everything we have seen - and I've seen it all - our bombing campaign obliterated Iran's ability to create nuclear weapons. \"Our massive bombs hit exactly the right spot at each target - and worked perfectly.\" \"The impact of those bombs is buried under a mountain of rubble in Iran, so anyone who says the bombs were not devastating is just trying to undermine the president and the successful mission.\"  Battle Damage Assessments (BDAs) take a long time to be close to conclusive and require extensive intelligence analysis. Speaking to Sky News, former director of the CIA and top US General David Petraeus cautioned about drawing any conclusions at this stage. \"Well, the truth is, it is just too soon. And those who are leaking should know that it takes a long time to do the battle damage assessment. And those who have actually pushed back in very conclusive ways also probably should have wait for the full results,\" Gen Petraeus said. \"This is a very painstaking process. It's an effort by the overall intelligence community, not just Defence Intelligence Agency. In fact, the CIA would be the lead in this effort to mine all sources of intelligence, imagery, intelligence of all types, signals, cyber, even open-source intelligence.\" Read more analysis:There's one F word Trump fears mostCan Tehran regard Trump as trusted broker of peace?  Beyond the debate over the extent of the damage, questions remain over whether Iran might have managed to move equipment including centrifuges. Critically too, the whereabouts of about 400kg of highly enriched uranium is unknown. The classified assessment of the military's operation in Iran has been transmitted to Congress and has been viewed by some senators in a secure location, according to two sources with direct knowledge of the situation. \"I've reviewed the classified material,\" Democratic Party Senator Tim Kaine, a member of the Armed Services Committee, said. \"I'm a little bit disappointed that my colleagues went and looked at it and mainly started talking about it publicly. That's not we're supposed to do with a classified report,\" he added.  Speaking on Sunday to NBC's Meet The Press, Israel's ambassador to the UN Danny Danon insisted Iran's nuclear capability had been dramatically set back. \"I think it's still very early to jump into conclusions. We have to wait for the assessment. I can tell you one thing for sure. If you look where Iran was 12 days ago and where they are today, you understand that both Israel and the US were able to degrade the capabilities, push them back decades, and if we had an imminent threat, it doesn't exist anymore.\""

        "Content": "\n          Political reporter\n              @WillCharley1\n  Foreign criminals in prisons across England and Wales will be deported at an earlier point in their sentence under new government plans. The proposed legislation, to be presented in Parliament today, comes as part of efforts to tackle prison overcrowding. Currently, foreign inmates with no right to stay in the UK are sent back to their home country after serving half of their sentence. But under the plans, they will instead be removed after just 30% of their term. The measure would apply to those given determinate sentences - fixed maximum terms in prison that offenders do not necessarily serve all of behind bars. It would not apply to those convicted of terrorism or terror-related offences. The Ministry of Justice (MoJ) estimates that, combined with other upcoming reforms, some foreign prisoners would end up serving only 10% of their sentence in England and Wales, down from about 20 to 25% currently. The law is also being tweaked so they can be deported 48 months before the end of their custodial sentence, rather than 18 months before. The changes will free up an estimated 500 cells per year, with around 12% of the prison population currently made up of foreign offenders, according to the government.  The MoJ said the proposals should also save the taxpayer millions of pounds, with the average prison place costing £54,000 per year. Justice Secretary Shabana Mahmood said: \"With prisons close to bursting, I'm clear we shouldn't be giving bed and board to foreign criminals with no right to be here. \"These changes will get more of them on planes out of the country much sooner, saving taxpayers' money and keeping our streets safe as part of our Plan for Change. \"This government's message is crystal clear - if you come here and break our laws, you'll be sent packing in record time.\"  The proposals follow calls from the Conservatives for a change in the law to give the government the power to deport all foreign criminals. The MoJ said the measure would be a discretionary power, meaning that some prisoners may be refused permission to be deported in certain circumstances, such as if there was clear evidence they were planning further crime. The government hopes the shake-up will come into effect in September, if it is approved in Parliament. Ministers have repeatedly warned that the prison system is overcrowded, overstretched and understaffed. Last month, Ms Mahmood announced the government would be adopting a range of measures to ease prison overcrowding, following an independent review by former Tory justice secretary David Gauke."

Published today, it said it was \"the first time in many years\" that such an event has had to be considered. It comes as Sky News recently explored what a Russian attack on Britain looked like in The Wargame podcast. Politics latest: PM at NATO summit  The review highlighted Russia and Iran as potential threats, including saying that the latter's \"hostile activity\" on British soil is increasing in an effort to \"silence critics\" as well as \"directly threatening the UK\". It added: \"Meanwhile, some adversaries are laying the foundations for future conflict, positioning themselves to move quickly to cause major disruption to our energy and or supply chains, to deter us from standing up to their aggression.\"  Responding to the report, Sir Keir Starmer said the UK is \"facing daily challenges on the home front\" The prime minister told Sky News' political editor Beth Rigby that Britain is being targeted by \"very, very frequent and very, very serious\" cyberattacks Energy security is also a concern following Russia's invasion of Ukraine, while the PM also cited the threat of Iran. \"We have to guard properly against those threats, and we will do so,\" Starmer added. 👉Search for The Wargame on your podcast app👈 The government will run annual exercises to test the preparedness of the whole of society as part of efforts to rebuild resilience, the new strategy says. There will also be moves to improve security around critical national infrastructure such as power stations and water supplies as part of what is being called \"Home Defence\". However, the review concedes that \"we cannot stop every hostile actor\". Instead it says the UK will try to \"make the UK a harder target for adversaries and criminals\". Inside The Wargame An armed attack on the UK is exactly the scenario that a new podcast series by Sky News and Tortoise explore. The Wargame simulates Russian missiles strikes against targets across the country to test UK defences. The podcast also draws on the UK's Cold War past.  During the time of the Soviet Union, Britain, like much of the rest of NATO, maintained a much larger professional army, navy and air force, with greater stockpiles of munitions, a bigger reserve force and a far more comprehensive air defence system. This was all kept at a state of readiness that meant the UK could immediately respond to war breaking out. At the same time, wider society was better prepared for conflict - including nuclear war. They also understood the need to allocate more taxpayer cash into funding defence as the ultimate insurance policy. When the Cold War ended though, successive governments took what was seen as a peace dividend, switching investment away from defence and into other priorities such as health, welfare and economic growth. With Britain now facing renewed threats to the home front but without the resilience it relied on in the past, The Wargame plays out what might happen in a crisis."

The Tory leader told Sky News she would be asking for three commitments from Sir Keir Starmer, if he wants to use Conservative votes to pass the reforms to disability benefits, which have triggered an unprecedented rebellion of more than 100 Labour MPs. Ms Badenoch said: \"I'm just making it very clear to Keir Starmer that if he will make commitments at the despatch box to meet our conditions which are to reduce the welfare budget, to get people into work and not to have tax rises, then we can support his bill. \"The bill is a bit of a mess. It needs some work. It looks like it's been rushed for Rachel [Reeves] to fix other problems that they've got. But our welfare budget is far too high, and we really need to bring it down.\" PM warns UK must prepare for war at home - follow latest The prospect of the bill passing on Conservative votes would outrage Labour MPs. An amendment they have tabled says they cannot support the bill because it would drive disabled people into poverty, and they are concerned about whether people losing benefits would find work. \n                  Latest polling says if an election was held tomorrow Reform UK would win a majority\n                 \n                  Is Kemi Badenoch's grooming gangs outrage just politics or does she really care?\n                 \n                  Kemi Badenoch: ECHR has become 'sword used to attack democratic decisions'\n                 Around 119 Labour MPs have now signed the amendment, while Sadiq Khan has become the most senior Labour figure to call for a \"rethink\". The mayor of London has warned that the proposed cuts would \"destroy [the] financial safety net\" for \"too many disabled Londonders\". Welfare Secretary Liz Kendall has tried to reassure Labour MPs about the changes. But the rebels are hoping the government will water down their proposals in order to get Labour support. The prime minister, speaking at a NATO summit in The Hague on Tuesday, insisted the government would press ahead. Keir Starmer told Sky News: \"We've got to get on and make that reform because the options are: leave the system as it is, trusting people and not helping them, that's not a Labour option. The Labour option is to reform it and make it fit for the future. So we're going to press ahead with these reforms.\"  A vote is looming next Tuesday with Labour MPs deeply concerned about the changes which will see 370,000 current PIP claimants lose benefit, and affect 3 million people in total. The rebels hope the government will climb down. One of them, Neil Duncan-Jordan, the MP for Poole, told Sky News that relying on Conservative votes \"is not a good look for any government\". He added: \"If you can't rely on your own party, I think you're in a serious place.\" Responding to Ms Badenoch's offer, a Labour spokesperson said the government was \"elected to deliver change\" and that it's \"prepared to take on the challenges holding the UK back\". They added: \"We're fixing the abysmal mess the Tories left behind, and MPs can either vote to keep a broken failed welfare system that writes people off, or they can vote to start fixing it. \"Next week's bill is a test for the leader of the opposition as to whether her party has learned anything at all by being roundly rejected by Britain.\""

The 39-year-old, who reportedly played the groom in the fake ceremony, faces several counts of fraud, abuse of trust, money laundering and identity theft after he was arrested at the entertainment resort on Saturday. Police were called by a \"guest\" who later claimed he was hired to play the role of father of the bride. In a statement, the prosecutor of the tribunal in Meaux, Jean-Baptiste Bladier, said the man \"explained he was paid €12,000 (£10,000) to play the role of the father of the bride and realised at the last minute that she was nine years old\". The girl is a Ukrainian national who had arrived in France with her 41-year-old mother two days before the mock ceremony, the prosecutor added. Four people were arrested on Saturday, including the British \"groom\", the girl's mother, a 24-year-old Latvian woman who played the sister of the bride and the 55-year-old Latvian man hired to play the \"father of the bride\", the tribunal said. Disneyland Paris was \"deceived\" after the identity of a Latvian man and fake identification documents were used to secure the private event at the park, prosecutors added. Around 100 hired extras were also falsely presented to the company as wedding guests. The British man appeared before the tribunal of Meaux on Monday, after which he was charged. French prosecutors said they had been in touch with authorities in the UK and had identified the suspect as a convicted sexual offender who is wanted in the UK.

Preliminary findings stated the \"groom\" had allegedly been \"made-up professionally so that his face appeared totally different from his own\", according to the prosecutor. The 24-year-old Latvian woman currently remains a witness in the investigation, he added. Disneyland Paris has been approached for comments."

The billionaire will marry Lauren Sanchez in the Italian city this week, and the couple will mark the occasion with three days of celebrations costing up to €48m (£41m). The venue where the couple will say their vows has been kept secret, but their wedding party has at the last minute been moved out of the city centre, Reuters news agency reports. It had been due to take place at the Scuola Grande della Misericordia but will now be held at the Arsenale, a source told Reuters. The new venue is a 14th-century complex surrounded by water and impossible to reach by land when bridges are raised. €48m price tag The wedding and its parts are expected to cost an eye-watering €40-48m (£34-£41m), Luca Zaia, the president of Venice's local government, said on Tuesday. This includes sizeable charity donations from the Amazon founder, including €1m (£850k) to Corila, a consortium that studies Venice's lagoon ecosystem, local media has reported.  90 private jets  The first private jets began landing at Venice airport on Tuesday and there will be around 90 in total, Mr Zaia said. \n  They won't all be arriving in Venice though, as some will land at the nearby Treviso and Verona airports. 250 guests  Five of the city's most luxurious hotels have been booked out to host an estimated 200-250 guests.  These include the celeb favourite Cipriani, where George and Amal Clooney married in 2014. 30 water taxis Attendees of course won't be hopping on public water buses to get around the city's many islands.  The wedding's organisers have booked at least 30 water taxis for them to use instead.  Amid the last-minute changes, guests, including Donald Trump's daughter, have begun arriving in Italy. Ivanka Trump and her husband, Jared Kushner, were seen boarding a water taxi at Venice airport on Tuesday, as was fashion designer Diane von Furstenberg. The move comes after weeks of protests from some local residents and pressure groups, who say Bezos and his fiancee are not welcome in the city. Read more: Why are activists protesting the wedding? The leader of the 'No Space for Bezos' campaign said: \"The news that Bezos has run away from the Misericordia is a great victory for us.\" The group has announced more protests for Saturday, believed to be the main day of celebrations, and pledged to make the event a \"nightmare\" for Bezos and his guests."

        "Content": "\n          Security and Defence Editor\n              @haynesdeborah\n The UK will buy at least 12 F-35 stealth jets that can carry nuclear warheads in the most significant strengthening of its nuclear capability in a generation, the government has said. Today, Sir Keir Starmer will tell a summit of NATO allies in The Hague that the new squadron will join an alliance mission that can be armed with US nuclear weapons. The dramatic move will doubtless draw condemnation and concern from Russia and China. But it comes at a time of growing global insecurity - and as the prime minister and his European and Canadian counterparts scramble to convince Donald Trump they are serious about bolstering their ability to defend Europe, instead of overly relying on the United States. The US president, a long-standing NATO sceptic, raised questions about whether he would uphold the alliance's founding Article 5 principle - that an attack on one is an attack on all - before he even arrived in the Dutch city last night.  An urgent need to keep Mr Trump on side has prompted NATO allies to agree to increase spending on defence and national resilience to a new target of 5% of GDP by 2035. As part of this push to rearm, Sir Keir will give the Royal Air Force the ability to carry airborne nuclear warheads for the first time since the 1990s. \n                  More Britons than ever struggling to make ends meet, report warns\n                 \n                  Welfare versus warfare - the PM has made his choice but faces the hardest fight of his premiership\n                 \n                  What's NATO without America? \n                 \"In an era of radical uncertainty we can no longer take peace for granted,\" he said. \"These F-35 dual capable aircraft will herald a new era for our world-leading Royal Air Force and deter hostile threats that threaten the UK and our allies. \"The UK's commitment to NATO is unquestionable, as is the alliance's contribution to keeping the UK safe and secure, but we must all step up to protect the Euro-Atlantic area for generations to come.\"  It was not immediately clear when the F-35 jets would be bought or how much they will cost, but the new squadron will be part of a NATO-led nuclear deterrence mission. That is in contrast to the UK's national nuclear deterrence, based on a fleet of four nuclear-armed submarines, though they too are used to defend the whole of the alliance. Mark Rutte, the head of NATO, applauded the plan - saying: \"The UK has declared its nuclear deterrent to NATO for many decades, ​and I strongly welcome today's announcement that the UK will now also join NATO's nuclear mission and procure the F-35A. \"This is yet another robust British contribution to NATO.\" Aircraft operated by a small number of NATO countries, including Belgium, Germany and the Netherlands, are cleared to carry US-provided nuclear weapons in a war. The RAF and the Royal Navy already operate F-35B jets that can fly off Britain's two aircraft carriers, but they are not equipped to drop nuclear warheads. The new planes will be the F-35A variant, operated by the air force, that take off from land but can fly further and be armed with nuclear or conventional weapons. The government said they would all be based together at RAF Marham in Norfolk. The government has long planned to purchase a total of 138 F-35 aircraft, but has so far only acquired around three dozen - seven years since the first jets entered service. The decision to purchase 12 of the A-variant does not mean extra aircraft. It just means a diversification in the fleet - something the RAF has long been pushing for - though it's a decision some in the Royal Navy have long pushed back against, believing it would reduce even further the number of the B-version that operate from their carriers. Read more:PM warns of 'era of radical uncertainty'Podcast - What is NATO without America?  The government described the plan to purchase nuclear-capable aircraft as the \"biggest strengthening of the UK's nuclear posture in a generation\". Defence Secretary John Healey said a major defence review published earlier in the month highlighted new nuclear risks. \"It recommended a new UK role in our collective defence and deterrence through a NATO-first approach,\" he said. However, the public version of the Strategic Defence Review stopped short of making any specific recommendation. It merely said \"the UK must explore how to support the US and its NATO allies in strengthening extended deterrence across the Euro-Atlantic\". The F-35 aircraft is made by the US defence giant Lockheed Martin, but the British defence company BAE Systems is also a key contributor. The order will support 20,000 jobs in the F-35 programme in the UK."

Published today, it said it was \"the first time in many years\" that such an event has had to be considered. It comes as Sky News recently explored what a Russian attack on Britain looked like in The Wargame podcast. Politics latest: PM at NATO summit  The review highlighted Russia and Iran as potential threats, including saying that the latter's \"hostile activity\" on British soil is increasing in an effort to \"silence critics\" as well as \"directly threatening the UK\". It added: \"Meanwhile, some adversaries are laying the foundations for future conflict, positioning themselves to move quickly to cause major disruption to our energy and or supply chains, to deter us from standing up to their aggression.\"  Responding to the report, Sir Keir Starmer said the UK is \"facing daily challenges on the home front\" The prime minister told Sky News' political editor Beth Rigby that Britain is being targeted by \"very, very frequent and very, very serious\" cyberattacks Energy security is also a concern following Russia's invasion of Ukraine, while the PM also cited the threat of Iran. \"We have to guard properly against those threats, and we will do so,\" Starmer added. 👉Search for The Wargame on your podcast app👈 The government will run annual exercises to test the preparedness of the whole of society as part of efforts to rebuild resilience, the new strategy says. There will also be moves to improve security around critical national infrastructure such as power stations and water supplies as part of what is being called \"Home Defence\". However, the review concedes that \"we cannot stop every hostile actor\". Instead it says the UK will try to \"make the UK a harder target for adversaries and criminals\". Inside The Wargame An armed attack on the UK is exactly the scenario that a new podcast series by Sky News and Tortoise explore. The Wargame simulates Russian missiles strikes against targets across the country to test UK defences. The podcast also draws on the UK's Cold War past.  During the time of the Soviet Union, Britain, like much of the rest of NATO, maintained a much larger professional army, navy and air force, with greater stockpiles of munitions, a bigger reserve force and a far more comprehensive air defence system. This was all kept at a state of readiness that meant the UK could immediately respond to war breaking out. At the same time, wider society was better prepared for conflict - including nuclear war. They also understood the need to allocate more taxpayer cash into funding defence as the ultimate insurance policy. When the Cold War ended though, successive governments took what was seen as a peace dividend, switching investment away from defence and into other priorities such as health, welfare and economic growth. With Britain now facing renewed threats to the home front but without the resilience it relied on in the past, The Wargame plays out what might happen in a crisis."

        "Content": "\n          Political reporter\n              @WillCharley1\n  Foreign criminals in prisons across England and Wales will be deported at an earlier point in their sentence under new government plans. The proposed legislation, to be presented in Parliament today, comes as part of efforts to tackle prison overcrowding. Currently, foreign inmates with no right to stay in the UK are sent back to their home country after serving half of their sentence. But under the plans, they will instead be removed after just 30% of their term. The measure would apply to those given determinate sentences - fixed maximum terms in prison that offenders do not necessarily serve all of behind bars. It would not apply to those convicted of terrorism or terror-related offences. The Ministry of Justice (MoJ) estimates that, combined with other upcoming reforms, some foreign prisoners would end up serving only 10% of their sentence in England and Wales, down from about 20 to 25% currently. The law is also being tweaked so they can be deported 48 months before the end of their custodial sentence, rather than 18 months before. The changes will free up an estimated 500 cells per year, with around 12% of the prison population currently made up of foreign offenders, according to the government.  The MoJ said the proposals should also save the taxpayer millions of pounds, with the average prison place costing £54,000 per year. Justice Secretary Shabana Mahmood said: \"With prisons close to bursting, I'm clear we shouldn't be giving bed and board to foreign criminals with no right to be here. \"These changes will get more of them on planes out of the country much sooner, saving taxpayers' money and keeping our streets safe as part of our Plan for Change. \"This government's message is crystal clear - if you come here and break our laws, you'll be sent packing in record time.\"  The proposals follow calls from the Conservatives for a change in the law to give the government the power to deport all foreign criminals. The MoJ said the measure would be a discretionary power, meaning that some prisoners may be refused permission to be deported in certain circumstances, such as if there was clear evidence they were planning further crime. The government hopes the shake-up will come into effect in September, if it is approved in Parliament. Ministers have repeatedly warned that the prison system is overcrowded, overstretched and understaffed. Last month, Ms Mahmood announced the government would be adopting a range of measures to ease prison overcrowding, following an independent review by former Tory justice secretary David Gauke."

The Tory leader told Sky News she would be asking for three commitments from Sir Keir Starmer, if he wants to use Conservative votes to pass the reforms to disability benefits, which have triggered an unprecedented rebellion of more than 100 Labour MPs. Ms Badenoch said: \"I'm just making it very clear to Keir Starmer that if he will make commitments at the despatch box to meet our conditions which are to reduce the welfare budget, to get people into work and not to have tax rises, then we can support his bill. \"The bill is a bit of a mess. It needs some work. It looks like it's been rushed for Rachel [Reeves] to fix other problems that they've got. But our welfare budget is far too high, and we really need to bring it down.\" PM warns UK must prepare for war at home - follow latest The prospect of the bill passing on Conservative votes would outrage Labour MPs.

The mayor of London has warned that the proposed cuts would \"destroy [the] financial safety net\" for \"too many disabled Londonders\". Welfare Secretary Liz Kendall has tried to reassure Labour MPs about the changes. But the rebels are hoping the government will water down their proposals in order to get Labour support. The prime minister, speaking at a NATO summit in The Hague on Tuesday, insisted the government would press ahead. Keir Starmer told Sky News: \"We've got to get on and make that reform because the options are: leave the system as it is, trusting people and not helping them, that's not a Labour option. The Labour option is to reform it and make it fit for the future. So we're going to press ahead with these reforms.\"  A vote is looming next Tuesday with Labour MPs deeply concerned about the changes which will see 370,000 current PIP claimants lose benefit, and affect 3 million people in total. The rebels hope the government will climb down. One of them, Neil Duncan-Jordan, the MP for Poole, told Sky News that relying on Conservative votes \"is not a good look for any government\". He added: \"If you can't rely on your own party, I think you're in a serious place.\" Responding to Ms Badenoch's offer, a Labour spokesperson said the government was \"elected to deliver change\" and that it's \"prepared to take on the challenges holding the UK back\". They added: \"We're fixing the abysmal mess the Tories left behind, and MPs can either vote to keep a broken failed welfare system that writes people off, or they can vote to start fixing it. \"Next week's bill is a test for the leader of the opposition as to whether her party has learned anything at all by being roundly rejected by Britain.\""

James Harding, 34, and his \"loyal right-hand man\" Jayes Kharouti, 39, were found guilty of conspiracy to murder on Tuesday. Harding was also convicted of conspiring with others to import cocaine, which Kharouti, from Epsom in Surrey, had admitted. Three other members of the organised crime group had previously admitted drug offences. The men's criminal empire made £5m in profits from importing drugs over 10 weeks in 2020 alone. The trial of both men was held at the Old Bailey in London amid heightened security. The court heard they had tried to recruit a hitman to put an unnamed rival courier \"permanently out of business\". They armed him with a gun and ammunition for the \"full M\", which the court was told meant a murder. At the time, Harding, who told people he was a high-end watch sales executive, was living in luxury in Dubai, staying in five-star hotels and driving Bugatti and Lamborghini sports cars. But the plot was scuppered by officers from Scotland Yard, who accessed the defendants' discussions on EncroChat. The force was handed the data after French police cracked the encryption code of the communications service. 'Cannot hide' Prosecuting, Duncan Atkinson KC, told the court the defendants used EncroChat to discuss importing a tonne of cocaine over a period of 10 weeks. In messages on the platform, the pair discussed the robbery of a drugs courier, which became a plan to kill the courier instead. The defendants discussed how and where the murder would take place, and the court was told that Kharouti had offered the potential hitman £100,000. Kharouti's boss told him the plan should involve a \"double tap\" shot to the head and chest. The alleged hitman was arrested on suspicion of conspiracy to murder in the early hours of 3 June 2020, but the defendants were unaware. Harding was arrested at Geneva airport and extradited from Switzerland on 27 December 2021, while Kharouti was extradited from Turkey on 25 June last year. Harding denied using the handle \"the topsking\" on the platform, and instead claimed that it belonged to an \"intimate\" male partner called TK. Detective Chief Inspector Jim Casey, who led the investigation, said the case showed \"criminals cannot hide behind encrypted software\". \"We monitored their drug-dealing activity but then we saw the group discussing the contract killing of a rival.

        "Content": "\n          US correspondent\n              @Stone_SkyNews\n  There is a critical question hanging over the events of the past few days. Behind the chest-thumping from Donald Trump, and the bewilderment beyond at his statecraft-by-social-media, doubts have now reached fever pitch about the success of the American bombing of Iran's nuclear sites. Leaks from the US Defence Department suggest the bunker busting bombs dropped on Iran's three nuclear enrichment sites might only have set the country's nuclear capabilities back by months. \"We were assuming that the damage was going to be much more significant than this assessment is finding,\" said one of three sources, speaking to NBC News. \"This assessment is already finding that these core pieces are still intact. That's a bad sign for the overall programme.\" NBC News has spoken to three sources - all of whom say that the initial assessment by the Defence Intelligence Agency has concluded that the US airstrikes were not as effective as Mr Trump claimed. Similar leaks were made to The New York Times, The Washington Post and CNN. \n                  In dramatic move, UK to buy F-35 stealth jets that can carry US nuclear warheads\n                 \n                  Do Israel and Iran know ‘what the f***’ they’re doing now?\n                 \n                  Donald Trump dodges commitment to founding NATO principle\n                 Follow latest developments in our live blog  Responding to the CNN leak, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said: \"This alleged assessment is flat-out wrong and was classified as 'top secret' but was still leaked to CNN by an anonymous, low-level loser in the intelligence community.\" She continued: \"The leaking of this alleged assessment is a clear attempt to demean President Trump, and discredit the brave fighter pilots who conducted a perfectly executed mission to obliterate Iran's nuclear programme. Everyone knows what happens when you drop 14 30,000lb bombs perfectly on their targets: total obliteration.\" In his address to the nation on Saturday night, Mr Trump had said: \"I can report to the world that the strikes were a spectacular military success. Iran's key nuclear enrichment facilities have been completely and totally obliterated.\"  US Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth has also dismissed the leaks, saying: \"Based on everything we have seen - and I've seen it all - our bombing campaign obliterated Iran's ability to create nuclear weapons. \"Our massive bombs hit exactly the right spot at each target - and worked perfectly.\" \"The impact of those bombs is buried under a mountain of rubble in Iran, so anyone who says the bombs were not devastating is just trying to undermine the president and the successful mission.\"  Battle Damage Assessments (BDAs) take a long time to be close to conclusive and require extensive intelligence analysis. Speaking to Sky News, former director of the CIA and top US General David Petraeus cautioned about drawing any conclusions at this stage. \"Well, the truth is, it is just too soon. And those who are leaking should know that it takes a long time to do the battle damage assessment. And those who have actually pushed back in very conclusive ways also probably should have wait for the full results,\" Gen Petraeus said. \"This is a very painstaking process. It's an effort by the overall intelligence community, not just Defence Intelligence Agency. In fact, the CIA would be the lead in this effort to mine all sources of intelligence, imagery, intelligence of all types, signals, cyber, even open-source intelligence.\" Read more analysis:There's one F word Trump fears mostCan Tehran regard Trump as trusted broker of peace?  Beyond the debate over the extent of the damage, questions remain over whether Iran might have managed to move equipment including centrifuges. Critically too, the whereabouts of about 400kg of highly enriched uranium is unknown. The classified assessment of the military's operation in Iran has been transmitted to Congress and has been viewed by some senators in a secure location, according to two sources with direct knowledge of the situation. \"I've reviewed the classified material,\" Democratic Party Senator Tim Kaine, a member of the Armed Services Committee, said. \"I'm a little bit disappointed that my colleagues went and looked at it and mainly started talking about it publicly. That's not we're supposed to do with a classified report,\" he added.  Speaking on Sunday to NBC's Meet The Press, Israel's ambassador to the UN Danny Danon insisted Iran's nuclear capability had been dramatically set back. \"I think it's still very early to jump into conclusions. We have to wait for the assessment. I can tell you one thing for sure. If you look where Iran was 12 days ago and where they are today, you understand that both Israel and the US were able to degrade the capabilities, push them back decades, and if we had an imminent threat, it doesn't exist anymore.\""

        "Content": "\n          Military analyst\n       Ceasefires that are suddenly declared tend to be pretty fragile. Stable ceasefires usually require a lot of preparation so that everyone on both sides knows what is supposed to happen, and - more importantly - when. And they normally agree on how it will be monitored so one side cannot seize a quick advantage by breaking it suddenly. Israel-Iran live updates: Trump swears live on camera as he rages at Israel and Iran Without such preparations, and sometimes even with them, ceasefires will tend to be breached - perhaps by accident, perhaps because one side does not exercise full control over its own forces, perhaps as a result of false alarms, or even because a third party - a guerrilla group or a militia, say - choose that moment to launch an attack of their own.  The important question is whether a ceasefire breach is just random and unfortunate, or else deliberate and systemic - where someone is actively trying to break it. Either way, ceasefires have to be politically reinforced all the time if they are to hold. Read more from Sky News:Israel-Iran ceasefire hopes drive down oil and gas costs'They don't know what the f*** they're doing': Trump rages  All sides may need to rededicate themselves to it at regular intervals, mainly because, as genuine enemies, they won't trust each other and will remain naturally suspicious at every twitch and utterance from the other side. This is where an external power like the United States plays a critical part. If enemies like Israel and Iran naturally distrust each other and need little incentive to \"hit back\" in some way at every provocation, it will take US pressure to make them abide by a ceasefire that may be breaking down. Appeals to good nature are hardly relevant in this respect. An external arbiter has to make the continuance of a ceasefire a matter of hard national interest to both sides. And that often requires as much bullying as persuasion. It may be true that \"blessed are the peacemakers\"."

        "Content": "At least 44 people have been killed after Israeli forces and drones opened fire on people waiting for aid in two separate incidents in Gaza, according to witnesses and hospital officials. In one of the incidents, witnesses told the Associated Press (AP) news agency that Israeli forces fired as people were advancing towards approaching aid trucks on a road south of Wadi Gaza in central Gaza. The Awda hospital in the Nuseirat refugee camp, which treated some of the victims, confirmed 25 deaths and said another 146 people were wounded. Among them were 62 people in a critical condition, who were transferred to other hospitals, it added. Israel-Iran live updates: Trump tells two sides 'do not violate' ceasefire  In the central town of Deir al-Balah, the Al Aqsa Martyrs hospital said it received the bodies of six people who were killed in the same incident. \"It was a massacre,\" witness Ahmed Halawa said. He said tanks and drones fired at people, \"even as we were fleeing - many people were either martyred or wounded\". Another witness, Hossam Abu Shahada, said drones were flying over the area. Then there was gunfire from tanks and drones, leaving a \"chaotic and bloody\" scene as people attempted to escape. He said he saw at least three people lying on the ground motionless and many others wounded as he fled.  In the other incident, in Gaza's southernmost city of Rafah, witnesses said Israeli troops started firing as thousands of Palestinians gathered at the Shakoush area, several hundred yards from another aid distribution site. At least 19 were killed and 50 others wounded, according to Nasser hospital and Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry. Witness Ayman Abu Joda said he saw heavy gunfire from Israeli tanks and helped evacuate three wounded people, including one who had been hit in the chest. \"It was the same tragedy every day: We seek food and the occupation opens fire and kills many,\" he said. The Israeli military did not immediately comment on the reports. Gaza aid mechanism 'an abomination', says UN  Food distribution sites in the region are run by the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF), an American contractor operating with support from the US and Israeli governments. Philippe Lazzarini, the head of the UN's Palestinian refugee agency, described the aid delivery mechanism in Gaza as \"an abomination that humiliates and degrades desperate people\". He added: \"It is a death trap, costing more lives than it saves.\" A spokesperson for the UN's Human Rights Office said: \"The weaponisation of food for civilians, in addition to restricting or preventing their access to life-sustaining services, constitutes a war crime and, under certain circumstances, may constitute elements of other crimes under international law.\" Meanwhile, Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry said more than 56,000 Palestinians had now been killed during Israel's 21-month military operation in the territory. The ministry said more than half of the dead were women and children. It does not distinguish between civilians and militants in its count. The latest conflict in Gaza began after Hamas attacked Israel on 7 October 2023, when militants stormed across the border and killed around 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and took another 251 hostages. Many of the hostages have been released in ceasefire agreements."

        "Content": " Donald Trump has dodged a question about whether he is still committed to Article 5 of NATO, the alliance's founding principle. The clause asserts the principle of collective and mutual defence, meaning an attack against one NATO ally is considered an attack against all members. It came as the US president spoke to reporters on Air Force One on his way to the NATO summit in The Hague, the Netherlands, and was asked about his commitment to Article 5. He replied that it \"depends on your definition\" of it, while adding that he was \"committed to being their friend\". Mr Trump added: \"You know, I've become friends with many of those leaders, and I'm committed to helping them. \"I'm committed to saving lives. I'm committed to life and safety, and I'm going to give you an exact definition. When I get there. I just don't want to do it on the back of an airplane.\" The NATO summit is intended to signal to Russian President Vladimir Putin that the alliance is united and set on expanding and upgrading its defences to deter any attack on its members from Moscow. But Mr Trump's comments cast renewed doubt on his willingness to protect the US's allies. However, NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte said he had \"no doubt\" that the US was \"totally committed\" to the mutual defence clause and NATO.  It comes after Volodymyr Zelenskyy warned that Russia could attack a NATO country within five years to test the alliance. The Ukrainian president made the comments in an interview with Sky News' chief presenter Mark Austin. But when asked if Russia could attack within months, Mr Zelenskyy said he did not \"believe [Putin] is ready\".

As Sir Keir pledged to boost the UK's defence and security spending to meet the goal, he told reporters on his way to the summit that it was \"pretty obvious we're living in volatile times, probably more volatile than most of us have lived through recently\". His government warned in a new National Security Strategy that it must \"actively prepare\" for the UK \"coming under direct threat, potentially in a wartime scenario\" for the first time in many years."

        "Content": "\n          Economics and data editor\n              @EdConwaySky\n  For more than a year, we have been tracking the flow of sanctioned items out of the UK and towards Russia. Electronic equipment, radar parts, components used to make aircraft and drones. These are all items that have been banned from going to Russia. For good reason: while Britain is far from a global manufacturing powerhouse, it nonetheless still makes certain prized components used to make machinery. In some hands, these components could be used for peaceful purposes, but they could also be used to wage war. All of which is why they are among the items sanctioned by G7 nations and banned from entry to Russia. A glance at the trade figures might lull you into thinking those sanctions have been extraordinarily successful. Look at the flows of these so-called \"dual use\" goods from the UK to Russia and they drop to zero shortly after the invasion of Ukraine and the imposition of those export bans. But that's not the whole story - because over precisely the same period, exports of those same items to countries neighbouring Russia have risen sharply. At this point, the data trail goes cold. As far as the statistics tell us, those components stay in the Caucasus and Central Asia. But there are two powerful pieces of evidence that suggest otherwise. The first is that we have travelled out to the border of Russia and filmed European-sanctioned goods (in this case cars, the hardest of all goods to disguise) passing across the border.  The second is that Ukrainian forces have repeatedly found weaponry and equipment containing European and British components inside them on the battlefield in their country. British technology has been used to kill Ukrainians - in spite of sanctions. That was one of the messages President Volodymyr Zelenskyy relayed in his interview with my colleague Mark Austin. So, in the wake of that interview, we revisited the databases to see if those flows of goods to Russian neighbours had slowed in recent months. But, far from slowing, they've accelerated. In the past nine months, the flow of dual-use goods to Russian neighbours has risen by an average of 9%, compared with the monthly average between the Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2022 and last June. Those flows are 111% higher than they were before the invasion. Read more:Analysis: Reasons for rhetoric from RussiaWestern brands remain on Russian shelvesPutin says 'Ukraine is ours' Nor are the flows of British goods to Russian neighbours the only trend suggesting these components are being trans-shipped via third countries. Look at exports of sanctioned items to the United Arab Emirates and Turkey and they are up by a similar proportion. In short: the evasion of sanctions continues much as it has done since the beginning of the war. For all the talk about the toughest sanctions regime in history, the reality on the ground is somewhat different."

The Ukrainian president spoke to chief presenter Mark Austin. Here are the five key takeaways from their discussion. NATO 'at risk of attack' Mr Zelenskyy said plans for NATO members to increase defence spending to 5% of GDP by 2035 are \"very slow\" and warned Russia could attack a NATO country within five years to test the alliance. \"We believe that, starting from 2030, Putin can have significantly greater capabilities,\" he said. \"Today, Ukraine is holding him up, he has no time to drill the army.\" But while Mr Zelenskyy conceded his ambition to join NATO \"isn't possible now\", he asserted long term \"NATO needs Ukrainians\". US support 'may be reduced' Asked about his views on the Israel-Iran conflict, and the impact of a wider Middle East war on Ukraine, Mr Zelenskyy accepted the \"political focus is changing\". \"This means that aid from partners, above all from the United States, may be reduced,\" he said. \"He [Putin] will increase strikes against us to use this opportunity, to use the fact that America's focus is changing over to the Middle East.\" On the subject of Mr Putin's close relationship with Iran, which has supplied Russia with attack drones, Mr Zelenskyy said: \"The Russians will feel the advantage on the battlefield and it will be difficult for us.\" Ukraine war latest: Kyiv launches attacks inside Russia Trump and Putin 'will never be friends' Mr Zelenskyy was sceptical about Mr Putin's relationship with Donald Trump. \"I truly don't know what relationship Trump has with Putin... but I am confident that President Trump understands that Ukrainians are allies to America, and the real existential enemy of America is Russia. \"They may be short-term partners, but they will never be friends.\" On his relationship with Mr Trump, Mr Zelenskyy was asked about whether he felt bullied by the US president during their spat in the Oval Office. 👉 Follow Trump100 on your podcast app 👈 \"I believe I conducted myself honestly. I really wanted America to be a strong partner... and to be honest, I was counting on that,\" he said. In a sign of potential frustration, the Ukrainian president added: \"Indeed, there were things that don't bring us closer to ending the war. There were some media... standing around us... talking about some small things like my suit. It's not the main thing.\" Read more:Putin: 'All of Ukraine is ours'Zelenskyy visits King CharlesAnalysis: Putin exploits Trump Putin and peace talks Mr Zelenskyy was clear he supported both a ceasefire and peace talks, adding that he would enter negotiations to understand \"if real compromises are possible and if there is a real way to end the war\". But he avoided directly saying whether he would be willing to surrender four annexed regions of Ukraine, as part of any peace deal. \"I don't believe that he [Putin] is interested in these four regions. He wants to occupy Ukraine. Putin wants more,\" he said. \"Putin is counting on a slow occupation of Ukraine, the reduction in European support and America standing back from this war completely... plus the removal of sanctions. \"But I think the strategy should be as follows: Pressure on Putin with political sanctions, with long-range weapons... to force him to the negotiating table.\" Russia 'using UK tech for missiles' On Monday, Mr Zelenskyy met Sir Keir Starmer and agreed to share battlefield technology, boosting Ukraine's drone production, which Mr Zelenskyy described as a \"strong step forward\". But he also spoke about the failure to limit Russia's access to crucial technology being used in military hardware. He said \"components for missiles and drones\" from countries \"including the UK\" were being used by Russian companies who were not subject to sanctions. \"It is vitally important for us, and we're handing these lists [of Russian companies] over to our partners and asking them to apply sanctions. Otherwise, the Russians will have missiles,\" he added."

Read the interview here But this is a big 24 hours for Zelenskyy, a meeting with Sir Keir Starmer in Downing Street, followed by the NATO summit in The Hague. When I sat down with Mr Zelenskyy in the last few hours, he had two main issues on his mind. Firstly, the proposed spending pledge by NATO countries of 5% of GDP by 2035 - that he said was too slow and warned that Putin would be ready with a new army within five years. He said the Russian leader would likely attack a NATO country within a few years to test Article 5.  Read more:Putin threatens nuclear strikeWestern brands on Russian shelves despite sanctions Then he was on to sanctions, which, he told me, were not working.

He also still insisted there would be no negotiations without a ceasefire. This war is not going well for Ukraine right now. Nearly three-and-a-half years into it, the fighting goes on, and Mr Zelenskyy appears to be a defiant president determined to see it through."

        "Content": "By Sky News Data and Forensics Unit  Israel and Iran began exchanging aerial bombardments after Israel's surprise attack early in the morning of 13 June. Since then, thousands of missiles have been sent by each side, and the US has also supported Israel in using bombers to strike Iran's main nuclear sites. This map shows the strikes in Iran, broken down by the type of attack. You can zoom in and click on individual points to see more detail, or click on parts of the key to focus in on specific types of targets. We will be keeping these maps updated each day, with the latest developments in the conflict. And here's a close-up on the capital, Tehran. The close proximity of key targets there means it has been the most heavily hit part of the country. Israel's sophisticated air defence system - consisting of the Iron Dome, David's Sling, Arrow System and American-made Patriot System, each of which respond to different sorts of missile, rocket and drone attacks - mean that most of the attacks on the country have been intercepted without causing any damage. Nonetheless, Iran has struck several targets in Israel, including many in and around Tel Aviv. \n                  Skies over Israel and Iran fall quiet as shaky ceasefire holds - but Trump faces scrutiny\n                 \n                  Leaks plunge success of 'Operation Midnight Hammer' into serious doubt\n                 \n                  Why hastily declared ceasefires tend to be fragile\n                 On 22 June, America joined in the attacks on Iran, using B2 bombers to drop several Massive Ordnance Penetrator \"bunker busters\" on Iran's key nuclear enrichment facilities. The bombs are about as long as a transit van, and weigh about as much as a standard five-door car. They were thought to be the only weapons on the planet capable of penetrating the Iranian sites which were buried deep underground. Donald Trump said the attacks had \"completely and totally obliterated\" the facilities, although experts have suggested that it could take more to destroy Iran's nuclear capacity entirely. \"This is a very well-developed, long-standing programme with a lot of latent expertise in the country,\" said Darya Dolzikova, a proliferation and nuclear security expert at RUSI, a UK defence and security thinktank. \"I don't think we're talking about a full elimination at this point, certainly not by military means.\" These satellite images show the impact of the attacks. A ceasefire was agreed between Israel and Iran on the morning of 24 June, but within hours, Israel had accused Iran of violating the deal and said it would \"respond forcefully... with intense strikes against regime targets in the heart of Tehran\".

The billionaire will marry Lauren Sanchez in the Italian city this week, and the couple will mark the occasion with three days of celebrations costing up to €48m (£41m). The venue where the couple will say their vows has been kept secret, but their wedding party has at the last minute been moved out of the city centre, Reuters news agency reports. It had been due to take place at the Scuola Grande della Misericordia but will now be held at the Arsenale, a source told Reuters. The new venue is a 14th-century complex surrounded by water and impossible to reach by land when bridges are raised. €48m price tag The wedding and its parts are expected to cost an eye-watering €40-48m (£34-£41m), Luca Zaia, the president of Venice's local government, said on Tuesday. This includes sizeable charity donations from the Amazon founder, including €1m (£850k) to Corila, a consortium that studies Venice's lagoon ecosystem, local media has reported.  90 private jets  The first private jets began landing at Venice airport on Tuesday and there will be around 90 in total, Mr Zaia said. \n  They won't all be arriving in Venice though, as some will land at the nearby Treviso and Verona airports. 250 guests  Five of the city's most luxurious hotels have been booked out to host an estimated 200-250 guests.  These include the celeb favourite Cipriani, where George and Amal Clooney married in 2014. 30 water taxis Attendees of course won't be hopping on public water buses to get around the city's many islands.  The wedding's organisers have booked at least 30 water taxis for them to use instead.  Amid the last-minute changes, guests, including Donald Trump's daughter, have begun arriving in Italy. Ivanka Trump and her husband, Jared Kushner, were seen boarding a water taxi at Venice airport on Tuesday, as was fashion designer Diane von Furstenberg. The move comes after weeks of protests from some local residents and pressure groups, who say Bezos and his fiancee are not welcome in the city. Read more: Why are activists protesting the wedding? The leader of the 'No Space for Bezos' campaign said: \"The news that Bezos has run away from the Misericordia is a great victory for us.\" The group has announced more protests for Saturday, believed to be the main day of celebrations, and pledged to make the event a \"nightmare\" for Bezos and his guests."

Climate crisis and civil protection minister Giannis Kefalogiannis said late on Monday that authorities were \"very seriously examining the possibility of an organised criminal act\". \"Whoever thinks that they can play with the lives of citizens and cause chaos with premeditated actions will be led to court,\" he added. \"Arson is a serious crime and will be dealt with as such.\" Mr Kefalogiannis said emergency services are tackling \"simultaneous fires in multiple, geographically unconnected parts of the island\", which he suggested \"cannot be considered coincidental\". Flames have been tearing through Chios's forest and agricultural land after fires started in three separate locations near the main town, which is also called Chios, on Sunday, before connecting to form one big blaze. Evacuation notifications were issued for two areas near Chios town on Monday morning. Push alerts were sent to mobile phones in the area urging people to evacuate 16 villages and settlements on the outskirts of the town. Wildfires are common during Greece's hot, dry summers, but authorities say climate change is fuelling bigger and more frequent blazes. Last year, hundreds of tourists and residents were forced to flee wildfires on the holiday island of Kos. In 2023, forest fires killed at least 20 people in the north of the country and forced 19,000 people to flee the island of Rhodes."

        "Content": "\n          US correspondent\n              @Stone_SkyNews\n  There is a critical question hanging over the events of the past few days. Behind the chest-thumping from Donald Trump, and the bewilderment beyond at his statecraft-by-social-media, doubts have now reached fever pitch about the success of the American bombing of Iran's nuclear sites. Leaks from the US Defence Department suggest the bunker busting bombs dropped on Iran's three nuclear enrichment sites might only have set the country's nuclear capabilities back by months. \"We were assuming that the damage was going to be much more significant than this assessment is finding,\" said one of three sources, speaking to NBC News. \"This assessment is already finding that these core pieces are still intact. That's a bad sign for the overall programme.\" NBC News has spoken to three sources - all of whom say that the initial assessment by the Defence Intelligence Agency has concluded that the US airstrikes were not as effective as Mr Trump claimed. Similar leaks were made to The New York Times, The Washington Post and CNN. \n                  In dramatic move, UK to buy F-35 stealth jets that can carry US nuclear warheads\n                 \n                  Do Israel and Iran know ‘what the f***’ they’re doing now?\n                 \n                  Donald Trump dodges commitment to founding NATO principle\n                 Follow latest developments in our live blog  Responding to the CNN leak, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said: \"This alleged assessment is flat-out wrong and was classified as 'top secret' but was still leaked to CNN by an anonymous, low-level loser in the intelligence community.\" She continued: \"The leaking of this alleged assessment is a clear attempt to demean President Trump, and discredit the brave fighter pilots who conducted a perfectly executed mission to obliterate Iran's nuclear programme. Everyone knows what happens when you drop 14 30,000lb bombs perfectly on their targets: total obliteration.\" In his address to the nation on Saturday night, Mr Trump had said: \"I can report to the world that the strikes were a spectacular military success. Iran's key nuclear enrichment facilities have been completely and totally obliterated.\"  US Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth has also dismissed the leaks, saying: \"Based on everything we have seen - and I've seen it all - our bombing campaign obliterated Iran's ability to create nuclear weapons. \"Our massive bombs hit exactly the right spot at each target - and worked perfectly.\" \"The impact of those bombs is buried under a mountain of rubble in Iran, so anyone who says the bombs were not devastating is just trying to undermine the president and the successful mission.\"  Battle Damage Assessments (BDAs) take a long time to be close to conclusive and require extensive intelligence analysis. Speaking to Sky News, former director of the CIA and top US General David Petraeus cautioned about drawing any conclusions at this stage. \"Well, the truth is, it is just too soon. And those who are leaking should know that it takes a long time to do the battle damage assessment. And those who have actually pushed back in very conclusive ways also probably should have wait for the full results,\" Gen Petraeus said. \"This is a very painstaking process. It's an effort by the overall intelligence community, not just Defence Intelligence Agency. In fact, the CIA would be the lead in this effort to mine all sources of intelligence, imagery, intelligence of all types, signals, cyber, even open-source intelligence.\" Read more analysis:There's one F word Trump fears mostCan Tehran regard Trump as trusted broker of peace?  Beyond the debate over the extent of the damage, questions remain over whether Iran might have managed to move equipment including centrifuges. Critically too, the whereabouts of about 400kg of highly enriched uranium is unknown. The classified assessment of the military's operation in Iran has been transmitted to Congress and has been viewed by some senators in a secure location, according to two sources with direct knowledge of the situation. \"I've reviewed the classified material,\" Democratic Party Senator Tim Kaine, a member of the Armed Services Committee, said. \"I'm a little bit disappointed that my colleagues went and looked at it and mainly started talking about it publicly. That's not we're supposed to do with a classified report,\" he added.  Speaking on Sunday to NBC's Meet The Press, Israel's ambassador to the UN Danny Danon insisted Iran's nuclear capability had been dramatically set back. \"I think it's still very early to jump into conclusions. We have to wait for the assessment. I can tell you one thing for sure. If you look where Iran was 12 days ago and where they are today, you understand that both Israel and the US were able to degrade the capabilities, push them back decades, and if we had an imminent threat, it doesn't exist anymore.\""

        "Content": "\n          US correspondent\n              @jamesmatthewsky\n  Failure – it's the F word Donald Trump fears most. Hence the early morning rant from a president, F for frustrated. The day before had seen head-spinning developments in which a ceasefire between Israel and Iran turned on a Truth Social post. If it felt fragile, that's how it appeared overnight. There were exchanges between both sides beyond the deadline, and the president woke frustrated. An unlikely diplomatic result looked exactly that. Trump's four-lettered fury was aimed primarily at Israel, which on Tuesday morning gave the appearance of an ally that had reeled him into the fight and wasn't letting go. It also leant into doubts around Trump's influence over Israeli actions. \n                  Leaks plunge success of 'Operation Midnight Hammer' into serious doubt\n                 \n                  In dramatic move, UK to buy F-35 stealth jets that can carry US nuclear warheads\n                 \n                  Do Israel and Iran know ‘what the f***’ they’re doing now?\n                 If this process is heading towards nuclear negotiations between the US and Iran, Trump doesn't need questions surrounding his relationship with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Tehran needs to believe Trump can tighten the leash. It will have been comforted by his remarks on board Air Force One, from where he called Netanyahu. Speaking to the travelling media, Trump said he didn't want to see regime change in Iran, having floated support for the idea last week. 👉 Follow Trump100 on your podcast app 👈 Israel's prime minister's office issued a statement that spoke of having \"achieved all the war's objectives\". The wording speaks to a move beyond aggression. Time will tell, and this ceasefire feels fragile still, but it'll do for Trump for now, the self-styled peacemaker making peace one social media post at a time. He is strengthened by the success of his diplomacy, a fact laid bare - where else? - on Truth Social. Read more:How much damage did the US inflict on Iran?Can Tehran trust Trump as a broker of peace? As he flew towards the NATO summit, Trump posted a message from the NATO secretary general, Mark Rutte. It's unclear if Rutte knew it would be published, but it's abundantly clear he's a man with lips puckered as the US president swaggers towards the gathering. Referring to NATO countries' commitment to increase their defence spending to 5% of GDP, he wrote: \"Donald, you have driven us to a really, really important moment for America and Europe and the world. \"You will achieve something NO American president in decades could get done.\" The effusive praise speaks to power enhanced for the US president as he prepares to attend the NATO gathering. His stature is reinforced by his most recent result… as long as it lasts."

        "Content": "\n          Culture and entertainment reporter\n              @gemmapeplow\n Prosecutors and defence lawyers have rested their cases in the sex-trafficking trial of Sean \"Diddy\" Combs, bringing more than six weeks of testimony against the hip-hop mogul to a close. The high-profile trial has heard from more than 30 witnesses, including the rapper's ex-girlfriend Cassie Ventura, as well as former employees of his company Bad Boy Entertainment, male escorts, law enforcement officers and hotel staff. But one person jurors won't hear from is Combs himself. Confirming this to Judge Arun Subramanian, the rapper said he had discussed the issue of testifying \"thoroughly\" with his team and made the decision not to give evidence. He also thanked the judge and told him he was doing an \"excellent job\". Diddy trial: As it happened After the prosecution rested, the defence team moved for the judge to acquit the 55-year-old - a fairly standard move - saying attorneys for the government had not provided evidence to prove any of the charges filed. They then presented a brief case themselves, submitting more text messages as evidence to show Combs and his girlfriends were in loving, consensual relationships, and making a few stipulations about testimony, but calling no witnesses. This lasted for less than an hour. They have previously conceded Combs has been violent in the past, something he is \"not proud\" of, but said this did not make him a sex trafficker. Sean 'Diddy' Combs is charged with one count of racketeering conspiracy, two charges of sex-trafficking, and two charges of transportation to engage in prostitution. He has pleaded not guilty to all charges and has strenuously denied all allegations of sexual abuse. The hip-hop mogul's defence team has described him as \"a complicated man\" but say the case is not. They have conceded Combs could be violent and that jurors might not condone his proclivity for \"kinky sex\". However, they argue this was a consensual \"swingers\" lifestyle and was not illegal. Combs has remained in jail without bail since he was arrested in New York in September last year. Throughout the trial, defence lawyers have made their case for exoneration through their questioning of witnesses called by the prosecution, including several who gave evidence reluctantly or after they were granted immunity to testify. Prosecutors argue Combs coerced and forced Cassie and another former girlfriend, who testified under the pseudonym Jane, into \"freak off\" sex sessions with male escorts, and used his business empire to facilitate these, as well as drug use, and cover up bad behaviour. During the first week of the trial, Cassie, 38, spent four days giving evidence. Heavily pregnant at the time, she told jurors she felt pressured to take part in hundreds of \"freak offs\" with male sex workers as Combs watched. She told the court they became so frequent during their relationship, which began in 2007 and ended in 2018, that they were \"like a job\", and she had barely any time for her own career. The singer and musician gave birth two weeks after her testimony, her friend and former stylist confirmed as he gave evidence himself in court. Jane testified for six days about similar sexual performances, which Combs referred to as \"hotel nights\", \"wild king nights\" or \"debauchery\" with her, the court heard. Like Cassie, she said she felt coerced into engaging in them because she loved the music star and wanted to please him. Jane dated Combs on and off from early 2021 to his arrest in 2024. Jurors have been shown several recordings of these sex sessions, lasting more than 40 minutes in total. The footage was shown on monitors and jurors used headphones, keeping it private from the media and members of the public in court. In her opening statement, defence lawyer Teny Geragos called the videos \"powerful evidence that the sexual conduct in this case was consensual and not based on coercion\". Read more:Everything you need to know about the trialThe rise and fall of Sean 'Diddy' CombsWhat we learned from Cassie's testimony The trial also heard from Mia, another alleged victim who testified under a pseudonym. Mia was a former employee of Combs, who told the court he sexually assaulted her on several occasions in the years she worked for him. She had never told anyone about the alleged abuse until the investigation into Combs, she said, telling the court she was ashamed. \"I was going to die with this,\" she said, becoming tearful on the stand. \"I didn't want anyone to know ever.\" The trial has been eventful, with one juror dismissed and replaced by an alternate after it emerged he had given conflicting evidence about where he lives. The judge said he had \"serious concerns\" that not being truthful about this could potentially mean he wanted to be on the jury for a particular reason. And at one point, Combs was warned by the judge for nodding enthusiastically toward jurors during a section of cross-examination by his lawyers. The judge said he could be excluded from the trial if it happened again. Court is not in session on Wednesday. The trial continues on Thursday, when closing statements from the legal teams will begin."

The clause asserts the principle of collective and mutual defence, meaning an attack against one NATO ally is considered an attack against all members. It came as the US president spoke to reporters on Air Force One on his way to the NATO summit in The Hague, the Netherlands, and was asked about his commitment to Article 5. He replied that it \"depends on your definition\" of it, while adding that he was \"committed to being their friend\". Mr Trump added: \"You know, I've become friends with many of those leaders, and I'm committed to helping them. \"I'm committed to saving lives. I'm committed to life and safety, and I'm going to give you an exact definition. When I get there.

But Mr Trump's comments cast renewed doubt on his willingness to protect the US's allies. However, NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte said he had \"no doubt\" that the US was \"totally committed\" to the mutual defence clause and NATO.  It comes after Volodymyr Zelenskyy warned that Russia could attack a NATO country within five years to test the alliance.

As Sir Keir pledged to boost the UK's defence and security spending to meet the goal, he told reporters on his way to the summit that it was \"pretty obvious we're living in volatile times, probably more volatile than most of us have lived through recently\". His government warned in a new National Security Strategy that it must \"actively prepare\" for the UK \"coming under direct threat, potentially in a wartime scenario\" for the first time in many years."

        "Content": "\n          US correspondent\n              @jamesmatthewsky\n  These days, peace is a post on social media. On Donald Trump's Truth Social site, it came in two parts. Part one read: \"CONGRATULATIONS WORLD, IT'S TIME FOR PEACE.\" The Magna Carta it wasn't, but it was a peace treaty for our times - a US president announcing there would be no retaliation against Iran's missile attack. An anxious world watching for US bombers returning to Iranian skies could cool its jets - and the primetime president could feel vindicated, having enjoyed strategic success. Trump has tweaked the politics and military landscape around Iran to suit US interests, without a single American life lost. He had framed US intervention in Iran as an effort to prevent a \"forever\" foreign war, not to provoke it, and he is sitting pretty, following ugly predictions he'd be sucked into conflict. Live updates: Three killed as Iranian missiles strike Israel \n                  Leaks plunge success of 'Operation Midnight Hammer' into serious doubt\n                 \n                  Do Israel and Iran know ‘what the f***’ they’re doing now?\n                 \n                  Donald Trump ordered Israel to halt strike on Iran in call to Benjamin Netanyahu\n                 Then, on Truth Social, there was peace \"part two\". A couple of hours after announcing non-retaliation, Trump wrote the sequel: \"Ceasefire.\" He posted: \"CONGRATULATIONS TO EVERYONE!\" - saying a \"complete and total\" ceasefire had been fully agreed between Israel and Iran. Quite the day of problem-solving for the self-styled \"peacemaker-in-chief\". Quite the day of problems unsolved too - time will tell. As deadlines loomed, neither Israel nor Iran appeared fully committed to the Trump script, and fresh missiles were fired overnight. Daytime will test the durability of a ceasefire. There are motivations on both sides to continue a conflict in which both see the other as an existential threat. Can Tehran regard Donald Trump as a trusted broker of peace when he floated the idea of regime change in Iran, as pursued by Israel? Can Israel be convinced to pull back on its military advantage when its instinct will be to reinforce superiority and undermine an Iranian rebuild? Trump's influence will be tested, as ever, when he flies to a NATO summit in The Netherlands today. For him, it can be a difficult crowd and one for whom he remains a mystery. A positive result in the Middle East will help to confound their curiosity, for the better. It's the most important day for Donald Trump since the last one."

The billionaire will marry Lauren Sanchez in the Italian city this week, and the couple will mark the occasion with three days of celebrations costing up to €48m (£41m). The venue where the couple will say their vows has been kept secret, but their wedding party has at the last minute been moved out of the city centre, Reuters news agency reports. It had been due to take place at the Scuola Grande della Misericordia but will now be held at the Arsenale, a source told Reuters. The new venue is a 14th-century complex surrounded by water and impossible to reach by land when bridges are raised. €48m price tag The wedding and its parts are expected to cost an eye-watering €40-48m (£34-£41m), Luca Zaia, the president of Venice's local government, said on Tuesday. This includes sizeable charity donations from the Amazon founder, including €1m (£850k) to Corila, a consortium that studies Venice's lagoon ecosystem, local media has reported.  90 private jets  The first private jets began landing at Venice airport on Tuesday and there will be around 90 in total, Mr Zaia said. \n  They won't all be arriving in Venice though, as some will land at the nearby Treviso and Verona airports. 250 guests  Five of the city's most luxurious hotels have been booked out to host an estimated 200-250 guests.  These include the celeb favourite Cipriani, where George and Amal Clooney married in 2014. 30 water taxis Attendees of course won't be hopping on public water buses to get around the city's many islands.  The wedding's organisers have booked at least 30 water taxis for them to use instead.  Amid the last-minute changes, guests, including Donald Trump's daughter, have begun arriving in Italy. Ivanka Trump and her husband, Jared Kushner, were seen boarding a water taxi at Venice airport on Tuesday, as was fashion designer Diane von Furstenberg. The move comes after weeks of protests from some local residents and pressure groups, who say Bezos and his fiancee are not welcome in the city. Read more: Why are activists protesting the wedding? The leader of the 'No Space for Bezos' campaign said: \"The news that Bezos has run away from the Misericordia is a great victory for us.\" The group has announced more protests for Saturday, believed to be the main day of celebrations, and pledged to make the event a \"nightmare\" for Bezos and his guests."

Electronic equipment, radar parts, components used to make aircraft and drones. These are all items that have been banned from going to Russia. For good reason: while Britain is far from a global manufacturing powerhouse, it nonetheless still makes certain prized components used to make machinery. In some hands, these components could be used for peaceful purposes, but they could also be used to wage war. All of which is why they are among the items sanctioned by G7 nations and banned from entry to Russia. A glance at the trade figures might lull you into thinking those sanctions have been extraordinarily successful. Look at the flows of these so-called \"dual use\" goods from the UK to Russia and they drop to zero shortly after the invasion of Ukraine and the imposition of those export bans. But that's not the whole story - because over precisely the same period, exports of those same items to countries neighbouring Russia have risen sharply. At this point, the data trail goes cold. As far as the statistics tell us, those components stay in the Caucasus and Central Asia. But there are two powerful pieces of evidence that suggest otherwise. The first is that we have travelled out to the border of Russia and filmed European-sanctioned goods (in this case cars, the hardest of all goods to disguise) passing across the border.  The second is that Ukrainian forces have repeatedly found weaponry and equipment containing European and British components inside them on the battlefield in their country. British technology has been used to kill Ukrainians - in spite of sanctions. That was one of the messages President Volodymyr Zelenskyy relayed in his interview with my colleague Mark Austin. So, in the wake of that interview, we revisited the databases to see if those flows of goods to Russian neighbours had slowed in recent months. But, far from slowing, they've accelerated. In the past nine months, the flow of dual-use goods to Russian neighbours has risen by an average of 9%, compared with the monthly average between the Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2022 and last June. Those flows are 111% higher than they were before the invasion. Read more:Analysis: Reasons for rhetoric from RussiaWestern brands remain on Russian shelvesPutin says 'Ukraine is ours' Nor are the flows of British goods to Russian neighbours the only trend suggesting these components are being trans-shipped via third countries. Look at exports of sanctioned items to the United Arab Emirates and Turkey and they are up by a similar proportion. In short: the evasion of sanctions continues much as it has done since the beginning of the war. For all the talk about the toughest sanctions regime in history, the reality on the ground is somewhat different."

        "Content": "\n          Business and economics reporter\n              @SkyNewsBiz\n Global oil costs have fallen back sharply amid hopes that a ceasefire between Israel and Iran will end the threat of disruption to crucial energy flows for the world economy. The cost of a barrel of Brent crude, the international benchmark, was as high as $81 late on Sunday night as financial markets opened in Asia. It was the first reaction to news of the US bombing of Iran's nuclear facilities over the weekend and built on gains seen widely since Israel first began its strikes 10 days previously. Israel-Iran live updates: Trump swears as he rages at both countries But prices came down on Monday evening after it became clear that Iran's retaliation, through missile attacks on a US base in Qatar, were a mere face-saving exercise due to the Americans being pre-warned by Tehran. Drops of more than 7% in US trading were followed by a further 4% fall on Tuesday, with Brent currently standing at $68. It remains, however, $5 a barrel higher on where it started the month and reflects the continuing, possible, threat to shipping in the key Strait of Hormuz which handles 20% of global oil and 30% of natural gas supplies. \n                  The evidence that Russia sanctions evasion has intensified\n                 \n                  Money blog: Bank offers new 7.1% savings rate; warning issued over Glastonbury tickets\n                 \n                  Amazon to invest £40bn in UK - with more warehouses and thousands of new jobs \n                 The main concerns in the energy market were over potential disruption to liquefied natural gas (LNG) deliveries as it remains in high demand. Europe is yet to fully restock following the harsh end to last winter which drained storage levels. Read more:'They don't know what the f*** they're doing': Trump rages at Iran and Israel  As such, prices had already been driven up by steep competition from Asia for Gulf supplies. UK day-ahead natural gas prices were more than 25% up in the month, as of Monday, and have not fallen as sharply as oil costs. Financial services specialists have pointed to upwards shifts in the risk premiums facing cargo, especially tankers, due to the conflict. Analysts had warned last week that a sustained Middle East war with disruption to energy shipping risked a fresh cost of living crisis similar to that seen after Russia's invasion of Ukraine in 2022.  Only a sustained ceasefire is likely to bring the additional costs seen in wholesale prices down. Stock markets have also reacted positively to the ceasefire development though the FTSE 100 failed to capitalise on the improved risk sentiment due to its exposure to energy and precious metals stocks. It ended the day flat - lagging gains of more than 1.6% and 1% in Germany and France respectively. Commenting on the moves, Russ Mould, AJ Bell's investment director, said: \"The markets will be watching closely to see if the cessation in hostilities is maintained and for Iran's next move - amid noises from that side that no such ceasefire has been agreed. \"Defensive stocks, oil producers and precious metals miners were all under pressure in early trading. \"Gold slipped back as its safe-haven attributes were less in demand. This rather clipped the wings of the FTSE 100 given its relatively heavy weightings in these areas and saw the index underperform its European counterparts. \"On the flipside, travel stocks moved higher, both on the implications for fuel costs but also as the potential hit to foreign travel appetite that might have resulted from any further escalation of Middle East tensions seems to have been swerved.\""

The online shopping giant will build two huge fulfilment centres in the East Midlands, which it expects to open in 2027. The exact locations are still to be revealed. Two others - in Hull and Northampton - were previously announced and are set to be finished this year and in 2026 respectively, with 2,000 jobs expected at each site.

Two new buildings will also go up at its corporate headquarters in east London, while other investment includes new delivery stations, upgrading its transport network and redeveloping Bray Film Studios in Berkshire - which it bought last year. The £40bn figure also includes most of the £8bn announced in 2024 for building and maintaining UK data centres, as well as staff wages and benefits.

The billionaire will marry Lauren Sanchez in the Italian city this week, and the couple will mark the occasion with three days of celebrations costing up to €48m (£41m). The venue where the couple will say their vows has been kept secret, but their wedding party has at the last minute been moved out of the city centre, Reuters news agency reports. It had been due to take place at the Scuola Grande della Misericordia but will now be held at the Arsenale, a source told Reuters. The new venue is a 14th-century complex surrounded by water and impossible to reach by land when bridges are raised. €48m price tag The wedding and its parts are expected to cost an eye-watering €40-48m (£34-£41m), Luca Zaia, the president of Venice's local government, said on Tuesday. This includes sizeable charity donations from the Amazon founder, including €1m (£850k) to Corila, a consortium that studies Venice's lagoon ecosystem, local media has reported.  90 private jets  The first private jets began landing at Venice airport on Tuesday and there will be around 90 in total, Mr Zaia said. \n  They won't all be arriving in Venice though, as some will land at the nearby Treviso and Verona airports. 250 guests  Five of the city's most luxurious hotels have been booked out to host an estimated 200-250 guests.  These include the celeb favourite Cipriani, where George and Amal Clooney married in 2014. 30 water taxis Attendees of course won't be hopping on public water buses to get around the city's many islands.  The wedding's organisers have booked at least 30 water taxis for them to use instead.  Amid the last-minute changes, guests, including Donald Trump's daughter, have begun arriving in Italy. Ivanka Trump and her husband, Jared Kushner, were seen boarding a water taxi at Venice airport on Tuesday, as was fashion designer Diane von Furstenberg. The move comes after weeks of protests from some local residents and pressure groups, who say Bezos and his fiancee are not welcome in the city. Read more: Why are activists protesting the wedding? The leader of the 'No Space for Bezos' campaign said: \"The news that Bezos has run away from the Misericordia is a great victory for us.\" The group has announced more protests for Saturday, believed to be the main day of celebrations, and pledged to make the event a \"nightmare\" for Bezos and his guests."

        "Content": "\n          Political reporter\n              @alexrogerssky\n  Sir Keir Starmer has reaffirmed his desire to push through controversial benefit cuts, despite growing criticism from Labour figures including Sir Sadiq Khan. The prime minister said there was a \"clear moral case\" for the reforms, which aim to slash £5bn a year from the welfare bill by 2030. He defended the measures after more than 100 of his own MPs signed an amendment that could effectively kill off the proposed legislation. PM warns UK must prepare for war at home - follow latest Many Labour MPs initially indicated they would back the proposals in principle, but support has ebbed away over recent months over warnings about the impact the cuts could have on the most vulnerable. Around 119 Labour MPs have signed a reasoned amendment to oppose the government's proposals - which, if passed, would effectively kill the legislation. Now, Sir Sadiq, the mayor of London, has become the most senior Labour figure to call for a \"rethink\" of the proposals, which he warned would \"destroy [the] financial safety net\" for \"too many disabled Londoners\". But speaking earlier to Sky News' political editor Beth Rigby from the NATO summit at The Hague, the prime minister said the welfare system needed reform and was \"not working for anyone\". He said the vote planned for Tuesday was not a confidence vote in his leadership but on the need to reform the system.  \"I think most colleagues do accept the case for reform,\" he said. \"We've got to get on and make that reform because the options are: leave the system as it is, trusting people and not helping them, that's not a Labour option. The Labour option is to reform it and make it fit for the future. So we're going to press ahead with these reforms.\" Benefit cuts will 'destroy financial safety nets' Following the comments from the prime minister, Sir Sadiq said he believed that \"more must be done to support people\" back into work and off benefits, as this was \"vital for a healthy and prosperous London\". But he also warned: \"What we can't do is take away the vital safety net that so many vulnerable and disabled Londoners rely upon. \"Having looked at the analysis of the government's plans, the impact on London will be substantial, and for too many disabled Londoners it will destroy their financial safety net.\" Sir Sadiq called on the government to \"urgently think again\" and said it must \"look again at the potential hardship these changes will force on thousands of vulnerable and disabled Londoners\". He also urged ministers to bring in additional employment and training support \"as soon as possible\" and \"before anyone starts to lose their benefits\". Welfare system 'unsustainable' Sir Keir spoke to reporters on the way to the summit about the reforms, saying there were around 1,000 people a day signing up for personal independence payment (PIP) - equivalent to the size of the population of Leicester. \"That is not a system that can be left unreformed, not least because it's unsustainable, and therefore you won't have a welfare system for those that need it in the future,\" he added. \"So those that care about a future welfare system have to answer the question - how do you reform what you've got to make sure it's sustainable for the future?'\" Introduced in March, the government's welfare bill outlines proposals to make it harder for some disabled people to qualify for PIP while also cutting universal credit, another benefit. Political reporter The most controversial elements of the government's welfare bill are changes to PIP and Universal Credit. PIP is money for people who have extra care needs or mobility needs as a result of a disability. People who claim it - some of whom are in work - are awarded points depending on their ability to do certain activities, such as washing and preparing food, and this influences how much they will receive. Under the plans, from November 2026, people will need to score a minimum of four points in at least one activity to qualify for the daily living element of PIP - instead of fewer points across a broader range of tasks the person needs help with. Currently, the standard rate is given if people score between eight and 11 points overall, while the enhanced rate applies from 12 points.\n\nThe changes do not affect the mobility component of PIP. And from April next year, the health element of Universal Credit will be frozen in cash terms for existing claimants at £97 per week until 2029/2030. For new claimants, the health element of Universal Credit will be reduced to £50 per week. \n\nHowever, ministers point to the fact that the Universal Credit standard allowance will increase from £92 per week in 2025-26 to £106 per week by 2029-30. Overall, 3.2 million families are expected to lose an average of £1,720 by the end of 2030 due to the changes.\n\nHowever, the government has stressed that these figures do not take into account the £1bn that is being put towards helping the long-term sick and disabled back into work.\n\n\n It is these changes that have caused the most anxiety among MPs. \n\nAs one Labour MP told Sky News: \"If the thrust of the policy is getting people into work, how does cutting support for people in work, work? \"The thrust of the proposals is right but cutting PIP and Universal Credit isn't about getting people back into work, it's about saving money.\" The reasoned amendment calls on the government to delay the proposals pending an assessment of the impact of the PIP cuts. It also cites concern about the government's own figures which show 250,000 people could be pushed into poverty as a result of the changes and the lack of a formal consultation with disabled people. More from Sky News:Is PM going to have to give in again?UK must 'actively prepare' for war potential One Labour rebel told Sky News there was a \"broad sense of unease across all levels of the parliamentary party\". \"Almost everyone thinks there needs to be reform and there are a lot of good things in the bill, but elements need more thought and explanation if they are going to proceed,\" they said. \"Unless those issues are revised, or much better explained and justified, I don't think there is enough support for the measures. People are really worried there is a rush to do this and that we might sleepwalk into this as we have done with other issues.\" On Tuesday, Downing Street suggested the vote would still go ahead, despite the concerns of some MPs - including influential chairs of parliamentary select committees."

The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) has laid out potential remedies Google may have to make, including allowing people to easily switch search engines through a legal requirement for so-called \"choice screens\". Also being considered is ensuring people can transfer their browser history to another provider, and a requirement for transparency over search result ordering and inclusion in AI-generated summaries. Money blog: Warning issued over Glastonbury tickets The CMA has also proposed designating the tech giant with \"strategic market status\", which would give the regulator greater control over how Google operates search services. Why is this happening? It's all being done to give consumers \"more choice and control\" and to unlock \"greater opportunities for innovation across the UK tech sector and broader economy\", the CMA's chief executive, Sarah Cardell, said. The average person in the UK makes five to 10 searches a day, the CMA said, with Google's services \"critical\" for more than 200,000 UK businesses, which rely on the company to reach customers. \"Our investigation so far suggests there are ways to make these markets more open, competitive and innovative,\" Ms Cardell said.  Possible measures and concerns outlined by the watchdog do not mean Google is guilty of anti-competitive practices. Nor does the \"strategic market status\" designation, given due to its dominant position in search and advertising. Were the CMA to go through with the measures, \"the outcome could have significant implications for businesses and consumers in the UK\", Google's senior director for competition, Oliver Bethell, said. \"This announcement presents clear challenges to critical areas of our business in the UK.\" \"We're concerned that the scope of the CMA's considerations remains broad and unfocused, with a range of interventions being considered before any evidence has been provided,\" the firm added. The announcement on Tuesday morning is a continuation of the investigation first announced in January. What next? A final decision on whether to apply the remedies and designate Google as having \"strategic market status\" will be made in October. But in the second half of 2026, the CMA said it planned to consider actions to address \"more complex\" concerns. These include the impact of Google's bargaining position on internet publishers, its treatment of rival specialised search firms, and transparency and control in search advertising.

In March, the Treasury said the fund would be given a new strategic steer to enable it to take on higher-risk projects in clean energy, advanced manufacturing, digital technologies and transport.

By directing tens of billions of pounds into the UK's industrial strengths, we'll deliver the high-skilled, high-paid jobs of the future in every corner of the country.\" Other candidates are said to be in the frame to succeed Mr Flint if Mr Holbourn does not get appointed to the role. The Treasury did not respond to a request for comment, while NatWest declined to comment on Mr Holbourn's behalf."

        "Content": "\n          Security and Defence Editor\n              @haynesdeborah\n The UK will buy at least 12 F-35 stealth jets that can carry nuclear warheads in the most significant strengthening of its nuclear capability in a generation, the government has said. Today, Sir Keir Starmer will tell a summit of NATO allies in The Hague that the new squadron will join an alliance mission that can be armed with US nuclear weapons. The dramatic move will doubtless draw condemnation and concern from Russia and China. But it comes at a time of growing global insecurity - and as the prime minister and his European and Canadian counterparts scramble to convince Donald Trump they are serious about bolstering their ability to defend Europe, instead of overly relying on the United States. The US president, a long-standing NATO sceptic, raised questions about whether he would uphold the alliance's founding Article 5 principle - that an attack on one is an attack on all - before he even arrived in the Dutch city last night.  An urgent need to keep Mr Trump on side has prompted NATO allies to agree to increase spending on defence and national resilience to a new target of 5% of GDP by 2035. As part of this push to rearm, Sir Keir will give the Royal Air Force the ability to carry airborne nuclear warheads for the first time since the 1990s. \n                  More Britons than ever struggling to make ends meet, report warns\n                 \n                  Welfare versus warfare - the PM has made his choice but faces the hardest fight of his premiership\n                 \n                  What's NATO without America? \n                 \"In an era of radical uncertainty we can no longer take peace for granted,\" he said. \"These F-35 dual capable aircraft will herald a new era for our world-leading Royal Air Force and deter hostile threats that threaten the UK and our allies. \"The UK's commitment to NATO is unquestionable, as is the alliance's contribution to keeping the UK safe and secure, but we must all step up to protect the Euro-Atlantic area for generations to come.\"  It was not immediately clear when the F-35 jets would be bought or how much they will cost, but the new squadron will be part of a NATO-led nuclear deterrence mission. That is in contrast to the UK's national nuclear deterrence, based on a fleet of four nuclear-armed submarines, though they too are used to defend the whole of the alliance. Mark Rutte, the head of NATO, applauded the plan - saying: \"The UK has declared its nuclear deterrent to NATO for many decades, ​and I strongly welcome today's announcement that the UK will now also join NATO's nuclear mission and procure the F-35A. \"This is yet another robust British contribution to NATO.\" Aircraft operated by a small number of NATO countries, including Belgium, Germany and the Netherlands, are cleared to carry US-provided nuclear weapons in a war. The RAF and the Royal Navy already operate F-35B jets that can fly off Britain's two aircraft carriers, but they are not equipped to drop nuclear warheads. The new planes will be the F-35A variant, operated by the air force, that take off from land but can fly further and be armed with nuclear or conventional weapons. The government said they would all be based together at RAF Marham in Norfolk. The government has long planned to purchase a total of 138 F-35 aircraft, but has so far only acquired around three dozen - seven years since the first jets entered service. The decision to purchase 12 of the A-variant does not mean extra aircraft. It just means a diversification in the fleet - something the RAF has long been pushing for - though it's a decision some in the Royal Navy have long pushed back against, believing it would reduce even further the number of the B-version that operate from their carriers. Read more:PM warns of 'era of radical uncertainty'Podcast - What is NATO without America?  The government described the plan to purchase nuclear-capable aircraft as the \"biggest strengthening of the UK's nuclear posture in a generation\". Defence Secretary John Healey said a major defence review published earlier in the month highlighted new nuclear risks. \"It recommended a new UK role in our collective defence and deterrence through a NATO-first approach,\" he said. However, the public version of the Strategic Defence Review stopped short of making any specific recommendation. It merely said \"the UK must explore how to support the US and its NATO allies in strengthening extended deterrence across the Euro-Atlantic\". The F-35 aircraft is made by the US defence giant Lockheed Martin, but the British defence company BAE Systems is also a key contributor. The order will support 20,000 jobs in the F-35 programme in the UK."

        "Content": "\n          Political reporter\n              @WillCharley1\n  Foreign criminals in prisons across England and Wales will be deported at an earlier point in their sentence under new government plans. The proposed legislation, to be presented in Parliament today, comes as part of efforts to tackle prison overcrowding. Currently, foreign inmates with no right to stay in the UK are sent back to their home country after serving half of their sentence. But under the plans, they will instead be removed after just 30% of their term. The measure would apply to those given determinate sentences - fixed maximum terms in prison that offenders do not necessarily serve all of behind bars. It would not apply to those convicted of terrorism or terror-related offences. The Ministry of Justice (MoJ) estimates that, combined with other upcoming reforms, some foreign prisoners would end up serving only 10% of their sentence in England and Wales, down from about 20 to 25% currently. The law is also being tweaked so they can be deported 48 months before the end of their custodial sentence, rather than 18 months before. The changes will free up an estimated 500 cells per year, with around 12% of the prison population currently made up of foreign offenders, according to the government.  The MoJ said the proposals should also save the taxpayer millions of pounds, with the average prison place costing £54,000 per year. Justice Secretary Shabana Mahmood said: \"With prisons close to bursting, I'm clear we shouldn't be giving bed and board to foreign criminals with no right to be here. \"These changes will get more of them on planes out of the country much sooner, saving taxpayers' money and keeping our streets safe as part of our Plan for Change. \"This government's message is crystal clear - if you come here and break our laws, you'll be sent packing in record time.\"  The proposals follow calls from the Conservatives for a change in the law to give the government the power to deport all foreign criminals. The MoJ said the measure would be a discretionary power, meaning that some prisoners may be refused permission to be deported in certain circumstances, such as if there was clear evidence they were planning further crime. The government hopes the shake-up will come into effect in September, if it is approved in Parliament. Ministers have repeatedly warned that the prison system is overcrowded, overstretched and understaffed. Last month, Ms Mahmood announced the government would be adopting a range of measures to ease prison overcrowding, following an independent review by former Tory justice secretary David Gauke."

The Tory leader told Sky News she would be asking for three commitments from Sir Keir Starmer, if he wants to use Conservative votes to pass the reforms to disability benefits, which have triggered an unprecedented rebellion of more than 100 Labour MPs. Ms Badenoch said: \"I'm just making it very clear to Keir Starmer that if he will make commitments at the despatch box to meet our conditions which are to reduce the welfare budget, to get people into work and not to have tax rises, then we can support his bill. \"The bill is a bit of a mess. It needs some work. It looks like it's been rushed for Rachel [Reeves] to fix other problems that they've got. But our welfare budget is far too high, and we really need to bring it down.\" PM warns UK must prepare for war at home - follow latest The prospect of the bill passing on Conservative votes would outrage Labour MPs. An amendment they have tabled says they cannot support the bill because it would drive disabled people into poverty, and they are concerned about whether people losing benefits would find work. \n                  Latest polling says if an election was held tomorrow Reform UK would win a majority\n                 \n                  Is Kemi Badenoch's grooming gangs outrage just politics or does she really care?\n                 \n                  Kemi Badenoch: ECHR has become 'sword used to attack democratic decisions'\n                 Around 119 Labour MPs have now signed the amendment, while Sadiq Khan has become the most senior Labour figure to call for a \"rethink\". The mayor of London has warned that the proposed cuts would \"destroy [the] financial safety net\" for \"too many disabled Londonders\". Welfare Secretary Liz Kendall has tried to reassure Labour MPs about the changes. But the rebels are hoping the government will water down their proposals in order to get Labour support. The prime minister, speaking at a NATO summit in The Hague on Tuesday, insisted the government would press ahead. Keir Starmer told Sky News: \"We've got to get on and make that reform because the options are: leave the system as it is, trusting people and not helping them, that's not a Labour option. The Labour option is to reform it and make it fit for the future. So we're going to press ahead with these reforms.\"  A vote is looming next Tuesday with Labour MPs deeply concerned about the changes which will see 370,000 current PIP claimants lose benefit, and affect 3 million people in total. The rebels hope the government will climb down. One of them, Neil Duncan-Jordan, the MP for Poole, told Sky News that relying on Conservative votes \"is not a good look for any government\". He added: \"If you can't rely on your own party, I think you're in a serious place.\" Responding to Ms Badenoch's offer, a Labour spokesperson said the government was \"elected to deliver change\" and that it's \"prepared to take on the challenges holding the UK back\". They added: \"We're fixing the abysmal mess the Tories left behind, and MPs can either vote to keep a broken failed welfare system that writes people off, or they can vote to start fixing it. \"Next week's bill is a test for the leader of the opposition as to whether her party has learned anything at all by being roundly rejected by Britain.\""

The prime minister said there was a \"clear moral case\" for the reforms, which aim to slash £5bn a year from the welfare bill by 2030. He defended the measures after more than 100 of his own MPs signed an amendment that could effectively kill off the proposed legislation. PM warns UK must prepare for war at home - follow latest Many Labour MPs initially indicated they would back the proposals in principle, but support has ebbed away over recent months over warnings about the impact the cuts could have on the most vulnerable. Around 119 Labour MPs have signed a reasoned amendment to oppose the government's proposals - which, if passed, would effectively kill the legislation. Now, Sir Sadiq, the mayor of London, has become the most senior Labour figure to call for a \"rethink\" of the proposals, which he warned would \"destroy [the] financial safety net\" for \"too many disabled Londoners\". But speaking earlier to Sky News' political editor Beth Rigby from the NATO summit at The Hague, the prime minister said the welfare system needed reform and was \"not working for anyone\". He said the vote planned for Tuesday was not a confidence vote in his leadership but on the need to reform the system.  \"I think most colleagues do accept the case for reform,\" he said. \"We've got to get on and make that reform because the options are: leave the system as it is, trusting people and not helping them, that's not a Labour option. The Labour option is to reform it and make it fit for the future. So we're going to press ahead with these reforms.\" Benefit cuts will 'destroy financial safety nets' Following the comments from the prime minister, Sir Sadiq said he believed that \"more must be done to support people\" back into work and off benefits, as this was \"vital for a healthy and prosperous London\". But he also warned: \"What we can't do is take away the vital safety net that so many vulnerable and disabled Londoners rely upon. \"Having looked at the analysis of the government's plans, the impact on London will be substantial, and for too many disabled Londoners it will destroy their financial safety net.\" Sir Sadiq called on the government to \"urgently think again\" and said it must \"look again at the potential hardship these changes will force on thousands of vulnerable and disabled Londoners\". He also urged ministers to bring in additional employment and training support \"as soon as possible\" and \"before anyone starts to lose their benefits\". Welfare system 'unsustainable' Sir Keir spoke to reporters on the way to the summit about the reforms, saying there were around 1,000 people a day signing up for personal independence payment (PIP) - equivalent to the size of the population of Leicester. \"That is not a system that can be left unreformed, not least because it's unsustainable, and therefore you won't have a welfare system for those that need it in the future,\" he added. \"So those that care about a future welfare system have to answer the question - how do you reform what you've got to make sure it's sustainable for the future?'\" Introduced in March, the government's welfare bill outlines proposals to make it harder for some disabled people to qualify for PIP while also cutting universal credit, another benefit. Political reporter The most controversial elements of the government's welfare bill are changes to PIP and Universal Credit. PIP is money for people who have extra care needs or mobility needs as a result of a disability. People who claim it - some of whom are in work - are awarded points depending on their ability to do certain activities, such as washing and preparing food, and this influences how much they will receive. Under the plans, from November 2026, people will need to score a minimum of four points in at least one activity to qualify for the daily living element of PIP - instead of fewer points across a broader range of tasks the person needs help with. Currently, the standard rate is given if people score between eight and 11 points overall, while the enhanced rate applies from 12 points.\n\nThe changes do not affect the mobility component of PIP. And from April next year, the health element of Universal Credit will be frozen in cash terms for existing claimants at £97 per week until 2029/2030. For new claimants, the health element of Universal Credit will be reduced to £50 per week. \n\nHowever, ministers point to the fact that the Universal Credit standard allowance will increase from £92 per week in 2025-26 to £106 per week by 2029-30. Overall, 3.2 million families are expected to lose an average of £1,720 by the end of 2030 due to the changes.\n\nHowever, the government has stressed that these figures do not take into account the £1bn that is being put towards helping the long-term sick and disabled back into work.\n\n\n It is these changes that have caused the most anxiety among MPs. \n\nAs one Labour MP told Sky News: \"If the thrust of the policy is getting people into work, how does cutting support for people in work, work? \"The thrust of the proposals is right but cutting PIP and Universal Credit isn't about getting people back into work, it's about saving money.\" The reasoned amendment calls on the government to delay the proposals pending an assessment of the impact of the PIP cuts. It also cites concern about the government's own figures which show 250,000 people could be pushed into poverty as a result of the changes and the lack of a formal consultation with disabled people. More from Sky News:Is PM going to have to give in again?UK must 'actively prepare' for war potential One Labour rebel told Sky News there was a \"broad sense of unease across all levels of the parliamentary party\". \"Almost everyone thinks there needs to be reform and there are a lot of good things in the bill, but elements need more thought and explanation if they are going to proceed,\" they said. \"Unless those issues are revised, or much better explained and justified, I don't think there is enough support for the measures. People are really worried there is a rush to do this and that we might sleepwalk into this as we have done with other issues.\" On Tuesday, Downing Street suggested the vote would still go ahead, despite the concerns of some MPs - including influential chairs of parliamentary select committees."

It added: \"Meanwhile, some adversaries are laying the foundations for future conflict, positioning themselves to move quickly to cause major disruption to our energy and or supply chains, to deter us from standing up to their aggression.\"  Responding to the report, Sir Keir Starmer said the UK is \"facing daily challenges on the home front\" The prime minister told Sky News' political editor Beth Rigby that Britain is being targeted by \"very, very frequent and very, very serious\" cyberattacks Energy security is also a concern following Russia's invasion of Ukraine, while the PM also cited the threat of Iran. \"We have to guard properly against those threats, and we will do so,\" Starmer added. 👉Search for The Wargame on your podcast app👈 The government will run annual exercises to test the preparedness of the whole of society as part of efforts to rebuild resilience, the new strategy says. There will also be moves to improve security around critical national infrastructure such as power stations and water supplies as part of what is being called \"Home Defence\". However, the review concedes that \"we cannot stop every hostile actor\". Instead it says the UK will try to \"make the UK a harder target for adversaries and criminals\". Inside The Wargame An armed attack on the UK is exactly the scenario that a new podcast series by Sky News and Tortoise explore. The Wargame simulates Russian missiles strikes against targets across the country to test UK defences. The podcast also draws on the UK's Cold War past.  During the time of the Soviet Union, Britain, like much of the rest of NATO, maintained a much larger professional army, navy and air force, with greater stockpiles of munitions, a bigger reserve force and a far more comprehensive air defence system. This was all kept at a state of readiness that meant the UK could immediately respond to war breaking out. At the same time, wider society was better prepared for conflict - including nuclear war. They also understood the need to allocate more taxpayer cash into funding defence as the ultimate insurance policy. When the Cold War ended though, successive governments took what was seen as a peace dividend, switching investment away from defence and into other priorities such as health, welfare and economic growth. With Britain now facing renewed threats to the home front but without the resilience it relied on in the past, The Wargame plays out what might happen in a crisis."

        "Content": "\n          Business and economics reporter\n              @taaffems\n Google could be forced to change its search engine in the UK to give consumers more choice and control over how they interact with its search services, the competition regulator has warned. The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) has laid out potential remedies Google may have to make, including allowing people to easily switch search engines through a legal requirement for so-called \"choice screens\". Also being considered is ensuring people can transfer their browser history to another provider, and a requirement for transparency over search result ordering and inclusion in AI-generated summaries. Money blog: Warning issued over Glastonbury tickets The CMA has also proposed designating the tech giant with \"strategic market status\", which would give the regulator greater control over how Google operates search services. Why is this happening? It's all being done to give consumers \"more choice and control\" and to unlock \"greater opportunities for innovation across the UK tech sector and broader economy\", the CMA's chief executive, Sarah Cardell, said. The average person in the UK makes five to 10 searches a day, the CMA said, with Google's services \"critical\" for more than 200,000 UK businesses, which rely on the company to reach customers. \"Our investigation so far suggests there are ways to make these markets more open, competitive and innovative,\" Ms Cardell said.  Possible measures and concerns outlined by the watchdog do not mean Google is guilty of anti-competitive practices. Nor does the \"strategic market status\" designation, given due to its dominant position in search and advertising. Were the CMA to go through with the measures, \"the outcome could have significant implications for businesses and consumers in the UK\", Google's senior director for competition, Oliver Bethell, said. \"This announcement presents clear challenges to critical areas of our business in the UK.\" \"We're concerned that the scope of the CMA's considerations remains broad and unfocused, with a range of interventions being considered before any evidence has been provided,\" the firm added. The announcement on Tuesday morning is a continuation of the investigation first announced in January. What next? A final decision on whether to apply the remedies and designate Google as having \"strategic market status\" will be made in October. But in the second half of 2026, the CMA said it planned to consider actions to address \"more complex\" concerns. These include the impact of Google's bargaining position on internet publishers, its treatment of rival specialised search firms, and transparency and control in search advertising.

        "Content": "\n          Culture and entertainment reporter\n              @gemmapeplow\n Prosecutors and defence lawyers have rested their cases in the sex-trafficking trial of Sean \"Diddy\" Combs, bringing more than six weeks of testimony against the hip-hop mogul to a close. The high-profile trial has heard from more than 30 witnesses, including the rapper's ex-girlfriend Cassie Ventura, as well as former employees of his company Bad Boy Entertainment, male escorts, law enforcement officers and hotel staff. But one person jurors won't hear from is Combs himself. Confirming this to Judge Arun Subramanian, the rapper said he had discussed the issue of testifying \"thoroughly\" with his team and made the decision not to give evidence. He also thanked the judge and told him he was doing an \"excellent job\". Diddy trial: As it happened After the prosecution rested, the defence team moved for the judge to acquit the 55-year-old - a fairly standard move - saying attorneys for the government had not provided evidence to prove any of the charges filed. They then presented a brief case themselves, submitting more text messages as evidence to show Combs and his girlfriends were in loving, consensual relationships, and making a few stipulations about testimony, but calling no witnesses. This lasted for less than an hour. They have previously conceded Combs has been violent in the past, something he is \"not proud\" of, but said this did not make him a sex trafficker. Sean 'Diddy' Combs is charged with one count of racketeering conspiracy, two charges of sex-trafficking, and two charges of transportation to engage in prostitution. He has pleaded not guilty to all charges and has strenuously denied all allegations of sexual abuse. The hip-hop mogul's defence team has described him as \"a complicated man\" but say the case is not. They have conceded Combs could be violent and that jurors might not condone his proclivity for \"kinky sex\". However, they argue this was a consensual \"swingers\" lifestyle and was not illegal. Combs has remained in jail without bail since he was arrested in New York in September last year. Throughout the trial, defence lawyers have made their case for exoneration through their questioning of witnesses called by the prosecution, including several who gave evidence reluctantly or after they were granted immunity to testify. Prosecutors argue Combs coerced and forced Cassie and another former girlfriend, who testified under the pseudonym Jane, into \"freak off\" sex sessions with male escorts, and used his business empire to facilitate these, as well as drug use, and cover up bad behaviour. During the first week of the trial, Cassie, 38, spent four days giving evidence. Heavily pregnant at the time, she told jurors she felt pressured to take part in hundreds of \"freak offs\" with male sex workers as Combs watched. She told the court they became so frequent during their relationship, which began in 2007 and ended in 2018, that they were \"like a job\", and she had barely any time for her own career. The singer and musician gave birth two weeks after her testimony, her friend and former stylist confirmed as he gave evidence himself in court. Jane testified for six days about similar sexual performances, which Combs referred to as \"hotel nights\", \"wild king nights\" or \"debauchery\" with her, the court heard. Like Cassie, she said she felt coerced into engaging in them because she loved the music star and wanted to please him. Jane dated Combs on and off from early 2021 to his arrest in 2024. Jurors have been shown several recordings of these sex sessions, lasting more than 40 minutes in total. The footage was shown on monitors and jurors used headphones, keeping it private from the media and members of the public in court. In her opening statement, defence lawyer Teny Geragos called the videos \"powerful evidence that the sexual conduct in this case was consensual and not based on coercion\". Read more:Everything you need to know about the trialThe rise and fall of Sean 'Diddy' CombsWhat we learned from Cassie's testimony The trial also heard from Mia, another alleged victim who testified under a pseudonym. Mia was a former employee of Combs, who told the court he sexually assaulted her on several occasions in the years she worked for him. She had never told anyone about the alleged abuse until the investigation into Combs, she said, telling the court she was ashamed. \"I was going to die with this,\" she said, becoming tearful on the stand. \"I didn't want anyone to know ever.\" The trial has been eventful, with one juror dismissed and replaced by an alternate after it emerged he had given conflicting evidence about where he lives. The judge said he had \"serious concerns\" that not being truthful about this could potentially mean he wanted to be on the jury for a particular reason. And at one point, Combs was warned by the judge for nodding enthusiastically toward jurors during a section of cross-examination by his lawyers. The judge said he could be excluded from the trial if it happened again. Court is not in session on Wednesday. The trial continues on Thursday, when closing statements from the legal teams will begin."

In a tale straight out of Winnie The Pooh, Mish and Lucy immediately dashed for the food store during their hour of freedom at the Wildwood Trust site.

A fundraising campaign meant the siblings could be transported to Wildwood's Kent park in 2020 - and after six months, they settled into their \"forever home\" in Devon. Mish is a playful bear who enjoys splashing around in pools and swinging in hammocks, while Lucy \"loves nothing more\" than spending time with her brother and climbing trees. They feast on kilos of berries, fruits, vegetables, seeds, fish and meat every day. And honey… apparently."
