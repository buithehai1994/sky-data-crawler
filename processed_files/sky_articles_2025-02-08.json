        "Content": "The parents of two of the girls murdered at a dance class in Southport have spoken of the moment they were told \"something awful has happened\" to their children. In an interview with The Sunday Times, the parents of Bebe King and Elsie Dot Stancombe paid tribute to their daughters, while recalling what happened on 29 July 2024. Warning: Some readers may find this article distressing Describing the moment she dropped her daughter off at the two-hour workshop at Hart Space studio, Jenni Stancombe said she watched Elsie run inside, excited to show her friend her newly pierced ears. \"I watched her sit down and waved her off and I left her,\" she said. Just before midday, Ms Stancombe got a call from another mother, telling her: \"Something awful has happened. Somebody's stabbed the kids. \"I said, 'What do you mean?'\" Ms Stancombe said. \"She went, 'It's really bad. You need to get here'. \"I just ran. I left the whole house open and got in the car.\" Bebe King's parents - who cannot be named for legal reasons - had been busily preparing for a wedding the following day. Her mother remembers being in Marks & Spencer when she received a phone call from her husband, who had arrived early to collect Bebe. \"I was about to put my card in the machine, and he called. 'I can't believe I'm telling you this but somebody has gone into the dance class with a knife',\" she said. She ran outside and jumped into a taxi. The driver dropped her off at the end of the street - \"and I just ran\". Parents' tributes to children Bebe's parents came up with her name after a trip to Hollywood, where they saw the blues guitarist BB King's star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. Bebe King's mother said of her daughter: \"She would come out with the most random stuff. She would do it and look at you and laugh as if to say, 'I'm dead funny, aren't I?' She would give you this hug and say, 'I love you, momma'. \"She was the best. She was just … Me and her had our own little language. Sometimes we would just look at each other and know what each other was thinking.\" She said Bebe \"had this innate kindness. She had a spark\". Ms Stancombe said it was an honour to be Elsie's mother. \"Everything she did was pure enthusiasm. It could be the most boring thing - even, like, David taking the bins out - and it was like, 'I'll come!' She was grateful for life.\" She described her daughter as \"highly intelligent\" but said she struggled with reading and writing. Leanne Lucas, who ran the dance workshop, had been Elsie's private tutor for 18 months. She had originally missed out on a spot at the dance workshop, which had quickly sold out. One of her school friends was going to the class and her mother messaged Ms Stancombe saying, \"Have you got her a space?\" \"And I was like, \"Oh no'. I knew it had sold out, so I messaged Leanne saying, 'Aw, I totally forgot to pay for Elsie'. And she messaged saying: 'No problem. I'll always have a place for Elsie.' And she kept one. I just always think if she'd given it away…\" Rioting in Southport The families were told to come off their social media accounts after riots broke out in Southport, and Elsie's father and uncle Chris visited the wreckage of the riots the following day. Neither wanted to comment on the rioting that followed their children's deaths. Instead, both families paid tribute to the community that rallied around them in the wake of the tragedy. \"It's about this community. It has brought light in the darkness, these little moments. And that's what we're constantly looking for right now.\" Bebe's family spent the following week with her in a bereavement suite at Alder Hey Hospital in Liverpool. On the last day, her mother and father did a final bedtime routine, reading her Jack and the Beanstalk before they left. No funeral director would accept money, while donations and support flooded in for the families. Bebe had a white horse and carriage. \"It's not very us,\" her parents told the Sunday Times while laughing, \"but it was for her and we knew she would want that.\" Royal Family brought 'genuine comfort' The efforts of the Royal Family brought \"genuine comfort\" to both families, they told the Sunday Times. Mr Stancombe said the visit by the Princess of Wales - her first public engagement since finishing chemotherapy - \"meant a great deal to Jenni\". \"I won't say what they said to us, but what they shared with us was really, really powerful, and it was a powerful message and heartfelt, and it meant a lot,\" he said. The families also met the King at Clarence House in August. \"We could see how much he cared,\" Mr Stancombe said, laughing about the moment Elsie's sister offered the King a biscuit. 'Highly likely' killer will never be released Axel Rudakubana was jailed in January for a minimum term of 52 years after he pleaded guilty to murdering Alice da Silva Aguiar, nine, Bebe, six, and Elsie, seven, at a Taylor Swift-themed dance class. Rudakubana also admitted trying to murder eight other children, as well as instructor Leanne Lucas and businessman John Hayes, on 29 July last year. He was 17 years old when he walked into the dance studio, indiscriminately stabbing his victims with a 20cm blade he had bought on Amazon. He was given 13 life sentences, with Mr Justice Goose saying the killings had caused \"shock and revulsion\" around the nation and said it was \"highly likely\" he would never be released. Read more:The 14 minutes of terror that left three children deadFamily of Rudakubana 'moved to secret location' During sentencing he was twice ordered out of the dock after trying to disrupt proceedings, by shouting that he \"felt ill\". The court heard emotional statements from victims and families, with Ms Lucas who was stabbed in the back, saying she couldn't give herself \"compassion or accept praise, as how can I live knowing I survived when children died?\". The incident was not labelled a terror attack, although officers later found a plastic box containing the toxin ricin under his bed in the village of Banks, Lancashire, along with other weapons including a machete and arrows. His devices revealed an obsession with violence, war and genocide, and he was found to be in possession of an al Qaeda training manual. It fell outside the definition of terrorism because police couldn't identify the killer's motive. Families did not want sentencing televised Neither family was in court when Rudakubana suddenly changed his plea to guilty. Both families did not want the sentencing televised, while Bebe's family believe details about her injuries went beyond what was necessary. \"The sentencing shouldn't have been televised,\" Elsie's uncle Chris says. Bebe's father agreed: \"We know it has to be heard in court but why did the whole nation need to see it on television?\" Both talked about their struggle to adapt to a new life without their daughters. Mr Stancombe worked as a postman - he described how he would drop the post off at Elsie's school and she would run over at lunchtime with her friends to say hello. None of the parents have gone back to work yet, but Mr and Ms Stancombe have set up a charity - Elsie's Story, to help other children in need."

Mr Gwynne reportedly made antisemitic comments and 'joked' about a pensioner constituent, saying he hoped she died before the next election, according to the Mail on Sunday. In the WhatsApp chat, which contained Labour councillors, party officials and at least one other MP, Mr Gwynne made racist comments about Labour MP Dianne Abbott and sexist remarks about Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner. A government spokesperson said: \"The prime minister is determined to uphold high standards of conduct in public office and lead a government in the service of working people. He will not hesitate to take action against any minister who fails to meet these standards, as he has in this case.\" Read more:Warning to Labour MPs who set up group over Reform threatWhen it's green or growth there's only one winner for PM A Labour spokesperson confirmed Mr Gwynne had been suspended as a member of the Labour Party. \"We are investigating comments made in this WhatsApp group in line with the Labour Party's rules and procedures,\" they said. \"Swift action will be taken if individuals are found to have breached the high standards expected of them as Labour Party members.\" \n                  Love or hate her, the much-disputed spirit of Margaret Thatcher continues to march through UK politics\n                 \n                  Grenfell Tower will be demolished, government confirms\n                 \n                  Politics latest: Number 10 defends handling of 'deeply emotive' Grenfell Tower decision\n                 Mr Gwynne said he deeply regretted his \"badly misjudged comments\" and apologised for any offence caused. \"I've served the Labour Party all my life and it was a huge honour to be appointed a minister by Keir Starmer. \"I entirely understand the decisions the PM and the party have taken and, while very sad to have been suspended, will support them in any way I can.\" Nigel Huddleston MP, co-chairman of the Conservative Party, said there is \"clear contempt for pensioners in the Labour Party\". \"This clearly goes beyond Andrew Gwynne and there is a rot in Labour that needs fixing.

        "Content": "The Duke and Duchess of Sussex cheered and clapped as the United Kingdom's team walked onto the stage for the opening ceremony of the Invictus Games. Harry and Meghan arrived in Vancouver on Saturday for the seventh edition of the games that were established by Prince Harry in 2014. Coldplay's Chris Martin, Nelly Furtado and Katy Perry are all due to perform at the opening event. The president of Boeing International (which is presenting the games), Brendan Nelson, told the ceremony audience: \"Prince Harry has given duty, courage, hope and love a name. Invictus.\" As Mr Nelson told Prince Harry, \"we are proud of you\", the Duchess of Sussex clapped and smiled at her husband, touching his face affectionately. On her Instagram story earlier on Saturday, she shared a video as she posed alongside her husband for a picture with Team USA. She also posted a video where she hugged a woman in a Team Canada kit. Meghan's attendance is understood to underscore her support for her husband and the mission of Invictus, which brings together more than 500 competitors from 23 nations. It is the first time the games will include winter sports. British veterans and serving personnel who were injured during service departed for Canada earlier this week to take part in the games. The 62 competitors are all veterans and serving personnel who sustained life-changing injuries or illnesses during their time in the UK Armed Forces. The games were last held in Dusseldorf in 2023. Invictus 2027 will be held in Birmingham, returning to the UK for the first time since its inception, when the first games were held in London. The games were inspired after Prince Harry took a trip to the Warrior Games in 2013, where he saw how sport could aid injured service personnel in their recoveries. At the time, Harry worked in partnership with his then charity The Royal Foundation of The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and Prince Harry, to deliver the games alongside the Ministry of Defence. The first games, held in London's Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park, brought together 400 competitors from 13 nations around the world The name of the games, Invictus, means 'unconquered'. For Meghan and Harry, it has been the backdrop to some key moments in their lives. The couple famously appeared in public together for the first time at the Toronto Invictus Games in 2017, pictured hand in hand at a wheelchair tennis event. They attended the 2018 Invictus Games just five days after announcing they were expecting their first child. Then, just days after their son Archie was born, Prince Harry travelled to the Netherlands to promote the 2020 Invictus Games, which had been due to take place at the Hague. These games were later delayed to 2022 due to the COVID pandemic, but during this initial visit he was gifted an Invictus-themed onesie by Princess Margriet. Meghan has a number of upcoming projects, including a Netflix series With Love, Meghan, which will now be released on 4 March, after being delayed due to the wildfires in LA."

Dawn and Andrew Searle, who have not been officially identified but have been named by French news sites, were found at their home in the hamlet of Les Pesquies, south of Villefranche-de-Rouergue, on Thursday. Investigations into how they died are still ongoing. Country musician and former Hollyoaks star Callum Kerr shared a statement about his mum on Instagram on Saturday. \"At this time, Callum Kerr and Amanda Kerr are grieving the loss of their mother, Dawn Searle (nee Smith, Kerr), while Tom Searle and Ella Searle are mourning the loss of their father, Andrew Searle,\" the statement said. It went on to ask for privacy \"during this difficult period\" and said further updates would be provided \"as appropriate\". Several local media outlets have reported Ms Searle's body was found outside their home, while Mr Searle's body was discovered inside. Ms Searle was seen by a neighbour, according to La Depeche and Midi Libre. La Depeche also reports she was naked, with jewellery found scattered nearby. A source \"close to the investigation\" told Midi Libre she had suffered a major head wound. The neighbour who found her initially thought she was unwell, it said, before calling emergency services. Mr Searle was found hanged inside the house and had been gagged, both publications reported. Investigators are reportedly looking at whether the British couple were killed during a burglary, but all lines of inquiry are said to remain open following the discovery of their bodies on Thursday.

The court heard emotional statements from victims and families, with Ms Lucas who was stabbed in the back, saying she couldn't give herself \"compassion or accept praise, as how can I live knowing I survived when children died?\". The incident was not labelled a terror attack, although officers later found a plastic box containing the toxin ricin under his bed in the village of Banks, Lancashire, along with other weapons including a machete and arrows. His devices revealed an obsession with violence, war and genocide, and he was found to be in possession of an al Qaeda training manual. It fell outside the definition of terrorism because police couldn't identify the killer's motive. Families did not want sentencing televised Neither family was in court when Rudakubana suddenly changed his plea to guilty. Both families did not want the sentencing televised, while Bebe's family believe details about her injuries went beyond what was necessary. \"The sentencing shouldn't have been televised,\" Elsie's uncle Chris says. Bebe's father agreed: \"We know it has to be heard in court but why did the whole nation need to see it on television?\" Both talked about their struggle to adapt to a new life without their daughters. Mr Stancombe worked as a postman - he described how he would drop the post off at Elsie's school and she would run over at lunchtime with her friends to say hello. None of the parents have gone back to work yet, but Mr and Ms Stancombe have set up a charity - Elsie's Story, to help other children in need."

        "Content": " Hundreds of people have attended a march in memory of a 15-year-old boy stabbed to death at his school - ahead of a tribute by his football club, Sheffield United. Harvey Willgoose died on Monday after he was attacked at All Saints Catholic School in the city. Dozens of people have left flowers and messages outside the school since his death. Harvey was an avid Sheffield United fan and football shirts, scarves and messages have been left for him outside the stadium in the city. One message written on a Sheffield United shirt reads: \"RIP Harvey. Forever in our hearts.\" Harvey's friends joined Sheffield United supporters and others affected by his death at Sheffield Town Hall to march to the ground ahead of the match against Portsmouth at 3pm on Saturday. One black and white banner with a picture of Harvey inside the Sheffield United logo read: \"Lives not knives. It's not OK.\" The march was supported by Sheffield anti-knife crime charity Always An Alternative. At the game, play was stopped and applause broke out in the 15th minute, as fans and players paid tribute. Fans also stopped for a similar tribute at West Bromwich Albion's ground The Hawthorns for their game against Sheffield Wednesday. Earlier on Saturday churches in the city held services to commemorate the teenager. Mark McManus, the parish priest at St Joseph's church in Handsworth, Sheffield, said: \"Harvey was a former pupil of St Joseph's Academy and, along with the members of our community who attend All Saints High School, many will have been affected by his death - some very closely.\" Read more from Sky News:Judge pauses Trump plan to put employees on forced leaveReleased Israeli hostage appeared 'gaunt', family member saysBaltic states cut power ties with Russia In a statement released by police, Harvey's family said their lives would \"never be the same again\" and they were \"utterly heartbroken\". Paying tribute, Harvey's sister Sophie Willgoose said: \"My heart is broken into a million pieces.\" A 15-year-old boy charged with murdering Harvey has been remanded into youth detention accommodation. The defendant, who cannot be named because of his age, appeared at Sheffield Crown Court on Thursday charged with murder, possession of a bladed article and affray. A trial date has been fixed for 30 June. by Charlotte Leeming, north of England correspondent\nFor Harvey Willgoose's family his death at just 15 years old is a deeply personal tragedy but in the days since he died there's been a very public show of support.  His family attended a special mass this morning at a Catholic Church not far from where he went to primary school. It was a service to commemorate his life and people of all ages packed into the building to remember him.  Then just hours after that poignant and personal church service, Harvey's parents and sister attended a very public memorial march through Sheffield. Hundreds gathered together, to make a stand against knife crime. Holding a huge banner with Harvey's face in it and the words \"lives not knives\". Many in the crowd held balloons in the red and white colours of Harvey's beloved Sheffield United. They marched to the Bramall Lane ground where Harvey spent many of his weekends, his parents and sister leading the way.  Accompanied by loud chants of \"there's only one Harvey Willgoose\", his mum, Caroline, said the turnout was \"amazing\" and the support shown by the community was \"helping me get through it\" Many of Harvey's friends were also there, some were overwhelmed by the occasion, crying openly and hugging one another for support. His friend Ruby told me Harvey was a loving and caring boy who did a lot for the community. Harvey's death is being felt right across this city. One dad who was with his nine-year-old son, said the whole of Sheffield has felt numb and sad since Harvey died. He added that he hugged his son a lot tighter on Monday night. And then at Bramall Lane a minute's applause was held in the 15th minute of United's game against Portsmouth. All rivalries set aside, as the stadium paid tribute to a football-mad teenager in one of his favourite places. "

The 28-year-old from Belfast was taken to intensive care after he lost to Welsh boxer Nathan Howells at the Ulster Hall last Saturday. It was his first defence of the Celtic super-featherweight title. The fight was stopped in the ninth round, and it later emerged Cooney had an intracranial haemorrhage. In a statement on social media, his promoters MHD Promotions said: \"It is with complete devastation that we have to announce that after a week of battling for his life, John Cooney has sadly passed away. \"Mr & Mrs Cooney and his fiancée Emmaleen would like to thank the staff at Belfast's Royal Victoria Hospital who have worked tirelessly to save John's life and for everyone who has sent messages of support and prayers. \"He was a much-loved son, brother and partner and it will take us all a lifetime to forget how special he was.

        "Content": "\n          Sky News correspondent\n        Two years ago, Dayni suffered the sudden and unexpected loss of her mother, Janice. The shock of her passing was traumatic enough - but what followed made the grieving process even more unbearable. Warning: this story contains details some readers may find upsetting Dayni was in hospital when her mother died, so it was a few days before she could view the body. \"I just couldn't believe what I saw,\" Dayni recalled. \"She just didn't look like my mum at all. She was all pushed up, with marks all over her face. And she was bloated - really bloated.\" Janice's body had been left in the care of a funeral director, and embalmed. But something went terribly wrong. \"She was covered in blood, severely bloated to the point of bursting,\" Dayni said. \"She looked battered and bruised, like she'd been attacked. But she died in her sleep. She just looked awful.\" \n                  Parents of Southport stabbings victims pay tribute to daughters - and describe moment they were told 'something awful has happened'\n                 \n                  Andrew Gwynne sacked as health minister over comments posted on a WhatsApp group\n                 \n                  Harvey Willgoose: Sheffield United fans and players pay poignant tribute to teenager stabbed to death\n                 Desperate for help, Dayni asked another funeral director to step in and take over the care of her mother's body. But in hindsight, as Dayni has spent two years fighting for some kind of redress, this has only served to complicate the chain of responsibility. As Janice's body continued to deteriorate, it became increasingly difficult to determine who was responsible for the errors in caring for her. Sky News has seen images of the condition of Janice's body, which we are not publishing. But the distress of seeing her mother in such a state had a profound effect on Dayni. \"I was devastated. I couldn't sleep. I was thinking all sorts - had they just tossed her about like she was nothing? It's horrible. It's ruined my life.\" A broken system The funeral sector in the UK remains entirely unregulated. While trade bodies exist to uphold standards, they have little power to enforce them. And the penalties they can impose are minimal. The most severe sanction available is expulsion - but this does not prevent an expelled company from continuing to practice. In Dayni's case, one funeral director was investigated by their trade body, the National Society of Allied and Independent Funeral Directors (SAIF), and found to have breached standards. They were \"reprimanded\" - in essence, given a telling-off - but even still, they refused to acknowledge the findings or accept responsibility. Instead, they commissioned a report from an independent embalmer, seen by Sky News, which points the finger of blame at the second funeral director. The second funeral director could not be investigated at all by SAIF, because they are not a member, though they strenuously deny any wrongdoing. No one has any overarching responsibility The embalmer, who was self-employed, was also given a \"severe reprimand\" by her trade body, the British Institute of Embalmers, as well as a \"strong recommendation\" to seek further training. She could not be reached for comment. Absent of any regulation, nobody has any overarching responsibility. Nobody is able to give Dayni a full picture of what happened to her mother, or conduct a thorough investigation, with appropriate penalties. When approached for comment, both funeral directors denied any wrongdoing. We asked both trade bodies whether they were, in essence, marking their own homework, and whether they felt the sector should be regulated. The British Institute of Embalmers said: \"We would certainly welcome structured regulation within the industry. The industry does really mark its own homework.\" A spokesperson for SAIF stated: \"We don't believe the industry is marking its own homework. SAIF's standards framework is monitored by the UK Accreditation Service. We have long supported the call for regulation of the funeral sector.\" Calls for urgent reform Recent high-profile cases have shone a light on the urgent need for change. In 2022, the Fuller Inquiry was launched to investigate how David Fuller was able to commit sexual offences across mortuaries in Kent. In an interim report issued at the end of last year its chair, Sir Jonathan Michael, called for urgent regulation of the funeral sector. Last year, Legacy Funeral Directors in Hull came under police investigation following reports of bodies not being properly cared for. In January, a file was passed to the Crown Prosecution Service to consider bringing criminal charges. Lindesay Mace, of the charity Quaker Social Action, said: \"Most funeral directors provide good care, but the lack of regulation means there are no mandatory training requirements, no particular standards for facilities, and no oversight of premises.\" Read more from Sky News:Nurse struck off after 'financially grooming' patientFootball Manager 25 cancelledBoy, 11, charged after double stabbing Perhaps most alarming is the absence of basic requirements such as refrigeration. \"There isn't even a requirement to have cold storage facilities,\" Lindesay explained. \"Most people will find that completely unbelievable.\" Government response The Ministry of Justice has acknowledged the concerns raised by grieving families and industry professionals alike. In a statement, it confirmed it was \"reviewing the full range of possible next steps... including looking at options for regulation\". However, no concrete timeline has been provided. In Scotland, the devolved government has already begun the process of regulation. No answers, no accountability For Dayni, the lack of regulation has left her without answers, or redress. \"When I looked into all of this and found out there were no regulations I couldn't believe it. It's just mind blowing. I just think it's disgusting, and something needs to change.\""

        "Content": "The Duke and Duchess of Sussex cheered and clapped as the United Kingdom's team walked onto the stage for the opening ceremony of the Invictus Games. Harry and Meghan arrived in Vancouver on Saturday for the seventh edition of the games that were established by Prince Harry in 2014. Coldplay's Chris Martin, Nelly Furtado and Katy Perry are all due to perform at the opening event. The president of Boeing International (which is presenting the games), Brendan Nelson, told the ceremony audience: \"Prince Harry has given duty, courage, hope and love a name. Invictus.\" As Mr Nelson told Prince Harry, \"we are proud of you\", the Duchess of Sussex clapped and smiled at her husband, touching his face affectionately. On her Instagram story earlier on Saturday, she shared a video as she posed alongside her husband for a picture with Team USA. She also posted a video where she hugged a woman in a Team Canada kit. Meghan's attendance is understood to underscore her support for her husband and the mission of Invictus, which brings together more than 500 competitors from 23 nations. It is the first time the games will include winter sports. British veterans and serving personnel who were injured during service departed for Canada earlier this week to take part in the games. The 62 competitors are all veterans and serving personnel who sustained life-changing injuries or illnesses during their time in the UK Armed Forces. The games were last held in Dusseldorf in 2023. Invictus 2027 will be held in Birmingham, returning to the UK for the first time since its inception, when the first games were held in London. The games were inspired after Prince Harry took a trip to the Warrior Games in 2013, where he saw how sport could aid injured service personnel in their recoveries. At the time, Harry worked in partnership with his then charity The Royal Foundation of The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and Prince Harry, to deliver the games alongside the Ministry of Defence. The first games, held in London's Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park, brought together 400 competitors from 13 nations around the world The name of the games, Invictus, means 'unconquered'. For Meghan and Harry, it has been the backdrop to some key moments in their lives. The couple famously appeared in public together for the first time at the Toronto Invictus Games in 2017, pictured hand in hand at a wheelchair tennis event. They attended the 2018 Invictus Games just five days after announcing they were expecting their first child. Then, just days after their son Archie was born, Prince Harry travelled to the Netherlands to promote the 2020 Invictus Games, which had been due to take place at the Hague. These games were later delayed to 2022 due to the COVID pandemic, but during this initial visit he was gifted an Invictus-themed onesie by Princess Margriet. Meghan has a number of upcoming projects, including a Netflix series With Love, Meghan, which will now be released on 4 March, after being delayed due to the wildfires in LA."

After Liam and Noel Gallagher announced a limited run of stadium shows last summer, thousands of fans logged on to Ticketmaster in hopes of seeing the band play live for the first time since 2009. However, the event company is currently under investigation over their use of dynamic pricing - which saw prices for a standard ticket double from £148 to £355. Several fans have now said that they received emails from Ticketmaster which claimed the use of bots was identified in their ticket purchases and cancelled them as a result. Leighah Conroy, 24, had bought four tickets to see Oasis perform at Heaton Park in Manchester on 28 August last year - but was told on Friday that Ticketmaster \"identified that bots were used to make this purchase\". She told the PA news agency: \"To say that we're bots is totally out of order for Ticketmaster because we tried all day to get the tickets. \"Our heads have been pretty battered these past 24 hours. I felt sick in the stomach. It's a band you'll never experience or see again and it's been on my bucket list for years. \"It just feels like my dreams have been completely crushed.\" Ms Conroy, from Cumbria, paid around £150 per ticket, and also spent £800 on a hotel and a further £40 for travel to the show. Marta Bonnet, 48, from Spain, also said she received the same email on Friday. She said she spent more than £3,000 on tickets, flights and accommodation for herself, her husband and her children to see Oasis at Wembley Stadium on 3 August. \"At first we thought this email was fake or a spam email, but no it was true,\" she added. \"We usually use Ticketmaster to buy our tickets... But now, how can I trust this page which is supposed to be the official page? \"I really can't believe what has happened.\" A spokesperson for Ticketmaster said: \"Anyone who has been contacted and believes a refund was made in error has been sent a form to fill in for the tour's promoters to review.\" Read more:Oasis announce more dates on world tourHappy Mondays stars give thoughts on dynamic pricing The Competition and Markets Authority said in September that it had launched an investigation into Ticketmaster's Oasis gigs sale - calling for evidence from fans.

Oasis will begin their reunion tour on 4 July in Cardiff before playing another 16 dates in the UK and Ireland. The tour then moves to Canada, the US, Mexico, and Australia."

Eli Sharabi, Ohad Ben Ami and Or Levy were the latest hostages freed this morning in front of a crowd of heavily armed fighters. Both Mr Ami, 56, and Mr Sharabi, 52, were taken from Kibbutz Be'eri during the 7 October attack. Mr Levy, 34, was abducted from the Nova music festival. It was not known if Mr Sharabi was aware his wife and children had been killed by Hamas over a year ago. His Bristol-born wife Lianne Sharabi, along with their children 16-year-old Noiya and 13-year-old Yahel, were killed while Mr Sharabi and his brother Yossi were taken hostage. Yossi was later killed while in captivity. Mr Sharabi was paraded on a podium by armed Hamas personnel and interviewed before his release earlier today. In one of his answers, which was clearly given under duress, he said he was hoping to see his wife and daughters very soon, according to translations provided by our US partner NBC News. Mr Sharabi also told the crowd he was aware of his brother's death and said he was \"very angry\" with the Israeli government. All three hostages made similar critical comments about Israel while on stage with the armed men. The comments came as Stephen Brisley, Mr Sharabi's brother-in-law, told Sky News presenter Anna Jones this morning that he wasn't sure if he had found out about his family's fate. \"All the way through this, we've wondered whether what's kept him going is the prospect of being reunited with Lianne and the girls,\" he said. He described his brother-in-law as looking \"skinny\" and \"gaunt\". \"You could see how skinny he is, how pale he is.

A bus carrying several dozen Palestinian prisoners from Israel's Ofer prison arrived in the occupied West Bank, where their families and friends were waiting. Sky News Middle East correspondent Alistair Bunkall said some of the prisoners also looked to be in a \"very bad condition\". And in a statement later on Saturday, Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer said he was \"dismayed to see his (Mr Sharabi's) frail condition and the circumstances of his release\". He added: \"Having met his relatives I appreciate the deep pain they have endured and my thoughts are with them. \"We must continue to see all the hostages freed - these people were ripped away from their lives in the most brutal circumstances and held in appalling conditions. The ceasefire must hold and all efforts need to focus on full implementation of the remaining phases. This includes the return of further hostages, the continued increase of aid into Gaza and securing lasting peace in the Middle East.\" Some 18 Israeli hostages and more than 550 Palestinian prisoners have been freed since the ceasefire began on 19 January. Under the deal, 33 Israeli hostages are to be released in an initial stage in exchange for almost 2,000 Palestinian prisoners and detainees. Negotiations on a second phase of the deal began this week. It is aimed at returning the remaining hostages and agreeing to a full withdrawal of Israeli troops from Gaza in preparation to end the war. It is feared US President Donald Trump's proposal to move the Palestinian population out of Gaza so the US could take over could complicate the second and more difficult phase of the ceasefire. Hamas's cross-border attack into Israel saw around 1,200 Israelis killed and around 250 people taken hostage. Since then Israel's war in Gaza has killed more than 47,000, according to the Hamas-run health ministry, which does not differentiate between civilians and combatants."

Reports in Israel say they have lost up to 30% of their body weight and they are in a bad medical condition. Ohad Ben Ami, Eli Sharabi and Or Levy looked much frailer than any of the hostages released previously during this phase of the ceasefire. Their time in captivity has obviously been punishing. Gaza ceasefire latest Like previous hostage releases, they were humiliatingly paraded on stage but this time interviewed in front of the crowd, in a propaganda stunt for Hamas. Eli Sharabi said he was looking forward to seeing his wife Lianne and two daughters again - he didn't know that all three of them had been killed on 7 October. His brother Yossi was also taken hostage but died last year in Gaza. Israeli media is reporting that Or Levi was unaware his wife had been killed at the Nova music festival. It has all caused a real feeling of shock and anger in Israel tonight and a new urgency to get all of the hostages home as quickly as possible. Benjamin Netanyahu has reacted angrily, promising a response. The Israeli president has described it as a crime against humanity and the IDF point man for the hostages has accused Hamas of violating the ceasefire agreement. Any action by the Israeli government could threaten the ceasefire and therefore the release of more hostages. As the hostage families forum and Israel's president have said, the most important thing is freeing all the captives and getting them home. Many of the Palestinian prisoners are also returning home looking painfully thin and with stories of being beaten in detention. One prisoner had to be carried off the Red Cross bus by a medic from the Palestinian Red Crescent earlier today. The Palestinian prisoners released today say they were forced to watch a video of the destruction of Gaza before they were freed. But there has been a shift in tone and mood after today's events and it's unclear what happens next."

Harry and Meghan arrived in Vancouver on Saturday for the seventh edition of the games that were established by Prince Harry in 2014. Coldplay's Chris Martin, Nelly Furtado and Katy Perry are all due to perform at the opening event. The president of Boeing International (which is presenting the games), Brendan Nelson, told the ceremony audience: \"Prince Harry has given duty, courage, hope and love a name. Invictus.\" As Mr Nelson told Prince Harry, \"we are proud of you\", the Duchess of Sussex clapped and smiled at her husband, touching his face affectionately. On her Instagram story earlier on Saturday, she shared a video as she posed alongside her husband for a picture with Team USA. She also posted a video where she hugged a woman in a Team Canada kit. Meghan's attendance is understood to underscore her support for her husband and the mission of Invictus, which brings together more than 500 competitors from 23 nations. It is the first time the games will include winter sports. British veterans and serving personnel who were injured during service departed for Canada earlier this week to take part in the games. The 62 competitors are all veterans and serving personnel who sustained life-changing injuries or illnesses during their time in the UK Armed Forces. The games were last held in Dusseldorf in 2023. Invictus 2027 will be held in Birmingham, returning to the UK for the first time since its inception, when the first games were held in London. The games were inspired after Prince Harry took a trip to the Warrior Games in 2013, where he saw how sport could aid injured service personnel in their recoveries. At the time, Harry worked in partnership with his then charity The Royal Foundation of The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and Prince Harry, to deliver the games alongside the Ministry of Defence. The first games, held in London's Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park, brought together 400 competitors from 13 nations around the world The name of the games, Invictus, means 'unconquered'. For Meghan and Harry, it has been the backdrop to some key moments in their lives. The couple famously appeared in public together for the first time at the Toronto Invictus Games in 2017, pictured hand in hand at a wheelchair tennis event. They attended the 2018 Invictus Games just five days after announcing they were expecting their first child. Then, just days after their son Archie was born, Prince Harry travelled to the Netherlands to promote the 2020 Invictus Games, which had been due to take place at the Hague. These games were later delayed to 2022 due to the COVID pandemic, but during this initial visit he was gifted an Invictus-themed onesie by Princess Margriet. Meghan has a number of upcoming projects, including a Netflix series With Love, Meghan, which will now be released on 4 March, after being delayed due to the wildfires in LA."

Paul Kagame, president of neighbouring Rwanda, whose government is accused of backing the M23 rebels, is there, along with other leaders from eastern and southern Africa. Leaders from the East African Community bloc, which includes both Rwanda and Congo, and those from the Southern African Development Community, or SADC, are taking part in the talks, which began in the Tanzanian capital, Dar es Salaam, on Friday. Why is there fighting in DRC? Congolese President Felix Tshisekedi is attending virtually. Around 3,000 people have been killed in the fighting between rebels and government forces, the UN said on Wednesday, while thousands more have been displaced by the violence. M23, or the March 23 Movement, seized Goma, the largest city in eastern Congo, after three days of fierce battles with Congolese forces - the worst escalation of fighting in more than a decade. Despite announcing a unilateral ceasefire, they have continued to move south towards the city of Bukavu. Its rebellion is driven partly by Rwandan concerns that rebels opposed to Mr Kagame's regime have been allowed to be active in largely lawless parts of eastern Congo by the much larger country's military. The Rwandan president has accused his Congolese counterpart of ignoring the legitimate concerns of DRC's Tutsis who face discrimination. Fighting has centred on the North Kivu province, where M23 is mostly active and which borders both Uganda and Rwanda. Also known as the Congolese Revolutionary Army, M23 is a Congolese Tutsi-led rebel military group based in mineral-rich eastern parts of the DRC. Congo has deployed SADC peacekeepers, but Rwanda has claimed the troops are making the situation in North Kivu worse. Mr Kagame has said using SADC troops in eastern Congo cannot be called a peaceful effort as they are fighting alongside Congolese forces against the M23 militia. Some 4,000 Rwandan troops are supporting M23 rebels in North Kivu, according to the UN. Kenyan President William Ruto, in his opening remarks, told delegates \"the lives of millions\" were hanging on their ability to solve a \"complex and challenging situation with wisdom, clarity of mind, empathy\". \"Dialogue is not a sign of weakness,\" he said. \"We must encourage all parties to put aside their differences and mobilise for engagements in constructive dialogue.\" Read more:Ukraine offers Trump minerals dealIsrael-Hamas prisoner exchange latest Mr Tshisekedi has previously rejected calls for direct talks with M23.

Justice department official Brett Shumate told Judge Nichols that about 2,200 USAID employees would be put on paid leave under the administration's plans.  \"The president has decided there is corruption and fraud at USAID,\" said Mr Shumate. It echoes comments President Trump made on Friday in a post on Truth Social accusing USAID - without evidence - of corruption and spending money fraudulently.

        "Content": "Demi Moore, Zoe Saldana, Kieran Culkin and Adrien Brody are among the big winners of this year's Critics Choice Awards. Moore took home the best actress award for her performance in The Substance, in which she plays a fading Oscar winner who discovers a black-market drug to create a younger model of herself. The prize adds to her Golden Globe win and Oscar nomination in what has been her first acknowledgement for major Hollywood awards, after decades in the business. \"This has been such a wild ride, I can't tell you when I started this journey on this film, I could never imagine being here,\" the 62-year-old said as she collected her award at the ceremony in Santa Monica, Los Angeles. \"This is so far beyond anything I could have hoped for.\" The actress, who is now an Oscars frontrunner, added: \"For anybody out there who is still on their journey, who is still struggling to find their way... because it hasn't happened, it doesn't mean it isn't happening - dreams do come true.\" Coralie Fargeat, the filmmaker behind The Substance, also collected the award for best original screenplay, while the film also picked up a third prize for hair and make-up. Anora, a film about a sex worker who marries the son of a Russian oligarch, was named best picture, while papal thriller Conclave, which stars Ralph Fiennes, Stanley Tucci and Isabella Rossellini, picked up the gong for best acting ensemble. Blockbuster musical adaptation Wicked picked up three prizes, including best director for John M Chu. Brody, another Golden Globe winner and Oscars favourite, was named best actor for his performance as a Hungarian-Jewish architect in The Brutalist, while Saldana and Culkin won awards in the supporting categories for their roles in Emilia Perez and A Real Pain respectively. Emilia Perez, a Spanish-language musical thriller about a Mexican drug lord who changes gender, was also named best foreign language film and was honoured for best song for El Mal, which features Saldana, Karla Sofia Gascon and Camille Dalmais. The film leads the nominations for this year's Oscars, but has faced controversy in recent weeks after old social media posts by Gascon, taking aim at Islam and George Floyd, came to light. Deadpool & Wolverine, starring Hollywood actors Ryan Reynolds and Hugh Jackman, shared the best comedy prize with A Real Pain, in which Culkin and director Jesse Eisenberg play cousins visiting Poland to honour their grandmother. Reynolds shared news of the win on Instagram, writing: \"Zing! Thanks Critics Choice - whole team is thrilled. But wait a minute.\" He then encouraged followers to \"swipe\" to see A Real Pain had also collected the award, and wished the film's cast and crew a \"huge congrats\". 'Thank you, Justin Baldoni and Blake Lively...' Reynolds' wife Blake Lively was the subject of a joke by awards host Chelsea Handler during her opening monologue, following the recent controversy involving the actress and her It Ends With Us co-star and director Justin Baldoni. \"I want to acknowledge that we've been through a lot lately, not just here in Los Angeles, but our entire country,\" Handler said. \"Waking up every day, not knowing what news we are going to hear that will disappoint or horrify us. \"So, it is important in times like these to have a distraction. And that's why I want to personally extend my gratitude... to Justin Baldoni and Blake Lively. Thank you for providing us with that distraction. I'm grateful. I think we're all grateful.\" Read more:Kieran Culkin on A Real Pain: 'I'd get defensive'The film opening the conversation about sex workConclave: 'It's not a facile takedown of the Catholic Church' In the TV categories, historical drama Shogun, which is set in Japan, dominated the drama section, taking home the best drama award and three of the four acting prizes for stars Hiroyuki Sanada, Moeka Hoshi and Tadanobu Asano. Hacks was named best comedy series, with star Jean Smart named best comedy actress, while Baby Reindeer was named best limited series and star Jessica Gunning named best supporting actress. The awards ceremony took place on Friday after being postponed numerous times due to the wildfires that broke out across Los Angeles in January."

        "Content": "By Mark Kleinman, City editor  Legal & General (L&G), the FTSE-100 insurance and asset management group, is preparing to kick off a search for a successor to chairman Sir John Kingman. Sky News has learnt that the company, which this week announced a major corporate deal in the US, is close to appointing headhunters to oversee the appointment process. City sources said this weekend that Sir John was likely to step down from the L&G board and retire as chairman at its annual meeting next year. That timetable will give the company, which will mark its bicentenary in just over a decade, about 15 months to identify and appoint its next chair. It was unclear on Saturday whether any of L&G's existing non-executive directors would be in contention for the role. Sir John has become one of the City's most prominent figures over the last decade, having been a surprise appointment in 2016 to replace interim chair Rudy Markham. Since then, he has become chairman of Barclays' UK ring-fenced bank subsidiary, which replaced an earlier role he held as chairman of Tesco Bank. \n                  Money blog: Exactly how much more it costs being single revealed\n                 \n                  'Ghost broking': Reports of scammers selling fake car insurance rise by 30% over five years\n                 \n                  Billions for 'unproven' carbon capture technology will have 'very significant' impact on energy bills, MPs warn\n                 He also presided over a landmark review of audit regulation in the UK in the aftermath of accounting scandals at companies such as BHS and Carillion. Prior to his career in business, Sir John was a long-serving Whitehall mandarin, playing a leading role to Britain's response to the 2008 financial crisis. Following the bailouts of Lloyds Banking Group and Royal Bank of Scotland - now NatWest Group - he was named the first chief executive of UK Financial Investments, the agency set up to manage the taxpayer's bank stakes. While in that role, he oversaw the effective defenestration of Sir Victor Blank as Lloyds' chair - a move which stunned the City. Following that, he moved to Rothschild as an investment banker. For most of Sir John's tenure as L&G chair, the company was run by Sir Nigel Wilson, who oversaw a big push by the company into financing urban regeneration projects across the UK, and expanding its pension risk transfer business. Sir Nigel's successor, the former HSBC and Santander executive Antonio Simoes, has announced a number of efforts to slim down the group's operations. He sold Cala Homes last year for £1.4bn, and on Friday announced the sale of L&G's US insurance business to its partner, Japan's Meiji Yasuda, for $2.3bn. As part of the deal, Meiji Yasuda will also acquire a 5% stake in the FTSE-100 group. L&G said it would expand its share buyback programme by £1bn once the deal closes. L&G said in December when it announced a series of board changes that Henrietta Baldock, who was named senior independent director-designate, would \"lead the Board succession process for the Chair\". It has not made a public announcement about the timing of the recruitment process to replace Sir John. On Friday, shares in L&G closed about 1.2% higher at 241.7p, giving the company a market capitalisation of £14.24bn. An L&G spokesperson declined to comment further."

        "Content": "\n          Asia correspondent\n              @CordeliaSkyNews\n  For weeks now, most of the friends and families I know have had a cough of some kind. The pollution in the dry season in Thailand has long been a problem. But recently, it's reached dangerous and deeply worrying levels. Bangkok was the fourth most polluted city in the world this month. Across 31 districts 352 schools were also closed because of pollution. For weeks, I've had to rush my children into school with masks on, as the cheery teachers apologetically declare: \"Pollution day so straight into class please.\" I like to go running with my son before school. But these days we've had to check the air quality index before we venture out. Unfortunately, there have been plenty of mornings when the red bar appears, the screen reads, \"very unhealthy\" and we have to stay in. It's not a ritual I ever imagined having to go through with my kids in an era when governments know full well the dangers of pollutants and have the technology and know-how to reduce it. \n                  Lead pollution in ancient Rome may have lowered IQ levels, study finds\n                 \n                  Air pollution now linked to hospital admissions for mental health, study finds\n                 \n                  Ella Adoo-Kissi-Debrah: Ministers apologise to mother of girl who died after exposure to excessive air pollution \n                 Pollution is linked to the deaths of 100 children under five daily in South East Asia and the Pacific, according to a report this week by UNICEF. This when clean air should be a universal right. I've started to really worry about what living in Bangkok and many other parts of Thailand is doing to little lungs long term. You can feel the smog in the back of your throat and sometimes, you can see the haze. But other days it's hidden - a silent killer. 'Rainmaker' The Thai government hopes a plane that's become known as the \"rainmaker\" might help. In Hua Hin, about a three hour drive south of Bangkok, we get on board for a flight back to the capital. Two big plastic containers are being filled with 1,000 litres of icy water through a pump. Today they're dropping it over 16km of land shrouded in pollution. They do it twice a day across the country. It’s an unconventional method and critics say so far unproven, but the hope is that it will cool down the warm air below and help disperse the trapped polluted particles cloaking the city. The big worry right now is the PM 2.5 levels - cancer-causing particles that get into the lungs and bloodstream. Recently, they were eight times what the World Health Organization recommends. Pollution 'getting worse every year' Pilot Aim Suracharttumrongrat tells me: \"It's a very huge scale problem. Our mission here is one of helping. But it's not solving the problem.\" He gestures out the window to show how hard it is to see. \"I'm very surprised,\" he says of how bad the pollution currently is. \"It's higher every year.\" A couple of hours drive away in Ratchaburi province, you can see a big part of the problem - burnt fields of rice, sugar cane and corn - the product of slash-and-burn farming. It's a cheap and efficient way for poor farmers to clear the land, and they're encouraged by big businesses driving up demand. International smog and toxic traffic It's not the only problem. Toxic traffic is playing its part too. The government has been trying to counter that by offering free public transport. Winds from China and India have also contributed to the recent haze - earlier and more intense than previous years. The government has rules in place against burning crops. But punishments aren't always enforced and if Thailand and other countries are serious about improving the situation, holding big agricultural companies to account will be key. China and Singapore are two nations that have turned things around. Read more from Sky News:Trump faces choice in new space racePlane crashes into vehicles on busy roadRiver in Argentina turns bright red Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra recently admitted despite adopting a wide range of measures, air quality is still bad. She said she had personally raised the issue of transboundary smog with ASEAN foreign ministers. But Thailand will arguably have to go much further than that if it's to turn things around - in policy and practice."

After Liam and Noel Gallagher announced a limited run of stadium shows last summer, thousands of fans logged on to Ticketmaster in hopes of seeing the band play live for the first time since 2009. However, the event company is currently under investigation over their use of dynamic pricing - which saw prices for a standard ticket double from £148 to £355. Several fans have now said that they received emails from Ticketmaster which claimed the use of bots was identified in their ticket purchases and cancelled them as a result. Leighah Conroy, 24, had bought four tickets to see Oasis perform at Heaton Park in Manchester on 28 August last year - but was told on Friday that Ticketmaster \"identified that bots were used to make this purchase\". She told the PA news agency: \"To say that we're bots is totally out of order for Ticketmaster because we tried all day to get the tickets. \"Our heads have been pretty battered these past 24 hours. I felt sick in the stomach. It's a band you'll never experience or see again and it's been on my bucket list for years. \"It just feels like my dreams have been completely crushed.\" Ms Conroy, from Cumbria, paid around £150 per ticket, and also spent £800 on a hotel and a further £40 for travel to the show. Marta Bonnet, 48, from Spain, also said she received the same email on Friday. She said she spent more than £3,000 on tickets, flights and accommodation for herself, her husband and her children to see Oasis at Wembley Stadium on 3 August. \"At first we thought this email was fake or a spam email, but no it was true,\" she added. \"We usually use Ticketmaster to buy our tickets... But now, how can I trust this page which is supposed to be the official page? \"I really can't believe what has happened.\" A spokesperson for Ticketmaster said: \"Anyone who has been contacted and believes a refund was made in error has been sent a form to fill in for the tour's promoters to review.\" Read more:Oasis announce more dates on world tourHappy Mondays stars give thoughts on dynamic pricing The Competition and Markets Authority said in September that it had launched an investigation into Ticketmaster's Oasis gigs sale - calling for evidence from fans.

Oasis will begin their reunion tour on 4 July in Cardiff before playing another 16 dates in the UK and Ireland. The tour then moves to Canada, the US, Mexico, and Australia."

        "Headline": "A flawed protagonist with a penchant for big knickers, Bridget Jones may be unlucky in love, but she's been stealing the hearts of fans for nearly three decades. Why, like Mark Darcy, do we love her just the way she is?",
        "Content": "\n          Arts and entertainment reporter\n              @BethanyMinelle\n A perennial singleton among the smug marrieds, with a passion for Chardonnay, big knickers and emotional f***wits. Who is Bridget Jones and why is she beloved by so many? Created by Helen Fielding as an anonymous way to write about being a single girl in London, Bridget first came to life in a weekly column in the Independent. Fielding didn't think it would last six weeks. She was very wrong, and Bridget Jones is still alive and kicking nearly three decades later with four novels, four movies and a legion of fans worldwide. First off, we have to pay homage to Jane Austen. Without Pride And Prejudice, Bridget Jones wouldn't exist. The entire plot line of Bridget Jones's Diary is built around the love triangle of Elizabeth Bennett, the dashing but aloof Mr Darcy and the absolute cad Mr Wickham - but retold in1990s London with Bridget, Mark Darcy and Daniel Cleaver. As a drinking, smoking, swearing and non-corset-wearing Elizabeth Bennett, Bridget was a big hit. Set loose in the capital in the hedonistic '90s, there was plenty of fun to be had, and plenty to poke fun at. \n                  Lockerbie: A Search for Truth - Six things to know about the series\n                 \n                  Colin Firth's shirt from Pride And Prejudice sells for more than double auction estimate\n                 \n                  Empire Of Light stars Olivia Colman, Colin Firth, Micheal Ward and Toby Jones on making Sam Mendes's love letter to cinema\n                 Created pre-social media, we can only imagine a world in which Bridget was documenting her weight and alcohol units on TikTok instead of in her diary... The first movie There was a media meltdown when American actress Renee Zellweger was cast as Bridget Jones, and the fact she put on 25lbs for the role was front-page news for months. It's fair to say the obsession with Zellweger's weight has pretty much continued to this day. With life imitating art, while Bridget religiously notes her weight every day in her diary, the world became obsessed with Zellweger's own size - very much proving the point that her character's obsessive relationship with the scales reflected society's obsession with female appearance. Of course, we don't know how tall Bridget is, so despite knowing her daily calorie intake and weight to the pound, we have no idea how big or small she actually is, just her own perception of her size. Meanwhile, qualms over how convincing Zellweger would be at pulling off a British accent were quickly quashed when she nailed it, with the help of the same voice coach who worked with Gwyneth Paltrow on Shakespeare In Love. It's faultless. Brat Bridget and feminist Marmite Bridget was Brat long before Brat was a thing. Smoking like a chimney, with a questionable dress sense and sporting hair that - unlike pretty much 99% of films - looks messy and real, Bridget was relatable and became an instant icon to many women - particularly those over 35 - who felt largely ignored by society. However, the character was feminist Marmite - while some loved Bridget, others hated her and everything she stood for. Some felt her obsession with her appearance and finding a man flew in the face of what it meant to be an independent woman - and everything the first waves of the feminist movement had fought for. Others thought that for a generation that had been told they could have it all, Bridget's battles to try to achieve all that society told her she should, were a valiant attempt to triumph in an impossible situation. Principled, honest and unwaveringly kind - while Bridget may not have been perfect, in an era of heroin chic, lad mags and outrageously unrealistic beauty standards, there were plenty less wholesome role models for young women to aspire to. Pre-MeToo world The first books and films came to life in a pre-MeToo world and boy do you know it - there's lots of bum-pinching, and inappropriate comments in the office and beyond. Mr Tits Pervert was not an anomaly. Helen Fielding has since said she was shocked when rewatching to note the amount of inappropriate behaviour Bridget has to put up with. Each film has a structure running from the end of one year, through Christmas and New Year, and looking ahead to a new start.  Nostalgic soundtracks are a staple, with lip-synced favourites a mainstay of every film. If you've never cried into your wine glass while singing All By Myself, you've never lived. The films also have a largely returning cast - who like Bridget have been in our lives for years. Watching them grow up from movie to movie - as we do too - is part of the joy. We also get to look forward to a 'Mr Darcy in the lake moment' in every film - be it in a river, an aqua aerobic pre-natal class or a pond, with the latest re-enactment courtesy of a half-naked Leo Woodall - who incidentally was born in the year the first novel was published. The fight scenes in the first two films have also become something of a cultural touchstone, largely thanks to the fact that middle-aged men ineffectually kicking each other while hopping around is rarely portrayed on the silver screen. The second film Bridget Jones: The Edge Of Reason sees Bridget continue her unbelievably lucky streak when it comes to jobs. While she started out as a PR in a publishing house (most notably promoting the highbrow read Kafka's Motorbike) she then stumbled into TV production, which quickly and inexplicably segued into becoming a TV presenter. In this movie she lands the dream role of a travel presenter, despite a complete lack of geographical knowledge, and it provides the basis of the plot which revolves around getting stranded in Thailand after accidentally smuggling drugs. We can't ignore some issues around this one, not least scenes in a Thai jail in which Bridget sings some Madonna and then hands out bras and chocolate before being freed by Mark Darcy. The movie faced criticism for perpetuating \"white saviour\" stereotypes, and is not Bridget's finest moment.

The third film Bridget Jones meets Three Men And A Baby in the third movie Bridget Jones's Baby, with the novel actually following the film rather than vice versa. It was based on articles written by Fielding in 2005. Spoiler alert - Hugh Grant wasn't up for this one. Luckily, Patrick Dempsey - the man who played Dr McDreamy in Grey's Anatomy - stepped in. It good-naturedly cracks through the challenges of having a baby as a geriatric, single-working mum and somehow picking the right guy at the end of it all. Bridget gets her fairytale wedding, her man and of course becomes a mum. While the first couple of films contained more smoking than would be believed, this one saw the franchise ditch the habit, a reflection both of Bridget's new responsibilities and the changing fashions of the time. While Grant sat this one out, there was hope for fans that he would return thanks to a cheeky front-page splash at the end of the film declaring him alive and well a year after he was presumed dead following a plane crash (in the bush). The fourth film It's not quite a full-on reunion for the fourth film - but almost. Bridget's life has taken some unexpected turns, and while Daniel Cleaver may have risen from the dead, there is a new and much bigger hole in her life. You will need to take tissues into this one, unless you have a heart of stone. While past casts have been notable for their lack of diversity, this one also looks a bit more like the multicultural capital Bridget lives in. Bridget now has a shelf full of diaries and wry observances include a takedown of the dismissal of \"women of a certain age\", a lip-filler-esque fail that pokes fun at attempts to cheat age and the baffling modern phenomenon of buttonless lifts. The end of an era? Is this the end for Bridget? For now. The exploration of her life from her early 30s to her mid-50s has seen her find love, forge a career and have a family. But it's not out of the question we could venture into the next stages of her life at some point. Helen Fielding is still writing books, just not about Bridget. With a new legion of Gen Z fans now introduced to - and loving - Bridget, never say never. And while Bridget may have found her happy ever after - all fans of the books will know It is a truth universally acknowledged that when one part of your life starts going okay, another falls spectacularly to pieces. So, watch this space."

        "Content": "Demi Moore, Zoe Saldana, Kieran Culkin and Adrien Brody are among the big winners of this year's Critics Choice Awards. Moore took home the best actress award for her performance in The Substance, in which she plays a fading Oscar winner who discovers a black-market drug to create a younger model of herself. The prize adds to her Golden Globe win and Oscar nomination in what has been her first acknowledgement for major Hollywood awards, after decades in the business. \"This has been such a wild ride, I can't tell you when I started this journey on this film, I could never imagine being here,\" the 62-year-old said as she collected her award at the ceremony in Santa Monica, Los Angeles. \"This is so far beyond anything I could have hoped for.\" The actress, who is now an Oscars frontrunner, added: \"For anybody out there who is still on their journey, who is still struggling to find their way... because it hasn't happened, it doesn't mean it isn't happening - dreams do come true.\" Coralie Fargeat, the filmmaker behind The Substance, also collected the award for best original screenplay, while the film also picked up a third prize for hair and make-up. Anora, a film about a sex worker who marries the son of a Russian oligarch, was named best picture, while papal thriller Conclave, which stars Ralph Fiennes, Stanley Tucci and Isabella Rossellini, picked up the gong for best acting ensemble. Blockbuster musical adaptation Wicked picked up three prizes, including best director for John M Chu. Brody, another Golden Globe winner and Oscars favourite, was named best actor for his performance as a Hungarian-Jewish architect in The Brutalist, while Saldana and Culkin won awards in the supporting categories for their roles in Emilia Perez and A Real Pain respectively. Emilia Perez, a Spanish-language musical thriller about a Mexican drug lord who changes gender, was also named best foreign language film and was honoured for best song for El Mal, which features Saldana, Karla Sofia Gascon and Camille Dalmais. The film leads the nominations for this year's Oscars, but has faced controversy in recent weeks after old social media posts by Gascon, taking aim at Islam and George Floyd, came to light. Deadpool & Wolverine, starring Hollywood actors Ryan Reynolds and Hugh Jackman, shared the best comedy prize with A Real Pain, in which Culkin and director Jesse Eisenberg play cousins visiting Poland to honour their grandmother. Reynolds shared news of the win on Instagram, writing: \"Zing! Thanks Critics Choice - whole team is thrilled. But wait a minute.\" He then encouraged followers to \"swipe\" to see A Real Pain had also collected the award, and wished the film's cast and crew a \"huge congrats\". 'Thank you, Justin Baldoni and Blake Lively...' Reynolds' wife Blake Lively was the subject of a joke by awards host Chelsea Handler during her opening monologue, following the recent controversy involving the actress and her It Ends With Us co-star and director Justin Baldoni. \"I want to acknowledge that we've been through a lot lately, not just here in Los Angeles, but our entire country,\" Handler said. \"Waking up every day, not knowing what news we are going to hear that will disappoint or horrify us. \"So, it is important in times like these to have a distraction. And that's why I want to personally extend my gratitude... to Justin Baldoni and Blake Lively. Thank you for providing us with that distraction. I'm grateful. I think we're all grateful.\" Read more:Kieran Culkin on A Real Pain: 'I'd get defensive'The film opening the conversation about sex workConclave: 'It's not a facile takedown of the Catholic Church' In the TV categories, historical drama Shogun, which is set in Japan, dominated the drama section, taking home the best drama award and three of the four acting prizes for stars Hiroyuki Sanada, Moeka Hoshi and Tadanobu Asano. Hacks was named best comedy series, with star Jean Smart named best comedy actress, while Baby Reindeer was named best limited series and star Jessica Gunning named best supporting actress. The awards ceremony took place on Friday after being postponed numerous times due to the wildfires that broke out across Los Angeles in January."

        "Content": "\n          Entertainment reporter\n              @Debbie_Ridgard\n  Relocating to a luxurious hotel in Thailand for six months sounds like a job only conceivable through a dream or a stroke of good fortune. Season three of The White Lotus awarded that luxury to its cast and crew which, this time around, includes Sex Education's Aimee Lou Wood, The Fallout's Walton Goggins and Gen V star Patrick Schwarzenegger among others. Mission: Impossible star Michelle Monaghan plays Jaclyn on the show, a woman on a \"girls' trip\" consumed with the competing power dynamic between the group. Speaking to Sky News, Monaghan called her time on the series - filmed in Thailand - a \"once in a lifetime opportunity\". \"[My family] came over and we got to have adventures, and it was just a very, very special time. I've been doing this for 25 years and this kind of takes the cake. \"They are their own little adventurers themselves, and they love the water so obviously, we're in Thailand, we all went and got our diving certificates. We spent a lot of time diving together and we really bonded in new and different ways.\" Bafta winner Aimee Lou Wood's experience differed slightly. \n                  Oasis fans say Ticketmaster cancelled orders over 'bot' claims\n                 \n                  Bridget Jones: A heroine of our time or an absolute disgrace?\n                 \n                  Demi Moore continues winning streak at Critics Choice Awards - as Zoe Saldana and Adrien Brody also take home top prizes\n                 Adjusting to a new country alone during, what she says, felt like a big moment of change in her life moving flat and turning thirty. \"It was obviously incredible. But yeah, I was really overwhelmed. I was so overwhelmed and I kind of remained overwhelmed. \"I had this amazing adventure, but I missed home. But then when I was at home, I really missed the adventure. And I also missed my friends that I've made in The White Lotus because they did become home.\" The actress says she went straight out to meet her friends the moment she returned to the UK after filming. \"I was crying at the beautiful London litter. I was like 'It's just the most gorgeous place, London'. And it was probably me crying at a bin, but it was just home.\" Television show boosts tourism Similar to Emily In Paris, The White Lotus has become somewhat of a featured advert for each of the Four Seasons hotels, where filming takes place, as well as the surrounding area. If season three follows in the footsteps of its predecessors, which were set in Hawaii and Sicily, the number of visitors to Thailand is expected to grow by 20% thanks to television tourism. HBO partnered with the Tourism Authority of Thailand during production, filming in and around the Four Seasons Koh Samui and the neighbouring Phuket and Bangkok. Who's in The White Lotus? The latest season of the hit show sees series one alumna Natasha Rothwell return with a whole new cast: Jason Isaacs, Walton Goggins, Aimee Lou Wood, Michelle Monaghan, Carrie Coon, Leslie Bibb, Patrick Schwarzenegger, Sam Nivola and Parker Posey. Rothwell reprises her role as Belinda Lindsey from season one - the spa manager eager to create her own business. The American actress received a call from the show's creator Mike White about the possibility of returning for another season and says she was in disbelief when he officially asked her to return.
