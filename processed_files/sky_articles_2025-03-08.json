        "Content": "By Deborah Haynes, security and defence editor, and Azad Safarov, Ukraine producer   It \"cuts my heart\" and is a \"betrayal\". This was the response of a Ukrainian soldier in a frontline combat regiment directly affected by Donald Trump's decision to pause US military support to Ukraine. Serhii, 45, maintains a unit of US-supplied Bradley infantry fighting vehicles that are defending an area of eastern Ukraine from attacking Russian forces. The halt to American military aid - if sustained - means there will be no new ammunition and no ability to repair any of the vehicles when they are damaged - a constant risk. Ukraine war latest: Follow live updates On a recent mission by the 425th Storming Regiment \"Skala\", three Bradleys went into battle towards the direction of the city of Pokrovsk, an area of heavy clashes. Only two returned after the other was hit by the Russian side. \"It's going to be very hard,\" Serhii said, standing next to a large Bradley, covered by a camouflage net and tucked under a line of trees in the Donetsk region. \"These vehicles are really good. You can fight back with them. And not just defend, you can even advance. It's a shame we didn't have this equipment two or three years ago.\"  The regiment has been using Bradleys for a number of months. Serhii is the lead mechanic. The tracked vehicles, armed with a chain gun that can fire 200 rounds per minute, were first developed in the 1980s but have been fitted with modern reactive armour that means they can survive drone strikes, rocket attacks and the shrapnel from artillery rounds. \"The vehicle's protection… is fantastic,\" Serhii said, with clear admiration for the equipment compared with Soviet-era fighting vehicles that many Ukrainian troops have to use. He said the crew of one of his Bradleys was hit by two rocket-propelled grenades but was able to continue driving and was unharmed. Serhii, who comes from the Donetsk region, said he felt betrayed by Mr Trump's decision to halt such crucial support. The US president ordered the move as he attempts to put pressure on Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to negotiate a ceasefire deal with Russia. \"Although I'm not a politician, it's a betrayal for us, for the guys who are defending Ukraine,\" the soldier said. Asked how he felt when he heard the news about the US president's decision, Serhii said: \"The latest news cuts my heart, I can answer you that way. It cuts my heart... If politicians solve issues this way, just by halting weapons supply in one move, that's criminal.\" He signalled it would be harder for Ukrainian troops to defend their land without the US military support - but they would still fight. \"Even without this weapon, we believe we will move forward,\" he said. \"They [the Russians] have to retreat, no matter what. The guys didn't take up arms here for nothing, and they stand together. Together, all of us, as one, will defeat this enemy.\" As for whether he had a message for Mr Trump, the soldier said: \"Don't stop military aid. Politics is politics, but the people, I believe, are the most important. \"It will be very hard for us without such equipment. This equipment is good; it allows us to show results. And we will keep showing them. We've shown them before and we will keep showing them. That's how it is. Thank you.\" Fighting 'for my motherland' Sky News watched as two crews prepared their fighting vehicles for a potential mission on Thursday evening. Sedoi, 41, commands one of the Bradleys and operates the gun. He said the American-supplied vehicle gives him confidence when he goes into battle - and was also likely a scary prospect for Russian troops to have to encounter. \"We make a lot of noise. Everything catches fire and burns... It's a good vehicle,\" he said.  Sedoi said he did not have a reaction to the news about the halt to American military support, saying: \"I don't get involved in their politics.\" However, he signalled he did want an end to the war - even if it meant Russia keeping some of the land it has seized. \"Let it end, so people stop dying. Because a lot of people have died,\" he said. Read more:Russia has 'all the cards' in negotiationsRussia 'appears to have ignored Trump warning' Recently recovered from a shrapnel wound, Sedoi said he volunteered to fight after Vladimir Putin launched his full-scale war more than three years ago because of Russia's brutality. \"I've heard what they do when they enter villages, what they do with children and women… I don't want them to go any further... That's why I'm here. \"But, to be honest, I'm getting tired of it.\" Yet still he and his fellow soldiers battle on. Asked why he was fighting, the soldier said: \"For my motherland.\""

Lisa Smith, 43, was killed after she was shot outside The Three Horseshoes in Knockholt on the evening of Friday 14 February. Later that night, the suspect, named as Edvard Smith, was believed to have fallen into the Thames from the Queen Elizabeth II Bridge which crosses the river at Dartford 17 miles away. Around that time, the suspect's car containing a handgun was found abandoned on the bridge and a man was seen on the wrong side of the barrier.

The force has now said a body was found in the Thames near Rainham in Essex on Friday afternoon. It has not been formally identified but the suspect's family have been told of the development. Edvard Smith was known to Ms Smith and there had been no prior contact between the police and the victim or suspect. 'So much commotion' Following the shooting, the landlady of The Three Horseshoes, Michelle Thomas, told Sky News she heard two loud bangs that she initially \"thought were fireworks\" on the night of the attack. She said there was \"so much commotion - screaming, shouting, crying\" and the shooting had left the community in \"absolute shock\".  She said Ms Smith, from Slough, had been to the pub before, \"mostly in the summer\" but \"wasn't a regular\". Ms Thomas also said about 30 people were at the pub for dinner, while 20 more were in the bar as the incident unfolded just after 7pm.

        "Content": "\n          Chief political correspondent\n              @joncraig\n  The bitter war of words between Nigel Farage and Reform MP Rupert Lowe has dramatically escalated with the pair launching fierce new personal attacks on each other. Mr Farage revealed accusations of bullying by Mr Lowe and accused him of falling out with all his fellow Reform UK MPs, with too many \"outbursts\" using \"inappropriate language\". And he took the highly unusual step of quoting a Labour minister, Mike Kane, who said after a confrontation with Mr Lowe in the Commons that his anger \"showed a man not in charge of his own faculties\". On Friday, party chairman and Farage lieutenant Zia Yusuf and chief whip Lee Anderson MP disclosed accusations that two female workers had complained of \"serious bullying\" in Mr Lowe's offices, and said he had been reported to police over allegations he threatened Mr Yusuf with physical violence. Mr Lowe, who has been suspended by the parliamentary party, denied the claims. The worsening of the feud between the Reform UK leader and the millionaire MP for Great Yarmouth came in articles in The Sunday Telegraph in which they both furiously attacked each other. Lowe alleges 'witch hunt' \n                  Suspended Reform UK MP Rupert Lowe, who allegedly threatened violence, invites Nigel Farage to dinner\n                 \n                  Reform UK MP Rupert Lowe reported to police over alleged threats towards party chairman\n                 \n                  A pact between Nigel Farage and Kemi Badenoch?\n                 Mr Lowe stepped up his verbal onslaught on Mr Farage by claiming that a \"witch hunt\" against him risked destroying Reform's attempts at removing Labour from power. And he claimed that at a time when Reform UK's poll ratings were rising the attacks on him by the party would be a turn-off to voters, declaring: \"Infighting failed the Tories - and it's failing Reform.\" Mr Farage also began his Telegraph article by claiming: \"If the last general election taught us anything, it is that the public does not like political parties that engage in constant infighting.\" But he claimed that thanks to Mr Lowe \"unloading a barrage of criticisms against our operations and its main actors\", Reform's unity has been dented. 'Containment strategies invariably fail' Mr Farage said Mr Lowe had \"managed to fall out with all his parliamentary colleagues in one way or another\", adding: \"We did our best to keep a lid on things but, in the end, containment strategies invariably fail.\" He then referred to a Commons clash with Mr Kane just before Christmas, after Mr Lowe staged a debate about a damaged ship containing toxic cargo docked in his Great Yarmouth constituency. \"Mr Lowe was unhappy with the answer that he received from Mr Kane and, at the end of the debate, he crossed the floor to make his feelings known,\" Mr Farage wrote. \"A confrontation ensued. Heated language was heard. The minister's shoulder was pushed. In the end, the Serjeant at Arms had to step in to calm things down between the two parliamentarians. \"Commenting on Mr Lowe's conduct later, Mr Kane (said) 'the anger displayed towards me clearly showed a man not in charge of his own faculties'. Nobody in Reform UK said anything publicly about what had happened. Instead, we carried on. \"Yet the fact is that, sadly, there have been too many similar outbursts from Mr Lowe, often involving the use of inappropriate language, to the despair of our chief whip, Lee Anderson. \"I have been surprised and saddened at this behaviour. Certainly, I never saw anything like it in the European Parliament in 2019 when I was the leader of the Brexit Party and Mr Lowe was an MEP colleague.\" Read more:Lowe invites Farage to dinnerFarage gives up sole control of ReformParty passes 200,000 members On bullying allegations, Mr Farage wrote: \"Last week, the chairman of Reform UK, Zia Yusuf, showed me two letters sent by female members of staff to our party headquarters. Each letter contained an accusation of workplace bullying involving Mr Lowe. \"One of the incidents in question is alleged to have taken place within the parliamentary estate. Both women's letters stated that these allegations had been reported to the parliamentary authorities. \"As a responsible political party, Reform UK has a duty of care to every single member of staff, whether they are employed by us directly or indirectly. \"With that in mind, I believe that our chairman was entirely right for Reform to appoint a KC to conduct an independent inquiry. It is inconceivable that we could simply ignore such allegations.\" 'I will not tolerate these falsehoods' In his Telegraph article, Mr Lowe repeated his claim that there is no credible evidence against him and he was removed from the party before any investigation had started. \"I will not tolerate these falsehoods, and discussions have already taken place with my legal team,\" he wrote. \"Is it a surprise that these allegations were made public the day after I made reasonable criticisms of Nigel Farage and the Reform leadership? \"It is a witch hunt, plain for all to see. I have been entirely frozen out of the Reform machine over the last few months, in a deliberate and calculated way.\" Without naming Mr Farage, deputy leader Richard Tice or Mr Yusuf, he said the Reform UK leadership was unable even to accept the most mild constructive criticism. Turning on Mr Yusuf, he wrote: \"The allegations against me from the chairman relate to an incident in December, but he only reported them to the police the day after my reasonable questioning was published. \"Take from that what you will. I don't feel sorry for myself. I feel sorry for the millions of decent British men and women who put their faith in Reform. They deserve better than this vicious charade.\" 👉 Click here to listen to Electoral Dysfunction on your podcast app 👈 And warning of the damage the feuding was causing, Mr Lowe said: \"Everything has been put at risk. Everything. The future of the Right in Britain is now in peril. How can Reform claim to be a party awaiting government when they can't even follow basic process? \"Reform has been rising in the polls for months. But this spectre of infighting will leave the party looking unserious and turn voters off. Infighting failed the Tories - and it's failing Reform.\" But Mr Lowe concluded with an olive branch. \"On multiple occasions, I have invited Nigel Farage for dinner over the last few months,\" he revealed. \"Every single one has been refused or ignored. \"Again, I offer a public invitation to Nigel. Let's have dinner and resolve this in the matter that our members, supporters and country would expect. Any time, any place.\" He added: \"I want Reform to be professional, to be fair, to be serious. We must offer a credible alternative to the uniparty that has so failed so spectacularly. \"The leadership's behaviour this week has undermined that cause, not only in the eyes of the electorate, but also in those of serious individuals across business and industry that any party of government needs to win over.\""

Writing to mark Commonwealth Day on Monday, the King, as Head of the Commonwealth, will say: \"In these uncertain times, where it is all too easy to believe that our differences are problems instead of a source of strength and an opportunity for learning, the Commonwealth's remarkable collection of nations and peoples come together in the spirit of support and, crucially, friendship.\" But emphasising his confidence in the relevance of the family of nations, he will add: \"The Commonwealth's ability to bring together people from all over the world has stood the test of time and remains as ever-important today.\" It comes as the King and his soft diplomatic power have been deployed in recent weeks by the government, in relation to America and Ukraine.

The death toll, reported by the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (SOHR), makes the two days of violence some of the deadliest since Syria's conflict began 14 years ago, according to the group. The government said it is responding to attacks from remnants of Assad's forces and blamed \"individual actions\" for the violence. Seven hundred and forty-five civilians were killed, mostly in massacres, as well as 148 pro-Assad fighters and 125 people from security forces, according to the British-based SOHR. No official figures have been released.  SOHR said the violence erupted on Thursday afternoon when pro-Assad militants ambushed Syrian security forces in the Latakia region, a former stronghold of the deposed leader where many of the minority Alawites, who made up his support base, live. On Friday, Sunni Muslim gunmen loyal to the government began revenge killings against members of Assad's minority Alawite sect, according to people in the region. \n                  Syria: 'Nearly 200 killed' in country's worst violence since Assad toppled\n                 \n                  A UK-conducted fatal drone strike confirmed for first time since Starmer became PM\n                 \n                  Russian ships filmed carrying military hardware through the English Channel\n                 \"They forcibly brought people down to the streets, then they lined them up and started shooting them,\" said one resident of Baniyasin on the west coast of Syria. \"They left nobody.

Other residents from Alawite communities told the Associated Press (AP) about gunmen shooting Alawites, the majority of them men, in the streets or at the gates of their homes. Many homes were looted and then set on fire, two residents of Syria's coastal region told the AP from their hideouts. The revenge killings stopped early Saturday, according to SOHR's founder Rami Abdurrahman. \"This was one of the biggest massacres during the Syrian conflict,\" Mr Abdurrahman said about the killings of Alawite civilians. Syria's state news agency said all roads leading to the coastal region have been closed \"to prevent violations and gradually restore stability\". According to SOHR, electricity and drinking water were cut off in large areas around the city of Latakia. An unnamed Defense Ministry official was quoted by the news agency as saying government forces have regained control of much of the areas from Assad loyalists. The bodies of 31 people killed in revenge attacks, including nine children and four women, the day before in the village of Tuwaym were laid to rest in a mass grave, residents said. A funeral was held for four Syrian security force members in the northwestern village of Al-Janoudiya. The previous figure given by SOHR was more than 200 dead."

        "Content": "\n          India reporter and producer\n              @nevilleskynews\n  \"It's a slow poisoning of people living here. The poison enters their bodies through the air weakening their immunity and medicines are not as effective as they should be,\" Dr Arshad Khan says.  He has been practicing for 14 years at the Mulla Colony, which is adjacent to the Ghazipur landfill. One of the largest landfills in the country, it is also called the \"garbage mountain of Delhi\". A monstrosity, an eyesore - but more than that a source of death, decay, disease and pollution for hundreds of thousands who live and work in its shadows. This trash mount is more than 200 feet high and covers an area of almost 70 acres - over 50 football pitches. Standing at the top of more than 14 million metric tonnes of waste, one gets the size and scale of this man-made disaster. Its stench is nauseating, breathing is difficult and a toxic taste engulfs the mouth and throat. \n                  Arvind Kejriwal detained: Protesters demand release of rival to Indian leader Narendra Modi\n                 \n                  Arvind Kejriwal detained: India's PM Narendra Modi criticised as protests held over political rival's arrest\n                 \n                  Man arrested after 16-year-old girl stabbed to death on Delhi street - as passers-by watched on\n                 Feasted upon by birds, flies, vermin and cattle, this 20-storey slope of waste often catches fire in toxic blazes that last for days, especially during the summer. At times parts of the over-saturated site collapses, crushing people. In September 2017, more than 50 million tonnes of garbage came crashing down burying people and vehicles. Satellite data has revealed that this site is a hotspot for methane emissions - a powerful greenhouse gas that is almost 84 times more potent in warming the atmosphere than carbon dioxide over a 20-year period. Kayrros, an energy and environmental intelligence company, shared satellite data with Sky News that showed methane emissions between November 2021 and May 2024, with an average flow rate of 2.91 tonnes per hour. The monsoon season prevents the company from capturing data during warmer months when emissions are expected to be higher. Considering the observations may be on the lower side, methane released at this constant rate amounts to approximately 25 kilotonnes annually, equivalent to the 20-year warming impact of CO2 emissions from 500,000 cars running simultaneously the whole year round. As waste decomposes, chemical reactions within it causes temperatures to rise. Methane self-ignites at high temperatures, which can easily be reached at landfill sites due to the summer heat combined with highly combustible waste like plastic. Established in 1984, the site was designed to hold up to 20 metres of waste which peaked in 2002. For decades, successive governments promised to reduce this mountain by incinerating the trash safely in a state-of-the-art plant, turning waste into electricity - but many deadlines have passed to flatten and reduce the mountain. Delhi generates over 11,000 tonnes of waste daily. Only a small amount of this is incinerated, producing power, while the rest is dumped on the landfills.

He said: \"I have only seen it grow, all governments have promised to solve this problem but do nothing. Every person living around it is getting sick, and it's difficult to breathe. I am a heart patient and have breathing difficulties.\" Parveen Khatum, 44, finds it difficult to breathe and her body often breaks out in boils and blisters. \"My body is drying up, I'm less than half my size now, I have difficulty breathing and gets more difficult if I lie down. I feel very anxious and my head and limbs hurt.\" A few months ago 45-year-old Ansarul Khan was diagnosed with fourth-stage cancer of the lungs and liver. A father of five, the doctors have given him a few weeks or months to live. \"There is so much sickness here because of this garbage. Sometimes it's difficult to just breathe. It's frightening,\" he says. Giving up on the doctors here, his family are taking him to Mumbai for treatment. Dark streams of fluids from the landfill drain into the earth, contaminating ground and surface water. Running parallel is a canal, its water completely black with a putrid stench. Floating in it is garbage, plastics, carcass and innards of animals, fish and chicken from the slaughterhouses in the area. The true menace of this reservoir of sickness, death and pollution is largely invisible. It's the citizens that pay the highest price for government apathy, corruption and inaction. After the recent state elections, Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) now governs Delhi. Having accused previous governments of \"criminal negligence\" of Delhi's waste issues, the party now has a monumental task on its hands."

Edvard Smith was known to Ms Smith and there had been no prior contact between the police and the victim or suspect. 'So much commotion' Following the shooting, the landlady of The Three Horseshoes, Michelle Thomas, told Sky News she heard two loud bangs that she initially \"thought were fireworks\" on the night of the attack. She said there was \"so much commotion - screaming, shouting, crying\" and the shooting had left the community in \"absolute shock\".  She said Ms Smith, from Slough, had been to the pub before, \"mostly in the summer\" but \"wasn't a regular\".

        "Content": "\n          Health correspondent\n              @ashishskynews\n  Mark Hammersley is a survivor. Standing in the Welsh sun, smiling broadly with an outreaching hand to welcome me, he looks the picture of good health.  There is no sign of the trauma. Or the desperate battle for life he fought and won. I first met Mark as he gasped for air in Warrington Hospital's intensive care unit. It was October 2020 and the country was in the grip of the second wave of the COVID pandemic. \"The first 24 hours was critical. I was unconscious really in many ways,\" Mark reminds me. He doesn't need to. The image of Mark wearing a breathing mask attached by a tube to a CPAP machine will stay with me for a very long time. He had been admitted after becoming poorly while moving house. Mark was 57 then and his underlying health conditions put him at serious risk. His raspy voice was barely audible over the constant bleeping of the ICU's life-saving diagnostic machines. \n                  Police Scotland officers may have been COVID pandemic 'super-spreaders', inquiry hears\n                 \n                  Prince William reveals he skipped Paris Olympics due to Kate fears\n                 \n                  Pharmacist who took his own life after COVID jab complications was denied compensation\n                 \"I've got diabetes and I'm overweight so they're my risk factors. So to be honest for me it's still early days,\" he told me at the time. His underlying health issues meant Mark had to shield for most of the year. And until then it had worked. Standing next to his bed I asked Mark if he was concerned about his health, about the possible outcome. \"I'm worried yes,\" he replied. \"But I'm feeling safe if that makes sense.\" Mark tells me now that the doctors treating him were not sure he would make it through the night. They had warned his wife that he was not likely to survive. But instead of inducing Mark into a coma and putting him on life support using a ventilator, the doctors gambled by using a CPAP machine. The Continuous Positive Airway Pressure unit crucially keeps airways from narrowing or collapsing. And that decision, Mark is convinced, ultimately saved his life. He is aware that the outcomes for COVID patients put on ventilators were not good. Five years on and Mark is still feeling the impact of that devastating infection. But he is a relieved man.

When I was in hospital and afterwards I had a lot of muscular pain so for about 18 months I probably couldn't even put a shirt on properly.\" In the ICU bed next to Mark's I also interviewed a young grandmother. She was sat upright and also breathing with the help of a CPAP machine. But she was much more talkative and alert compared to Mark. She was confident her treatment was going well. But when I returned to the hospital a few weeks later to follow up with both patients I was told she had died shortly after filming. Mark was aware. He knows that he will live with the long-term health complications from COVID for the rest of his life. But he's still thankful, every single day for that opportunity. The UK will mark the five-year anniversary of the start of the COVID pandemic on Sunday. The deadly virus shut down the world after it spread from Wuhan in China at the start of 2020. Between March of that year and July 2022, an estimated 180,000 people died after contracting COVID in England and Wales, according to figures published by The King's Fund thinktank. The UK government said Sunday's day of reflection will be an opportunity for the public to remember those who lost their lives, as well as reflect on the impact the virus had on everyday life and pay tribute the frontline workers."

Pearce, 62, had been in Las Vegas to watch a rugby league match between Wigan Warriors and Warrington Wolves when he became unwell on the flight back to London Heathrow on Sunday 2 March. After the former Nottingham Forest defender received treatment on the Virgin Atlantic plane, a decision was made to make an emergency landing at St John's International Airport in Canada. Football commentator Sam Matterface, who works with Pearce at talkSPORT said from the City Ground ahead of Forest's game against Man City on Saturday: \"I spoke to him yesterday, he's in great spirits. \"He isn't 100%, that is definitely the case, but he is in the right place, he is in the hospital.

Mr Farage revealed accusations of bullying by Mr Lowe and accused him of falling out with all his fellow Reform UK MPs, with too many \"outbursts\" using \"inappropriate language\". And he took the highly unusual step of quoting a Labour minister, Mike Kane, who said after a confrontation with Mr Lowe in the Commons that his anger \"showed a man not in charge of his own faculties\". On Friday, party chairman and Farage lieutenant Zia Yusuf and chief whip Lee Anderson MP disclosed accusations that two female workers had complained of \"serious bullying\" in Mr Lowe's offices, and said he had been reported to police over allegations he threatened Mr Yusuf with physical violence. Mr Lowe, who has been suspended by the parliamentary party, denied the claims. The worsening of the feud between the Reform UK leader and the millionaire MP for Great Yarmouth came in articles in The Sunday Telegraph in which they both furiously attacked each other.

And he claimed that at a time when Reform UK's poll ratings were rising the attacks on him by the party would be a turn-off to voters, declaring: \"Infighting failed the Tories - and it's failing Reform.\" Mr Farage also began his Telegraph article by claiming: \"If the last general election taught us anything, it is that the public does not like political parties that engage in constant infighting.\" But he claimed that thanks to Mr Lowe \"unloading a barrage of criticisms against our operations and its main actors\", Reform's unity has been dented. 'Containment strategies invariably fail' Mr Farage said Mr Lowe had \"managed to fall out with all his parliamentary colleagues in one way or another\", adding: \"We did our best to keep a lid on things but, in the end, containment strategies invariably fail.\" He then referred to a Commons clash with Mr Kane just before Christmas, after Mr Lowe staged a debate about a damaged ship containing toxic cargo docked in his Great Yarmouth constituency. \"Mr Lowe was unhappy with the answer that he received from Mr Kane and, at the end of the debate, he crossed the floor to make his feelings known,\" Mr Farage wrote. \"A confrontation ensued. Heated language was heard. The minister's shoulder was pushed. In the end, the Serjeant at Arms had to step in to calm things down between the two parliamentarians. \"Commenting on Mr Lowe's conduct later, Mr Kane (said) 'the anger displayed towards me clearly showed a man not in charge of his own faculties'. Nobody in Reform UK said anything publicly about what had happened. Instead, we carried on. \"Yet the fact is that, sadly, there have been too many similar outbursts from Mr Lowe, often involving the use of inappropriate language, to the despair of our chief whip, Lee Anderson. \"I have been surprised and saddened at this behaviour. Certainly, I never saw anything like it in the European Parliament in 2019 when I was the leader of the Brexit Party and Mr Lowe was an MEP colleague.\" Read more:Lowe invites Farage to dinnerFarage gives up sole control of ReformParty passes 200,000 members On bullying allegations, Mr Farage wrote: \"Last week, the chairman of Reform UK, Zia Yusuf, showed me two letters sent by female members of staff to our party headquarters. Each letter contained an accusation of workplace bullying involving Mr Lowe. \"One of the incidents in question is alleged to have taken place within the parliamentary estate. Both women's letters stated that these allegations had been reported to the parliamentary authorities. \"As a responsible political party, Reform UK has a duty of care to every single member of staff, whether they are employed by us directly or indirectly. \"With that in mind, I believe that our chairman was entirely right for Reform to appoint a KC to conduct an independent inquiry. It is inconceivable that we could simply ignore such allegations.\" 'I will not tolerate these falsehoods' In his Telegraph article, Mr Lowe repeated his claim that there is no credible evidence against him and he was removed from the party before any investigation had started. \"I will not tolerate these falsehoods, and discussions have already taken place with my legal team,\" he wrote. \"Is it a surprise that these allegations were made public the day after I made reasonable criticisms of Nigel Farage and the Reform leadership? \"It is a witch hunt, plain for all to see. I have been entirely frozen out of the Reform machine over the last few months, in a deliberate and calculated way.\" Without naming Mr Farage, deputy leader Richard Tice or Mr Yusuf, he said the Reform UK leadership was unable even to accept the most mild constructive criticism. Turning on Mr Yusuf, he wrote: \"The allegations against me from the chairman relate to an incident in December, but he only reported them to the police the day after my reasonable questioning was published. \"Take from that what you will. I don't feel sorry for myself. I feel sorry for the millions of decent British men and women who put their faith in Reform. They deserve better than this vicious charade.\" 👉 Click here to listen to Electoral Dysfunction on your podcast app 👈 And warning of the damage the feuding was causing, Mr Lowe said: \"Everything has been put at risk. Everything. The future of the Right in Britain is now in peril. How can Reform claim to be a party awaiting government when they can't even follow basic process? \"Reform has been rising in the polls for months. But this spectre of infighting will leave the party looking unserious and turn voters off. Infighting failed the Tories - and it's failing Reform.\" But Mr Lowe concluded with an olive branch. \"On multiple occasions, I have invited Nigel Farage for dinner over the last few months,\" he revealed. \"Every single one has been refused or ignored. \"Again, I offer a public invitation to Nigel. Let's have dinner and resolve this in the matter that our members, supporters and country would expect. Any time, any place.\" He added: \"I want Reform to be professional, to be fair, to be serious. We must offer a credible alternative to the uniparty that has so failed so spectacularly. \"The leadership's behaviour this week has undermined that cause, not only in the eyes of the electorate, but also in those of serious individuals across business and industry that any party of government needs to win over.\""

This was the response of a Ukrainian soldier in a frontline combat regiment directly affected by Donald Trump's decision to pause US military support to Ukraine. Serhii, 45, maintains a unit of US-supplied Bradley infantry fighting vehicles that are defending an area of eastern Ukraine from attacking Russian forces. The halt to American military aid - if sustained - means there will be no new ammunition and no ability to repair any of the vehicles when they are damaged - a constant risk. Ukraine war latest: Follow live updates On a recent mission by the 425th Storming Regiment \"Skala\", three Bradleys went into battle towards the direction of the city of Pokrovsk, an area of heavy clashes. Only two returned after the other was hit by the Russian side. \"It's going to be very hard,\" Serhii said, standing next to a large Bradley, covered by a camouflage net and tucked under a line of trees in the Donetsk region. \"These vehicles are really good. You can fight back with them. And not just defend, you can even advance. It's a shame we didn't have this equipment two or three years ago.\"  The regiment has been using Bradleys for a number of months. Serhii is the lead mechanic. The tracked vehicles, armed with a chain gun that can fire 200 rounds per minute, were first developed in the 1980s but have been fitted with modern reactive armour that means they can survive drone strikes, rocket attacks and the shrapnel from artillery rounds. \"The vehicle's protection… is fantastic,\" Serhii said, with clear admiration for the equipment compared with Soviet-era fighting vehicles that many Ukrainian troops have to use. He said the crew of one of his Bradleys was hit by two rocket-propelled grenades but was able to continue driving and was unharmed. Serhii, who comes from the Donetsk region, said he felt betrayed by Mr Trump's decision to halt such crucial support. The US president ordered the move as he attempts to put pressure on Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to negotiate a ceasefire deal with Russia. \"Although I'm not a politician, it's a betrayal for us, for the guys who are defending Ukraine,\" the soldier said. Asked how he felt when he heard the news about the US president's decision, Serhii said: \"The latest news cuts my heart, I can answer you that way. It cuts my heart... If politicians solve issues this way, just by halting weapons supply in one move, that's criminal.\" He signalled it would be harder for Ukrainian troops to defend their land without the US military support - but they would still fight. \"Even without this weapon, we believe we will move forward,\" he said. \"They [the Russians] have to retreat, no matter what. The guys didn't take up arms here for nothing, and they stand together. Together, all of us, as one, will defeat this enemy.\" As for whether he had a message for Mr Trump, the soldier said: \"Don't stop military aid. Politics is politics, but the people, I believe, are the most important. \"It will be very hard for us without such equipment. This equipment is good; it allows us to show results. And we will keep showing them. We've shown them before and we will keep showing them. That's how it is. Thank you.\" Fighting 'for my motherland' Sky News watched as two crews prepared their fighting vehicles for a potential mission on Thursday evening. Sedoi, 41, commands one of the Bradleys and operates the gun. He said the American-supplied vehicle gives him confidence when he goes into battle - and was also likely a scary prospect for Russian troops to have to encounter. \"We make a lot of noise. Everything catches fire and burns... It's a good vehicle,\" he said.  Sedoi said he did not have a reaction to the news about the halt to American military support, saying: \"I don't get involved in their politics.\" However, he signalled he did want an end to the war - even if it meant Russia keeping some of the land it has seized. \"Let it end, so people stop dying.

        "Content": "Under-performing civil servants could be encouraged to leave their jobs and senior officials will have their pay linked to performance, in a new government bid to \"fundamentally reshape\" the civil service. Cabinet Office minister Pat McFadden, who is appearing on Sunday Morning with Trevor Phillips, said \"the state is not match-fit to rise to the moment our country faces\". The plans have been criticised by a union, however, who described them as a \"retreading of failed narratives\". The general secretary of the FDA, a union for civil servants, accused the government of delivering a \"soundbite, not a credible plan for change\". \"If the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster wants civil servants to focus on delivery, while at the same time government departments are cutting resources, then ministers need to set realistic priorities,” said Dave Penman. \"Government should get on with the difficult job of setting those priorities rather than announcing a new performance management process for civil servants every other month.\" Next week, Mr McFadden will promise a new \"mutually agreed exits\" process, in which civil servants who cannot perform at the level required of them are incentivised to leave their jobs. \n                  Nigel Farage and Rupert Lowe escalate feud with new war of words\n                 \n                  Rupert Lowe: Reform UK MP reported to police for alleged bullying\n                 \n                  Man holding Palestinian flag who climbed up Elizabeth Tower comes down\n                 Read more from Sky News:Five years on from COVID, one survivor reflects on fighting for his lifeWould the world be more peaceful if more women were in charge?'Common error' could leave thousands of women out of pocket The system will give bosses more tools to address bad performance. Alongside the exit processes, senior civil servants who are not meeting standards will be put on development plans. If there’s no improvement within six months, they will be sacked. Most senior officials will also now have their pay linked to performance outcomes. Mr McFadden will also pledge to increase the government's digital capabilities, with more staff to be employed in relevant roles, and more public services to be digitised."

Anthony Albanese said the impacts of ex-Tropical Cyclone Alfred are already being felt across parts of Queensland and New South Wales, with the hours ahead expected to bring more downpours. \"We must remain vigilant. This is a very serious weather event,\" he said in an update on Saturday morning. \"The impact will be serious and will intensify over coming hours and coming days.

Tropical Cyclone Alfred had been expected to become the first cyclone to cross the east Australian coast near the Queensland state capital since 1974. But the weather event weakened early on Saturday to a tropical low, which is defined as carrying sustained winds of less than 39mph. The cyclone came to a near-standstill off the Brisbane coast for several hours on the first day of the weekend, but it is still forecast to track west across the Australian mainland in the coming days, bringing heavy rain, Matt Collopy, manager at Australia's Bureau of Meteorology, said. Read more: What we know about storm nearing Australian coast Fallen trees across the region have already damaged power lines, homes and cars, while the Gold Coast's renowned beaches have become steep sandy cliffs after days of relentless erosion. A number of flood warnings are in place across the east coast, with the Bureau of Meteorology Australia warning that \"rivers are rising rapidly\" and flash floods also pose a \"huge risk\". The national forecaster said the peak of flooding is expected to be overnight on Saturday into early Sunday. Mr Albanese warned people not to take the weather downgrade as a reason to be complacent, adding that the advice of his government remains: \"If it's flooded, forget it.\" Sarah Ndiaye, the mayor of Byron Shire in New South Wales, told Sky News that the region had \"dodged a bullet\" after the cyclone didn't hit as expected, but it remains a \"very, very tense\" situation. An estimated 19,000 people have been evacuated from low-lying homes. In Queensland, a woman sustained minor injuries when an apartment building lost its roof, officials said. She was one of 21 people who were evacuated from the building. Two other people narrowly escaped a large tree falling on their home in the Currumbin Valley in Queensland on Thursday night. They were lying only inches from where the tree came to rest in their bedroom, they said, adding both suffered minor injuries. Region's 'largest ever loss of power' More than 330,000 homes and businesses lost power on both sides of the border, a large proportion of them on the Gold Coast, which recorded the strongest gusts of 107kph (66 mph) on Friday night. Queensland Premier David Crisafulli said the outage is the \"largest ever loss of power from a natural disaster\" in the region's history. He said authorities and emergency services are \"throwing everything\" at restoring power to those affected and clearing roads that have been blocked by fallen debris.

A severe weather warning is in place for \"heavy to locally intense rainfall\" and \"damaging winds\", covering areas to the south of Gympie in Queensland all the way down to Nambucca Heads in New South Wales. The forecaster said a \"gradual easing\" of the intense rainfall should be seen by Monday night, but this depends on how the system moves across the country."

At times parts of the over-saturated site collapses, crushing people. In September 2017, more than 50 million tonnes of garbage came crashing down burying people and vehicles. Satellite data has revealed that this site is a hotspot for methane emissions - a powerful greenhouse gas that is almost 84 times more potent in warming the atmosphere than carbon dioxide over a 20-year period. Kayrros, an energy and environmental intelligence company, shared satellite data with Sky News that showed methane emissions between November 2021 and May 2024, with an average flow rate of 2.91 tonnes per hour. The monsoon season prevents the company from capturing data during warmer months when emissions are expected to be higher. Considering the observations may be on the lower side, methane released at this constant rate amounts to approximately 25 kilotonnes annually, equivalent to the 20-year warming impact of CO2 emissions from 500,000 cars running simultaneously the whole year round. As waste decomposes, chemical reactions within it causes temperatures to rise. Methane self-ignites at high temperatures, which can easily be reached at landfill sites due to the summer heat combined with highly combustible waste like plastic. Established in 1984, the site was designed to hold up to 20 metres of waste which peaked in 2002. For decades, successive governments promised to reduce this mountain by incinerating the trash safely in a state-of-the-art plant, turning waste into electricity - but many deadlines have passed to flatten and reduce the mountain. Delhi generates over 11,000 tonnes of waste daily. Only a small amount of this is incinerated, producing power, while the rest is dumped on the landfills.

I feel very anxious and my head and limbs hurt.\" A few months ago 45-year-old Ansarul Khan was diagnosed with fourth-stage cancer of the lungs and liver. A father of five, the doctors have given him a few weeks or months to live. \"There is so much sickness here because of this garbage. Sometimes it's difficult to just breathe. It's frightening,\" he says. Giving up on the doctors here, his family are taking him to Mumbai for treatment. Dark streams of fluids from the landfill drain into the earth, contaminating ground and surface water. Running parallel is a canal, its water completely black with a putrid stench. Floating in it is garbage, plastics, carcass and innards of animals, fish and chicken from the slaughterhouses in the area. The true menace of this reservoir of sickness, death and pollution is largely invisible. It's the citizens that pay the highest price for government apathy, corruption and inaction. After the recent state elections, Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) now governs Delhi. Having accused previous governments of \"criminal negligence\" of Delhi's waste issues, the party now has a monumental task on its hands."

        "Content": "Two men have been arrested in India over an alleged gang rape of an Israeli female tourist and a local woman. The victims were stargazing with three male travellers - an American and two Indians - when the attack happened near a popular UNESCO World Heritage site on Thursday night. Three men on a motorbike approached the group and asked them for money in Koppal town in southern Karnataka, according to authorities. An argument followed and the three men pushed the male travellers into a nearby river canal, before the women were sexually assaulted, said police official Ram Arasiddi. The American man and one of the two Indian men survived by swimming to safety but the other Indian man drowned and his body was recovered on Saturday. The Indian woman was the homestay operator for the Israeli. Homestay is a form of hospitality and lodging where visitors share a residence with a local host. The arrested pair are being investigated on suspicion of attempted murder, gang rape and robbery, said Mr Arasiddi. Previous high-profile attacks Attacks on women in India gained global attention last year after a junior doctor was raped and murdered at a hospital in the eastern city of Kolkata, sparking national outrage and protests over a lack of safety for women. In 2022, police recorded 31,516 rape cases, a 20% rise on the year before, according to the National Crime Records Bureau. The real figure is believed to be far higher due to the stigma surrounding sexual violence and victims' lack of faith in police. Rape and sexual violence have been in the spotlight since a student was gang-raped in 2012 on a bus in New Delhi and later died of her injuries. The attack led to huge demonstrations and inspired politicians to bring in fast-track courts dedicated to rape cases and toughen up penalties.

        "Content": "More than 1,000 people have died in clashes in Syria after violence erupted between government supporters and people thought to be loyal to the ousted President Bashar al Assad. The death toll, reported by the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (SOHR), makes the two days of violence some of the deadliest since Syria's conflict began 14 years ago, according to the group. The government said it is responding to attacks from remnants of Assad's forces and blamed \"individual actions\" for the violence. Seven hundred and forty-five civilians were killed, mostly in massacres, as well as 148 pro-Assad fighters and 125 people from security forces, according to the British-based SOHR. No official figures have been released.  SOHR said the violence erupted on Thursday afternoon when pro-Assad militants ambushed Syrian security forces in the Latakia region, a former stronghold of the deposed leader where many of the minority Alawites, who made up his support base, live. On Friday, Sunni Muslim gunmen loyal to the government began revenge killings against members of Assad's minority Alawite sect, according to people in the region. \n                  Syria: 'Nearly 200 killed' in country's worst violence since Assad toppled\n                 \n                  A UK-conducted fatal drone strike confirmed for first time since Starmer became PM\n                 \n                  Russian ships filmed carrying military hardware through the English Channel\n                 \"They forcibly brought people down to the streets, then they lined them up and started shooting them,\" said one resident of Baniyasin on the west coast of Syria. \"They left nobody.

Other residents from Alawite communities told the Associated Press (AP) about gunmen shooting Alawites, the majority of them men, in the streets or at the gates of their homes. Many homes were looted and then set on fire, two residents of Syria's coastal region told the AP from their hideouts. The revenge killings stopped early Saturday, according to SOHR's founder Rami Abdurrahman. \"This was one of the biggest massacres during the Syrian conflict,\" Mr Abdurrahman said about the killings of Alawite civilians. Syria's state news agency said all roads leading to the coastal region have been closed \"to prevent violations and gradually restore stability\". According to SOHR, electricity and drinking water were cut off in large areas around the city of Latakia. An unnamed Defense Ministry official was quoted by the news agency as saying government forces have regained control of much of the areas from Assad loyalists. The bodies of 31 people killed in revenge attacks, including nine children and four women, the day before in the village of Tuwaym were laid to rest in a mass grave, residents said. A funeral was held for four Syrian security force members in the northwestern village of Al-Janoudiya. The previous figure given by SOHR was more than 200 dead."

        "Content": "\n          City editor\n              @MarkKleinmanSky\n The bosses of the Premier League and English Football League (EFL) have held secret talks aimed at reviving an industry-wide deal ahead of the launch of the government’s new football watchdog. Sky News has learnt that Richard Masters, the Premier League chief executive, his EFL counterpart, Trevor Birch, and executives from clubs including Arsenal, Brentford, West Ham, Lincoln City, Norwich City and Preston North End met this week to discuss a wide-ranging football industry agreement. Sources said this weekend that the meeting represented a fresh attempt by the sport's key players to reach a deal on financial redistribution, its annual calendar, resource-sharing and other key issues before the Independent Football Regulator (IFR) is formally established. One said that a deal would send a powerful signal to ministers that English football was able to self-regulate in the best interests of all of its key stakeholders. Key to any agreement between the Premier League and the EFL would be the so-called New Deal, which has been under discussion for years, but which has stalled in the last 12 months. While no formal proposal was ever tabled by the top flight, one detailed plan involved a total of £925m of additional funding being handed by the Premier League to the EFL over a six-year period. The most recent blueprint included provision for an immediate £44m payment to the lower leagues, followed by a further £44m within months. \n                  Money blog: 'Common error' could leave thousands of women out of pocket in their pensions during maternity leave - without realising\n                 \n                  Post Office scandal: Fujitsu agrees to talks about contributing to victims' compensation\n                 \n                  Post Office scandal victim died days before compensation letter arrived - as widow says offer an 'utter disgrace'\n                 This £88m, however, would have been pitched as a loan that would be repayable by the EFL over a period of more than six years. The Premier League had decided to make the vote independent of any conditions attached to wider financial reform of English football, alarming a number of top-flight owners. English football's top flight already hands £1.6bn to the rest of English professional football every three years under an 'evergreen' deal. Since the last detailed New Deal negotiations took place between Premier League clubs, the EFL has struck a more lucrative five-year broadcast deal with Sky Sports, which is part of the same ownership structure as Sky News. One source suggested that meant a future offer from the top flight was unlikely to be as large as the last one mooted in 2023. Further talks are understood to be likely following Monday's meeting, which one insider said had been \"constructive\". Legislation to establish the IFR is progressing through parliament. Sky News revealed earlier this month that Christian Purslow, the former Aston Villa and Liverpool chief executive, and Kick It Out chair Sanjay Bhandari, were two of the three candidates on the shortlist to chair the IFR. The identity of the other is unclear. Clubs from both the Premier League and EFL have argued that the watchdog will impose unnecessary and unsustainable costs on them, and that its creation comes at a time when Sir Keir Starmer's government is trying to shrink the regulatory burden on the private sector in order to stimulate economic growth. Football executives have also complained that national insurance hikes announced in Rachel Reeves's Budget last October will also have a severely detrimental impact on the sport's finances. Clubs argue that they have also been stymied by post-Brexit immigration rules which have imposed restrictions on player trading and development. This weekend, the Premier League and EFL declined to comment."

Mr Farage revealed accusations of bullying by Mr Lowe and accused him of falling out with all his fellow Reform UK MPs, with too many \"outbursts\" using \"inappropriate language\". And he took the highly unusual step of quoting a Labour minister, Mike Kane, who said after a confrontation with Mr Lowe in the Commons that his anger \"showed a man not in charge of his own faculties\". On Friday, party chairman and Farage lieutenant Zia Yusuf and chief whip Lee Anderson MP disclosed accusations that two female workers had complained of \"serious bullying\" in Mr Lowe's offices, and said he had been reported to police over allegations he threatened Mr Yusuf with physical violence. Mr Lowe, who has been suspended by the parliamentary party, denied the claims. The worsening of the feud between the Reform UK leader and the millionaire MP for Great Yarmouth came in articles in The Sunday Telegraph in which they both furiously attacked each other.

And he claimed that at a time when Reform UK's poll ratings were rising the attacks on him by the party would be a turn-off to voters, declaring: \"Infighting failed the Tories - and it's failing Reform.\" Mr Farage also began his Telegraph article by claiming: \"If the last general election taught us anything, it is that the public does not like political parties that engage in constant infighting.\" But he claimed that thanks to Mr Lowe \"unloading a barrage of criticisms against our operations and its main actors\", Reform's unity has been dented. 'Containment strategies invariably fail' Mr Farage said Mr Lowe had \"managed to fall out with all his parliamentary colleagues in one way or another\", adding: \"We did our best to keep a lid on things but, in the end, containment strategies invariably fail.\" He then referred to a Commons clash with Mr Kane just before Christmas, after Mr Lowe staged a debate about a damaged ship containing toxic cargo docked in his Great Yarmouth constituency. \"Mr Lowe was unhappy with the answer that he received from Mr Kane and, at the end of the debate, he crossed the floor to make his feelings known,\" Mr Farage wrote. \"A confrontation ensued. Heated language was heard. The minister's shoulder was pushed. In the end, the Serjeant at Arms had to step in to calm things down between the two parliamentarians. \"Commenting on Mr Lowe's conduct later, Mr Kane (said) 'the anger displayed towards me clearly showed a man not in charge of his own faculties'. Nobody in Reform UK said anything publicly about what had happened. Instead, we carried on. \"Yet the fact is that, sadly, there have been too many similar outbursts from Mr Lowe, often involving the use of inappropriate language, to the despair of our chief whip, Lee Anderson. \"I have been surprised and saddened at this behaviour. Certainly, I never saw anything like it in the European Parliament in 2019 when I was the leader of the Brexit Party and Mr Lowe was an MEP colleague.\" Read more:Lowe invites Farage to dinnerFarage gives up sole control of ReformParty passes 200,000 members On bullying allegations, Mr Farage wrote: \"Last week, the chairman of Reform UK, Zia Yusuf, showed me two letters sent by female members of staff to our party headquarters. Each letter contained an accusation of workplace bullying involving Mr Lowe. \"One of the incidents in question is alleged to have taken place within the parliamentary estate. Both women's letters stated that these allegations had been reported to the parliamentary authorities. \"As a responsible political party, Reform UK has a duty of care to every single member of staff, whether they are employed by us directly or indirectly. \"With that in mind, I believe that our chairman was entirely right for Reform to appoint a KC to conduct an independent inquiry. It is inconceivable that we could simply ignore such allegations.\" 'I will not tolerate these falsehoods' In his Telegraph article, Mr Lowe repeated his claim that there is no credible evidence against him and he was removed from the party before any investigation had started. \"I will not tolerate these falsehoods, and discussions have already taken place with my legal team,\" he wrote. \"Is it a surprise that these allegations were made public the day after I made reasonable criticisms of Nigel Farage and the Reform leadership? \"It is a witch hunt, plain for all to see. I have been entirely frozen out of the Reform machine over the last few months, in a deliberate and calculated way.\" Without naming Mr Farage, deputy leader Richard Tice or Mr Yusuf, he said the Reform UK leadership was unable even to accept the most mild constructive criticism. Turning on Mr Yusuf, he wrote: \"The allegations against me from the chairman relate to an incident in December, but he only reported them to the police the day after my reasonable questioning was published. \"Take from that what you will. I don't feel sorry for myself. I feel sorry for the millions of decent British men and women who put their faith in Reform. They deserve better than this vicious charade.\" 👉 Click here to listen to Electoral Dysfunction on your podcast app 👈 And warning of the damage the feuding was causing, Mr Lowe said: \"Everything has been put at risk. Everything. The future of the Right in Britain is now in peril. How can Reform claim to be a party awaiting government when they can't even follow basic process? \"Reform has been rising in the polls for months. But this spectre of infighting will leave the party looking unserious and turn voters off. Infighting failed the Tories - and it's failing Reform.\" But Mr Lowe concluded with an olive branch. \"On multiple occasions, I have invited Nigel Farage for dinner over the last few months,\" he revealed. \"Every single one has been refused or ignored. \"Again, I offer a public invitation to Nigel. Let's have dinner and resolve this in the matter that our members, supporters and country would expect. Any time, any place.\" He added: \"I want Reform to be professional, to be fair, to be serious. We must offer a credible alternative to the uniparty that has so failed so spectacularly. \"The leadership's behaviour this week has undermined that cause, not only in the eyes of the electorate, but also in those of serious individuals across business and industry that any party of government needs to win over.\""

Cabinet Office minister Pat McFadden, who is appearing on Sunday Morning with Trevor Phillips, said \"the state is not match-fit to rise to the moment our country faces\". The plans have been criticised by a union, however, who described them as a \"retreading of failed narratives\". The general secretary of the FDA, a union for civil servants, accused the government of delivering a \"soundbite, not a credible plan for change\". \"If the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster wants civil servants to focus on delivery, while at the same time government departments are cutting resources, then ministers need to set realistic priorities,” said Dave Penman. \"Government should get on with the difficult job of setting those priorities rather than announcing a new performance management process for civil servants every other month.\" Next week, Mr McFadden will promise a new \"mutually agreed exits\" process, in which civil servants who cannot perform at the level required of them are incentivised to leave their jobs. \n                  Nigel Farage and Rupert Lowe escalate feud with new war of words\n                 \n                  Rupert Lowe: Reform UK MP reported to police for alleged bullying\n                 \n                  Man holding Palestinian flag who climbed up Elizabeth Tower comes down\n                 Read more from Sky News:Five years on from COVID, one survivor reflects on fighting for his lifeWould the world be more peaceful if more women were in charge?'Common error' could leave thousands of women out of pocket The system will give bosses more tools to address bad performance.

Anthony Albanese said the impacts of ex-Tropical Cyclone Alfred are already being felt across parts of Queensland and New South Wales, with the hours ahead expected to bring more downpours. \"We must remain vigilant. This is a very serious weather event,\" he said in an update on Saturday morning. \"The impact will be serious and will intensify over coming hours and coming days. [It will] still bring strong winds, heavy rain, flooding and dangerous conditions over this weekend and the days beyond. \"Now is the time to remain alert, stay inside and look after each other.\" Police confirmed that a 61-year-old man who disappeared in a flooded river near the town of Dorrigo in New South Wales had died after his body was recovered on Saturday.  Tropical Cyclone Alfred had been expected to become the first cyclone to cross the east Australian coast near the Queensland state capital since 1974. But the weather event weakened early on Saturday to a tropical low, which is defined as carrying sustained winds of less than 39mph. The cyclone came to a near-standstill off the Brisbane coast for several hours on the first day of the weekend, but it is still forecast to track west across the Australian mainland in the coming days, bringing heavy rain, Matt Collopy, manager at Australia's Bureau of Meteorology, said.

A number of flood warnings are in place across the east coast, with the Bureau of Meteorology Australia warning that \"rivers are rising rapidly\" and flash floods also pose a \"huge risk\". The national forecaster said the peak of flooding is expected to be overnight on Saturday into early Sunday. Mr Albanese warned people not to take the weather downgrade as a reason to be complacent, adding that the advice of his government remains: \"If it's flooded, forget it.\" Sarah Ndiaye, the mayor of Byron Shire in New South Wales, told Sky News that the region had \"dodged a bullet\" after the cyclone didn't hit as expected, but it remains a \"very, very tense\" situation. An estimated 19,000 people have been evacuated from low-lying homes. In Queensland, a woman sustained minor injuries when an apartment building lost its roof, officials said. She was one of 21 people who were evacuated from the building. Two other people narrowly escaped a large tree falling on their home in the Currumbin Valley in Queensland on Thursday night. They were lying only inches from where the tree came to rest in their bedroom, they said, adding both suffered minor injuries. Region's 'largest ever loss of power' More than 330,000 homes and businesses lost power on both sides of the border, a large proportion of them on the Gold Coast, which recorded the strongest gusts of 107kph (66 mph) on Friday night. Queensland Premier David Crisafulli said the outage is the \"largest ever loss of power from a natural disaster\" in the region's history. He said authorities and emergency services are \"throwing everything\" at restoring power to those affected and clearing roads that have been blocked by fallen debris.

A severe weather warning is in place for \"heavy to locally intense rainfall\" and \"damaging winds\", covering areas to the south of Gympie in Queensland all the way down to Nambucca Heads in New South Wales. The forecaster said a \"gradual easing\" of the intense rainfall should be seen by Monday night, but this depends on how the system moves across the country."

The poison enters their bodies through the air weakening their immunity and medicines are not as effective as they should be,\" Dr Arshad Khan says.  He has been practicing for 14 years at the Mulla Colony, which is adjacent to the Ghazipur landfill. One of the largest landfills in the country, it is also called the \"garbage mountain of Delhi\". A monstrosity, an eyesore - but more than that a source of death, decay, disease and pollution for hundreds of thousands who live and work in its shadows. This trash mount is more than 200 feet high and covers an area of almost 70 acres - over 50 football pitches. Standing at the top of more than 14 million metric tonnes of waste, one gets the size and scale of this man-made disaster. Its stench is nauseating, breathing is difficult and a toxic taste engulfs the mouth and throat. \n                  Arvind Kejriwal detained: Protesters demand release of rival to Indian leader Narendra Modi\n                 \n                  Arvind Kejriwal detained: India's PM Narendra Modi criticised as protests held over political rival's arrest\n                 \n                  Man arrested after 16-year-old girl stabbed to death on Delhi street - as passers-by watched on\n                 Feasted upon by birds, flies, vermin and cattle, this 20-storey slope of waste often catches fire in toxic blazes that last for days, especially during the summer. At times parts of the over-saturated site collapses, crushing people. In September 2017, more than 50 million tonnes of garbage came crashing down burying people and vehicles. Satellite data has revealed that this site is a hotspot for methane emissions - a powerful greenhouse gas that is almost 84 times more potent in warming the atmosphere than carbon dioxide over a 20-year period. Kayrros, an energy and environmental intelligence company, shared satellite data with Sky News that showed methane emissions between November 2021 and May 2024, with an average flow rate of 2.91 tonnes per hour. The monsoon season prevents the company from capturing data during warmer months when emissions are expected to be higher. Considering the observations may be on the lower side, methane released at this constant rate amounts to approximately 25 kilotonnes annually, equivalent to the 20-year warming impact of CO2 emissions from 500,000 cars running simultaneously the whole year round. As waste decomposes, chemical reactions within it causes temperatures to rise. Methane self-ignites at high temperatures, which can easily be reached at landfill sites due to the summer heat combined with highly combustible waste like plastic. Established in 1984, the site was designed to hold up to 20 metres of waste which peaked in 2002. For decades, successive governments promised to reduce this mountain by incinerating the trash safely in a state-of-the-art plant, turning waste into electricity - but many deadlines have passed to flatten and reduce the mountain. Delhi generates over 11,000 tonnes of waste daily. Only a small amount of this is incinerated, producing power, while the rest is dumped on the landfills.

It's frightening,\" he says. Giving up on the doctors here, his family are taking him to Mumbai for treatment. Dark streams of fluids from the landfill drain into the earth, contaminating ground and surface water. Running parallel is a canal, its water completely black with a putrid stench. Floating in it is garbage, plastics, carcass and innards of animals, fish and chicken from the slaughterhouses in the area. The true menace of this reservoir of sickness, death and pollution is largely invisible. It's the citizens that pay the highest price for government apathy, corruption and inaction. After the recent state elections, Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) now governs Delhi. Having accused previous governments of \"criminal negligence\" of Delhi's waste issues, the party now has a monumental task on its hands."

        "Content": "By Victoria Seabrook, news reporter  If the world has felt more dangerous lately, you're not mistaken. The number of conflicts has been rising. And from Ukraine and Russia, to Israel and Gaza, and Sudan - a common thread running through all these wars is they are waged by men. Meanwhile, in other parts of the world we have seen powerful men wielding chainsaws for fun. Just 13 out of 193 countries have female leaders, according to October 2024 data. If there were more, things would be wildly different, say the likes of former US president Barack Obama. There would be \"less war, kids would be better taken care of and there would be a general improvement in living standards and outcomes\", he said previously. He's not alone. Former Irish president Mary Robinson told Sky News ahead of International Women's Day that having more women at the top was \"necessary\" for a more peaceful world. And on this day 19 years ago, former United Nations chief Kofi Annan said: \"No policy is more important in preventing conflict\" than empowering women. A woman has still never done his job, in 80 years of the UN. Are they right? The answer is more than just the women at the top would have to change. Afraid to appear soft A glance through history suggests women leaders have been just as, if not more, \"prone to initiating conflicts\" as men, according to Christopher Blair, assistant professor of politics at Princeton University. They are incentivised to act as \"Iron Ladies\" specifically to overcome gender stereotypes that cast them as dovish and \"less competent\" on national security, he says. Just look at Margaret Thatcher: in 1982, Britain's first female prime minister plunged 323 people to their deaths on Argentina's Belgrano warship, and led the UK through the Falklands War. Or the famously hawkish US secretary of state Hillary Clinton, who hesitated over peace talks with the Taliban \"because she was afraid of being perceived as stereotypically soft\", says Blair, based on insight from her advisers. In what is nowadays a \"much more hypermasculine world\", according to author Joslyn Barnhart, women are under pressure to \"lean even more into masculine stereotypes of leadership\". Giorgia Meloni, Italy's darling of the right and first woman leader, chose to take the masculine form of her title, il Presidente. Women are also penalised more harshly for backing down from threats, Blair's research finds, encouraging them to add fuel to the fire, not put it out. In 2016, The Sun newspaper hailed Theresa May as resembling \"Maggie at her best\". Two years later, it hammered her for being \"soft\" on Brexit, leaving the country \"IN THE BREXS*IT\". People are different, so it depends on the woman - or man Angela Saini, author of Patriarchs: How Men Came to Rule, says it is not that women imitate male aggression, but rather that they are capable of being aggressive themselves. In 1975, India's prime minister Indira Gandhi declared a state emergency and crackdown on opponents, civil rights and the press. The warrior queen Rani of Jhansi led the Indian rebellion against the British in 1857, and before her, there were Boudica and Joan of Arc. So when asked if women could make the world more peaceful, Saini says: \"Which women do you mean?\" She adds: \"Because frankly, if it's a choice of a world run by women like Thatcher and Liz Truss or, looking to the US, Marjorie Taylor Greene and Sarah Palin - that is not the kind of world that I would want to live in.\" So much would have to change to answer the question The world has had so few women leaders that it makes it hard to truly compare them with men (although one paper found that queens in Europe in the 15th to 20th centuries were more likely to go to war than kings). But just one in three UN countries has ever had one woman in the top position. Society would have to change so radically \"in order to bring us to a world in which women are in charge, that it feels impossible to extrapolate from what we know today to that hypothetical situation\", says psychologist Cordelia Fine, who wrote Patriarch Inc. Not just about the leader But what we do know is giving women other forms of power does make societies more peaceful. \"Women's leadership is not just about women being 'in charge',\" says Ms Robinson, now a member of The Elders, which is campaigning for a female head of the UN. Studies show that involving more women in peace processes makes them last longer; in parliament leads to lower defence spending and in elections makes democracies more peaceful. And it is these types of societies that make way for different kinds of leaders. In New Zealand - ranked fourth highest globally for gender equality - recent prime minister Jacinda Ardern attempted \"a very different model of leadership\" to aggressive counterparts, says Joslyn Barnhart, who researches women's suffrage. \"Of course, we see things going very much in the opposite direction at the moment, much more towards a return to masculine, aggressive, assertive voices,\" she says. Various surveys from different countries have found women are more averse to war (whether this is nature or nurture is another debate) - though that balances out when the threat is imminent. Ms Robinson says it is not that women are better than men. It is that \"solving the world's toughest challenges needs all voices, not just those of half the global population\"."

        "Content": "\n          Arts and entertainment correspondent\n       A drill rapper turned TikTok wildlife presenter hopes to \"bridge the gap\" between young people and climate change. Growing up in Ladbroke Grove, west London, former music star TY was stabbed four times. He had fallen \"into nonsense\", he says, but he always wanted something different for his life. Wildlife and the environment are his real passions. Nowadays, you are more likely to see TY with a boa constrictor clamping on to his arm in the Amazon, or letting a tarantula crawl across his hands. He tells Sky News he wants to help people \"understand the severity of the planet right now\", but the route to his new calling hasn't exactly been a straightforward path. \"I never had purpose,\" the rapper explains. \"Three or four years ago, I would not have seen myself in this light... As I fell into wildlife, I found myself again.\" Collaborations with US wildlife enthusiast Garrett Galvin - aka fishingarrett, one of the biggest wildlife content creators in the world - have certainly helped when it comes to amassing a growing following on social media as TYfromtheWyld. But TY already had a substantial number of fans from his days as a platinum-selling drill rapper, having found fame as a member of the pioneering rap collective CGM (formerly known as 1011). Alongside rapper Digga D, he made headlines when police caught the pair and three others in possession of machetes and baseball bats in 2017. They ended up being given one of the UK's very first music criminal behaviour orders, with the police arguing their songs incited violence - a move which triggered a debate about art censorship. 'I never saw anyone that looked and thought like me' \"It's a rough area, Ladbroke Grove, where I'm from,\" says TY. \"Crime started happening, I started getting into nonsense on the roads and as a young kid growing up you can get easily influenced by some stuff, so I kind of was lost for a while. \"Music was never my passion, I just fell into it. I grew up watching [TV naturalists and conservationists] Steve Backshall, Steve Irwin, but that world was so distant for me. I never saw anyone that looked and thought like me. \"Now I want to represent and be an inspiration for young people.\" Rapper AJ Tracey, who grew up in the same area of London as TY, says people need to understand that it's all too easy to drift down the wrong path. \"What a lot of people don't realise is that people aren't choosing to be in the situation that they are... anyone who wants to change their life and do something positive 100% deserves a second chance, honestly, probably even a third or fourth chance, because we're all humans and we make mistakes.\" Just don't expect Tracey to be making an appearance in any of TY's videos anytime soon. \"He's with some dangerous animals,\" he laughs. \"I don't know about that, I'm scared!\" On a more serious note, Tracey says successive British governments could learn from TY's skills at engaging with young people. \"I feel like when the country's making budget cuts, it's the youth that miss out all the time... the people in power have got to really pull some things together.\" While there might not seem an obvious crossover between drill music and learning about the ecosystem, TY's success clearly demonstrates that an audience is there. \"We're not doing enough to help,\" he says. \"This is my mission, to save animals, save the world, and get as many people on board as I can. \"Maybe a guy like me, from a certain background, will just kick a lot of people up to just say, 'Yo. He's doing something'.\""
