        "Content": "\n          Health correspondent\n              @ashishskynews\n A leading British palliative care consultant has described the assisted dying bill as \"not fit for purpose\" and is urging MPs to stop the bill from progressing any further. Rejecting assurances from supporters of assisted dying who claim the proposed British version would be based on the scheme used in the American state of Oregon - widely regarded as the model with the most safeguards - Dr Amy Proffitt said \"it's far from a safe system\". \"The majority, 80% of the people that have assisted death have government insurance with Medicaid or Medicare suggesting that the vulnerable in society are not worth it,\" she said. \"Put that into our NHS and what does it say about us as a society... those with disability, those with learning disabilities, those with social deprivation?\" Dr Proffitt added: \"I think it's deeply dangerous for the bill that has been proposed and it needs to be scrapped and we go back and look again.\" She and other leading palliative care doctors have expressed concern about the erosion of end of life care if the bill passes. It is a fear expressed by Britain's hospice sector. Read more:Why is assisted dying so controversial - and where is it already legal? Dr Ted Gruber, a retired Oregon doctor who has assisted numerous assisted deaths, says those fears have not been realised and the state's hospice sector has strengthened since the introduction of assisted dying in Oregon in 1994. He says he has never had any doubts about his role as a physician who assists a patient's death. \"I've never been conflicted,\" he explains. \"I've attended a number of them. \"Each of the ones I've attended has been almost sacred if you will, it's hard to explain but with the family there, the family dog in the bed, with the music playing that they want. \"Everyone's sad, everyone's crying, it's not a joyful moment but in a way it's kind of a sacred moment.\" Oregon's assisted dying laws have not seen the same number of changes to widen the cohort groups who would qualify for an assisted death in the way, for example, Canada has. So it has managed to steer clear of the \"slippery slope\" criticism levelled at other programmes. Dr Gruber also said the assisted death scheme in Oregon had enhanced the patient-physician relationship. \"The role of the doctor who is attending the dying patient is one of listening and paying attention to what the needs of the dying patient are and it's eroded when the patient can't trust the doctor,\" he said. \"When I've seen a patient who has tried to talk to a doctor about aid in dying and they're like 'oh, I won't do that, I'm opposed to it'... well that doesn't enhance a doctor-patient relationship, it will be enhanced when a doctor says let's talk about why you want to ask that.\" Read more from Sky News:Assisted dying law 'unworkable, unaffordable and naive'MPs criticise Esther Rantzen's assisted dying intervention Oregon's assisted death model is the closest to what is being proposed in the UK. Both require it to apply only to adults who are terminally ill, mentally competent, and have six months to live or less, and to take the drugs themselves. But while Oregon cases are reviewed by two doctors, in the UK they would be reviewed by a panel including a psychiatrist, a social worker and a legal professional. In Oregon, the drugs are posted to the individual for them to take when ready, whereas in the UK, a healthcare professional would bring them on the day of the planned death. Marcy Lehman's father Ted was \"her hero, the person I looked up to'. An Oregon doctor, he chose to have an assisted death at home in Portland surrounded by his family. Marcy was there by his side. And it was for her, her mother and ultimately her father, the right decision. \"This was my hero, the person I looked up to, and now the roles were switched and I was taking care of him, and I had to be his hero,\" Marcy said. She explained that his stomach cancer \"was starting to work up his system so he couldn't eat.\" \"My dad was a strong person and stronger even up until his death,\" Marcy added. \"He didn't want someone to have to go to the bathroom with him to help with that or to feed him that wasn't what he wanted - yeah, he was in pain, he could endure the pain, but it was really more the dignified way he wanted to leave this Earth.\" Ted's family are grateful that they live in a state where assisted death is allowed. It's a choice they would make again if they had to. Now the UK must soon decide if that same choice is made available over here. The Terminally Ill Adults (End Of Life) Bill was introduced to the House of Commons last October. Later this month, MPs will be asked to vote again in a ballot that will decide the fate of the proposed legislation."

        "Content": "\n          Security and Defence Editor\n              @haynesdeborah\n The UK will buy up to 7,000 long-range missiles, rockets and drones and build at least six weapons factories in a £1.5bn push to rearm at a time of growing threats. The plan, announced by the government over the weekend, will form part of Sir Keir Starmer's long-awaited Strategic Defence Review, which will be published on Monday. However, it lacks key details, including when the first arms plant will be built, when the first missile will be made, or even what kind of missiles, drones and rockets will be purchased. The government is yet to appoint a new senior leader to take on the job of \"national armaments director\", who will oversee the whole effort. Andy Start, the incumbent head of Defence Equipment and Support - the branch of defence charged with buying kit - is still doing the beefed-up role of national armaments director as a sluggish process to recruit someone externally rumbles on. Revealing some of its content ahead of time, the Ministry of Defence said the defence review will recommend an \"always on\" production capacity for munitions, drawing on lessons learned from Ukraine, which has demonstrated the vital importance of large production lines. It will also call for an increase in stockpiles of munitions - something that is vitally needed for the army, Royal Navy and Royal Air Force to be able to keep fighting beyond a few days. Sky News will launch a new podcast series on 10 June based around a wargame that simulates an attack by Russia against the UK to test Britain's defences \"The hard-fought lessons from [Vladimir] Putin's illegal invasion of Ukraine show a military is only as strong as the industry that stands behind them,\" John Healey, the defence secretary, said in a statement released on Saturday night. \"We are strengthening the UK's industrial base to better deter our adversaries and make the UK secure at home and strong abroad.\" The UK used to have a far more resilient defence industry during the Cold War, with the capacity to manufacture missiles and other weapons and ammunition at speed and at scale. However, much of that depth, which costs money to sustain, was lost following the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, when successive governments switched funding priorities away from defence and into areas such as health, welfare and economic growth. Even after Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022 and a huge increase in demand from Kyiv for munitions from its allies, production lines at UK factories were slow to expand. Sky News visited a plant run by the defence company Thales in Belfast last year that makes N-LAW anti-tank missiles used in Ukraine. Its staff at the time only worked weekday shifts between 7am and 4pm. Under this new initiative, the government said the UK will build at least six new \"munitions and energetics\" factories. Energetic materials include explosives, propellants and pyrotechnics, which are required in the manufacturing of weapons. There were no details, however, on whether these will be national factories or built in partnership with defence companies, or a timeline for this to happen. There was also no information on where they would be located or what kind of weapons they would make. In addition, it was announced that the UK will buy \"up to 7,000 UK-built long-range weapons for the UK Armed Forces\", though again without specifying what. It is understood these weapons will include a mix of missiles, rockets and drones. Sources within the defence industry criticised the lack of detail, which is so often the case with announcements by the Ministry of Defence. The sources said small and medium-sized companies in particular are struggling to survive as they await clarity from the Ministry of Defence over a range of different contracts. One source described a sense of \"paralysis\". The prime minister launched the defence review last July, almost a year ago. But there had been a sense of drift within the Ministry of Defence beforehand, in the run-up to last year's general election. The source said: \"While the government's intentions are laudable, the lack of detail in this announcement is indicative of how we treat defence in this country. \"Headline figures, unmatched by clear intent and delivery timelines which ultimately leave industry no closer to knowing what, or when, the MOD want their bombs and bullets. \"After nearly 18 months of decision and spending paralysis, what we need now is a clear demand signal from the Ministry of Defence that allows industry to start scaling production, not grand gestures with nothing to back it up.\" As well as rearming the nation, the government said the £1.5bn investment in new factories and weapons would create around 1,800 jobs across the UK."

        "Content": " Israel has confirmed its forces have killed Hamas's Gaza chief, Mohammad Sinwar, as US Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff called the group's counter-offer on a ceasefire \"totally unacceptable\". Mohammad Sinwar became the leader of the militant group in the Gaza Strip after his older brother Yahya Sinwar was killed last October. In a statement, the Israeli military said it had killed Sinwar on 13 May, and was the target of a strike on a hospital in southern Gaza. Hamas has neither confirmed nor denied his death, but Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told parliament on Wednesday that he had been \"eliminated\". Middle East correspondent Mohammed Sinwar was the younger brother of Yahyah Sinwar, the former leader of Hamas and mastermind behind the 7 October attacks, who was killed by IDF forces in Rafah last October. In January of this year, Mohammed was confirmed as the new leader of Hamas in Gaza, following the death of his brother. Among Palestinians, he never had the reputation of Yahya, but he was widely believed to have played a significant role in the kidnap and holding of IDF soldier Gilad Shalit in 2006 and demanded the release of Yahya Sinwar from Israeli prison as part of a swap deal. Born in Khan Younis, Mohammed Sinwar rose through the ranks of Hamas to become a senior commander in Al Qassam Brigades, the group's military wing. He was known as 'The Shadow', in part because of the junior role he played to his older brother and also because few images of him exist. He survived multiple assassination attempts and was previously incorrectly declared dead during Israel's war in Gaza. Sinwar had a reputation for being stubborn, and Israeli sources in the ceasefire negotiations blamed him for slowing the process and changing his demands at the last minute. The IDF has confirmed he was with the commander of the Rafah brigade, Mohammed Shabanah, in tunnels underneath the European Hospital in Gaza when the IDF struck in mid-May. Shabanah's death is significant because he was a likely successor to Sinwar.  It would leave Azadi al-Hadad, the Gaza City Brigade Commander, as the only living Hamas commander from 7 October.  He would likely be in line as the next Hamas chief in Gaza. Hamas seeks changes in US ceasefire proposal It comes as Hamas said it was seeking amendments to a US-proposed ceasefire deal, offering 10 living Israeli hostages and the bodies of 18 in exchange for Palestinian prisoners. On Thursday, the White House said Israel agreed to a 60-day ceasefire proposal, which would see the release of nine living hostages and half of the known hostages who have died over the course of a week. \n                  Last hospital in northern Gaza out of service after evacuation\n                 \n                  UK will 'seek to do more if it can' for Gaza's injured children, foreign secretary David Lammy says\n                 \n                  'What did they do to be burned and bombed?': Charity calls on UK to offer Gaza children life-saving treatment\n                 Israel and Hamas would then continue talks to bring the remaining hostages home, but Israel would retain the right to resume military action in Gaza if talks were to break down. In a statement about the proposal on Saturday, Hamas said its response \"aims to achieve a permanent ceasefire, a complete withdrawal from the Gaza Strip, and to ensure the flow of humanitarian aid to our people in the Strip\".  Hamas offer 'totally unacceptable' - Witkoff Donald Trump's special Middle East envoy, Mr Witkoff, said on social media that Hamas's response is \"totally unacceptable and only takes us backwards\". \"Hamas should accept the framework proposal we put forward as the basis for proximity talks, which we can begin immediately this coming week,\" he added. Senior Hamas official Basem Naim told Reuters that the group has not rejected the proposal but added Mr Witkoff's response was \"unfair\" and showed \"complete bias\" towards Israel. Israel has not yet responded to Hamas' counter-offer, but has previously rejected the conditions and demanded the complete disarmament and dismantling of the group. 👉 Listen to Sky News Daily on your podcast app 👈 Meanwhile, Gaza aid groups have said dozens of World Food Programme (WFP) trucks carrying flour to Gaza bakeries had been hijacked by armed groups and subsequently looted by people.

        "Content": "\n          News correspondent\n              @AlicePorterTV\n Forty hectares of greenhouses, heated by the burning of rubbish, are set to be built in Essex - making it the largest low-carbon horticulture site in Europe. These greenhouses will be the first of their kind and could provide around 6% of the tomatoes consumed in the UK. It should begin operating in 2027, when almost all the county's household rubbish will come to the Rivenhall site, where it will then be burnt in an incinerator. Gareth Jones works for waste company Indaver, which is building the facility. He said: \"The boiler produces steam and some of that steam we'll divert to our new heat exchange, and that will produce the hot water that we'll be sending over to our greenhouses. \"The rest of the steam goes to the turbine, so it produces electricity from the substation, and some of the electricity will go directly to the greenhouses.\" Currently, Essex's household waste goes to landfill where it gives off greenhouse gasses, particularly methane. \n                  Nigeria floods: At least 110 dead as heavy flooding submerges thousands of houses\n                 \n                  More than 40% of Europe slides into drought, including pockets of Greece, southern Italy and Spain\n                 \n                  Four Just Stop Oil activists jailed for plotting to disrupt Manchester Airport\n                 Indaver claims that the CO2 emitted at the Rivenhall site is 20% less than if the rubbish had gone to landfill, and there are additional environmental benefits. According to Defra, almost half of the UK's fresh vegetables are imported. Tomatoes often come from Morocco, Spain and the Netherlands. But there is growing concern about the vast number of plastic polytunnels in the south of Spain. Almeria's 'Sea of Greenhouses' are even visible from space, and there are regular droughts in the area. Trucks then bring the produce all the way to the UK, releasing thousands of tonnes of CO2 en route. Rivenhall Greenhouse project director Ed Moorhouse says the UK's reliance on importing fruit and veg is not sustainable. \"Water porosity in north Africa and in southern Spain is a key issue, extremes of temperature and the effects of climate change,\" he said. \"What we're seeking to do is, if it was tomatoes, to reshore 6-8% of tomato imports by growing in Essex.\" But the National Farmers Union says further projects like Rivenhall could be hampered by the government's new biodiversity net gain strategy, which forces all developers to benefit nature through their builds. Martin Emmett, chair of the NFU's Horticulture and Potatoes Board, says the policy was \"originally designed around housing estates, larger factories and commercial developments\".

Consequently, companies may have to buy extra land to offset biodiversity impacts, which would affect similar investments across the country. A Defra spokesperson said: \"We are working closely with the sector to make Biodiversity Net Gain work more effectively, whilst investing £5 billion into farming, the largest ever budget for sustainable food production to bolster our food security.\""

        "Content": "\n          US correspondent\n              @marthakelner\n  California's best high school athletes are competing this weekend at the State Championships. The stadium in Clovis, a city in the foothills of the Sierra Nevada mountains, is dressed for the occasion. Huge banners welcome athletes from across the state, food stalls line the concourse and teenagers sell event programmes. \"Good luck to all the athletes and their coaches,\" the inside of the programme reads. Many of the athletes have trained for years and, for some, receiving lucrative university scholarships rests on their performance here. But one issue, one competitor, is dominating the chatter. \"Which one is she?\" I hear a group of boys asking. They're talking about AB Hernandez, a 16-year-old transgender girl, who is now the focus of a legal, political and cultural row. She was born a boy but has transitioned and now competes against the girls. \n                  All passengers confirmed dead after California plane crash\n                 \n                  FBI names suspect in California fertility clinic bombing as Guy Edward Bartkus\n                 \n                  Alcatraz: Why does Donald Trump want to reopen the notorious prison - and did anyone ever escape?\n                 Hernandez is favourite to win the long jump and the triple jump and is also competing in the high jump. She led in all three events after preliminary rounds on Friday. Her inclusion in the girls category has become a national conversation. Read more: World Athletics to introduce sex testing As she competes, a plane flies over the stadium trailing a banner, which reads \"No boys in girls' sports.\" It was organised and paid for by two women's advocacy groups. A small protest is also taking place on the road outside. \"Save girls sports,\" one poster reads. \"XX does not equal XY,\" reads another. Aurelia Moore is a local mum and sport fan. \"These kids get up at the crack of dawn,\" she says. \"They work out before school, they go to school, they work out after school, the weekends they work out. And for that just to be taken away so that we can make a boy feel better is just it's wrong. It's very wrong.\" Transgender inclusion is a thorny issue but a vote winner for President Trump, who campaigned with a promise to \"kick out men from women's sport\". He signed an executive order seeking to ban transgender women from female sport. Trump is now threatening to withdraw federal funding from California over Hernandez's participation in this athletics event. In a social media post, he wrote: \"As a Male, he was a less than average competitor. As a Female, this transitioned person is practically unbeatable.\" 'No special advantage' Transgender rights activists attended the event to support Hernandez, cheering her efforts in the high jump. Jessica Schultz is a representative of the party for socialism and liberation, a communist political group. \"All girls deserve to play in girls' sports and trans girls are girls,\" she says. \"So they don't have any extra extreme advantage than somebody who is naturally tall or has naturally wide wingspan like Michael Phelps. \"I'm surprised that the president has time to concern himself with a high school athletic competition,\" she adds, \"but it is not surprising because he has a lot of hateful ideals\". Hernandez has required security at previous events because of abuse against her. A video recently went viral showing her mother being harangued by mums of other student athletes. One of the voices in the video is Sonja Shaw, a school board president for Chino Valley, a district of California. \"I said, boys are boys, girls are girls,\" she says. \"And then, I turned to the stands and I'm like, 'is there anybody that's okay with a boy competing against the girls right now?'\" Girls 'can't win' There are hundreds of thousands of high school students playing sport in California, but only a handful of publicised cases of transgender girls playing girls' sport. I ask Sonja if the issue is being overblown? \"Absolutely not because it's growing,\" she says. \"You have girls who should be on that first-place podium. They work their whole life. Their dream is to be a winner and they can't even win, they can't even compete against these boys.\" In response to the backlash about Hernandez's participation, California is now allowing more cisgender girls to compete here. They may also award two winners if Hernandez finishes first. It's a messy and controversial situation and it's not going away."

        "Content": "\n          Security and Defence Editor\n              @haynesdeborah\n The UK will buy up to 7,000 long-range missiles, rockets and drones and build at least six weapons factories in a £1.5bn push to rearm at a time of growing threats. The plan, announced by the government over the weekend, will form part of Sir Keir Starmer's long-awaited Strategic Defence Review, which will be published on Monday. However, it lacks key details, including when the first arms plant will be built, when the first missile will be made, or even what kind of missiles, drones and rockets will be purchased. The government is yet to appoint a new senior leader to take on the job of \"national armaments director\", who will oversee the whole effort. Andy Start, the incumbent head of Defence Equipment and Support - the branch of defence charged with buying kit - is still doing the beefed-up role of national armaments director as a sluggish process to recruit someone externally rumbles on. Revealing some of its content ahead of time, the Ministry of Defence said the defence review will recommend an \"always on\" production capacity for munitions, drawing on lessons learned from Ukraine, which has demonstrated the vital importance of large production lines. It will also call for an increase in stockpiles of munitions - something that is vitally needed for the army, Royal Navy and Royal Air Force to be able to keep fighting beyond a few days. Sky News will launch a new podcast series on 10 June based around a wargame that simulates an attack by Russia against the UK to test Britain's defences \"The hard-fought lessons from [Vladimir] Putin's illegal invasion of Ukraine show a military is only as strong as the industry that stands behind them,\" John Healey, the defence secretary, said in a statement released on Saturday night. \"We are strengthening the UK's industrial base to better deter our adversaries and make the UK secure at home and strong abroad.\" The UK used to have a far more resilient defence industry during the Cold War, with the capacity to manufacture missiles and other weapons and ammunition at speed and at scale. However, much of that depth, which costs money to sustain, was lost following the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, when successive governments switched funding priorities away from defence and into areas such as health, welfare and economic growth. Even after Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022 and a huge increase in demand from Kyiv for munitions from its allies, production lines at UK factories were slow to expand. Sky News visited a plant run by the defence company Thales in Belfast last year that makes N-LAW anti-tank missiles used in Ukraine. Its staff at the time only worked weekday shifts between 7am and 4pm. Under this new initiative, the government said the UK will build at least six new \"munitions and energetics\" factories. Energetic materials include explosives, propellants and pyrotechnics, which are required in the manufacturing of weapons. There were no details, however, on whether these will be national factories or built in partnership with defence companies, or a timeline for this to happen. There was also no information on where they would be located or what kind of weapons they would make. In addition, it was announced that the UK will buy \"up to 7,000 UK-built long-range weapons for the UK Armed Forces\", though again without specifying what. It is understood these weapons will include a mix of missiles, rockets and drones. Sources within the defence industry criticised the lack of detail, which is so often the case with announcements by the Ministry of Defence. The sources said small and medium-sized companies in particular are struggling to survive as they await clarity from the Ministry of Defence over a range of different contracts. One source described a sense of \"paralysis\". The prime minister launched the defence review last July, almost a year ago. But there had been a sense of drift within the Ministry of Defence beforehand, in the run-up to last year's general election. The source said: \"While the government's intentions are laudable, the lack of detail in this announcement is indicative of how we treat defence in this country. \"Headline figures, unmatched by clear intent and delivery timelines which ultimately leave industry no closer to knowing what, or when, the MOD want their bombs and bullets. \"After nearly 18 months of decision and spending paralysis, what we need now is a clear demand signal from the Ministry of Defence that allows industry to start scaling production, not grand gestures with nothing to back it up.\" As well as rearming the nation, the government said the £1.5bn investment in new factories and weapons would create around 1,800 jobs across the UK."

Rejecting assurances from supporters of assisted dying who claim the proposed British version would be based on the scheme used in the American state of Oregon - widely regarded as the model with the most safeguards - Dr Amy Proffitt said \"it's far from a safe system\". \"The majority, 80% of the people that have assisted death have government insurance with Medicaid or Medicare suggesting that the vulnerable in society are not worth it,\" she said. \"Put that into our NHS and what does it say about us as a society... those with disability, those with learning disabilities, those with social deprivation?\" Dr Proffitt added: \"I think it's deeply dangerous for the bill that has been proposed and it needs to be scrapped and we go back and look again.\" She and other leading palliative care doctors have expressed concern about the erosion of end of life care if the bill passes. It is a fear expressed by Britain's hospice sector. Read more:Why is assisted dying so controversial - and where is it already legal? Dr Ted Gruber, a retired Oregon doctor who has assisted numerous assisted deaths, says those fears have not been realised and the state's hospice sector has strengthened since the introduction of assisted dying in Oregon in 1994. He says he has never had any doubts about his role as a physician who assists a patient's death. \"I've never been conflicted,\" he explains. \"I've attended a number of them. \"Each of the ones I've attended has been almost sacred if you will, it's hard to explain but with the family there, the family dog in the bed, with the music playing that they want. \"Everyone's sad, everyone's crying, it's not a joyful moment but in a way it's kind of a sacred moment.\" Oregon's assisted dying laws have not seen the same number of changes to widen the cohort groups who would qualify for an assisted death in the way, for example, Canada has. So it has managed to steer clear of the \"slippery slope\" criticism levelled at other programmes. Dr Gruber also said the assisted death scheme in Oregon had enhanced the patient-physician relationship. \"The role of the doctor who is attending the dying patient is one of listening and paying attention to what the needs of the dying patient are and it's eroded when the patient can't trust the doctor,\" he said. \"When I've seen a patient who has tried to talk to a doctor about aid in dying and they're like 'oh, I won't do that, I'm opposed to it'... well that doesn't enhance a doctor-patient relationship, it will be enhanced when a doctor says let's talk about why you want to ask that.\" Read more from Sky News:Assisted dying law 'unworkable, unaffordable and naive'MPs criticise Esther Rantzen's assisted dying intervention Oregon's assisted death model is the closest to what is being proposed in the UK. Both require it to apply only to adults who are terminally ill, mentally competent, and have six months to live or less, and to take the drugs themselves. But while Oregon cases are reviewed by two doctors, in the UK they would be reviewed by a panel including a psychiatrist, a social worker and a legal professional. In Oregon, the drugs are posted to the individual for them to take when ready, whereas in the UK, a healthcare professional would bring them on the day of the planned death. Marcy Lehman's father Ted was \"her hero, the person I looked up to'. An Oregon doctor, he chose to have an assisted death at home in Portland surrounded by his family. Marcy was there by his side. And it was for her, her mother and ultimately her father, the right decision. \"This was my hero, the person I looked up to, and now the roles were switched and I was taking care of him, and I had to be his hero,\" Marcy said. She explained that his stomach cancer \"was starting to work up his system so he couldn't eat.\" \"My dad was a strong person and stronger even up until his death,\" Marcy added. \"He didn't want someone to have to go to the bathroom with him to help with that or to feed him that wasn't what he wanted - yeah, he was in pain, he could endure the pain, but it was really more the dignified way he wanted to leave this Earth.\" Ted's family are grateful that they live in a state where assisted death is allowed. It's a choice they would make again if they had to. Now the UK must soon decide if that same choice is made available over here. The Terminally Ill Adults (End Of Life) Bill was introduced to the House of Commons last October. Later this month, MPs will be asked to vote again in a ballot that will decide the fate of the proposed legislation."

        "Content": "\n          News correspondent\n              @AlicePorterTV\n Forty hectares of greenhouses, heated by the burning of rubbish, are set to be built in Essex - making it the largest low-carbon horticulture site in Europe. These greenhouses will be the first of their kind and could provide around 6% of the tomatoes consumed in the UK. It should begin operating in 2027, when almost all the county's household rubbish will come to the Rivenhall site, where it will then be burnt in an incinerator. Gareth Jones works for waste company Indaver, which is building the facility. He said: \"The boiler produces steam and some of that steam we'll divert to our new heat exchange, and that will produce the hot water that we'll be sending over to our greenhouses. \"The rest of the steam goes to the turbine, so it produces electricity from the substation, and some of the electricity will go directly to the greenhouses.\" Currently, Essex's household waste goes to landfill where it gives off greenhouse gasses, particularly methane. \n                  Nigeria floods: At least 110 dead as heavy flooding submerges thousands of houses\n                 \n                  More than 40% of Europe slides into drought, including pockets of Greece, southern Italy and Spain\n                 \n                  Four Just Stop Oil activists jailed for plotting to disrupt Manchester Airport\n                 Indaver claims that the CO2 emitted at the Rivenhall site is 20% less than if the rubbish had gone to landfill, and there are additional environmental benefits. According to Defra, almost half of the UK's fresh vegetables are imported. Tomatoes often come from Morocco, Spain and the Netherlands. But there is growing concern about the vast number of plastic polytunnels in the south of Spain. Almeria's 'Sea of Greenhouses' are even visible from space, and there are regular droughts in the area. Trucks then bring the produce all the way to the UK, releasing thousands of tonnes of CO2 en route. Rivenhall Greenhouse project director Ed Moorhouse says the UK's reliance on importing fruit and veg is not sustainable. \"Water porosity in north Africa and in southern Spain is a key issue, extremes of temperature and the effects of climate change,\" he said. \"What we're seeking to do is, if it was tomatoes, to reshore 6-8% of tomato imports by growing in Essex.\" But the National Farmers Union says further projects like Rivenhall could be hampered by the government's new biodiversity net gain strategy, which forces all developers to benefit nature through their builds. Martin Emmett, chair of the NFU's Horticulture and Potatoes Board, says the policy was \"originally designed around housing estates, larger factories and commercial developments\". Read more:Inside Europe's biggest vertical farmWill there be a hosepipe ban in the UK? Consequently, companies may have to buy extra land to offset biodiversity impacts, which would affect similar investments across the country.

        "Content": "A woman has been stabbed to death in south London, police have said. Emergency crews were called to Frith Road in Croydon shortly after 9am on Saturday and treated two injured people at the scene. A woman in her 20s died at the scene, while a man in his 30s was taken to hospital with minor injuries. He has since been arrested on suspicion of murder and remains in hospital. Detectives are in the early stages of establishing what happened, the Metropolitan Police said. The force said initial enquiries suggest the incident began at a nearby address before escalating on to Frith Road. Superintendent Mitch Carr, who leads local policing in Croydon, said the force wanted to \"thank the members of the public, including a teenage boy, who bravely tried to help the victim\". \"This is a tragic incident where a young woman has lost her life and our thoughts are with her loved ones,\" he added. \"We believe that this was an isolated incident, but understand that this news will shock the local community.\""

        "Content": "Prison officers should be armed with lethal weapons to crack down on Islamist terrorists in jail, the shadow justice secretary has said. Highly trained teams should also be equipped with tasers, stun grenades and baton rounds to tackle dangerous criminals in high-security jails, Robert Jenrick said. The plan is taken from a series of recommendations by counter-extremism expert and former prison governor Ian Acheson. It comes after a prison officer at high-security prison Long Lartin in Worcestershire was stabbed on Friday morning with a weapon Sky News understands was brought in from outside the prison. It also follows several attacks on prison officers in jails. In April this year, the Manchester Arena bomb plotter, Hashem Abedi, allegedly assaulted prison staff by throwing hot oil on them and then launching a stabbing attack, injuring three officers. At Belmarsh prison, Southport killer Axel Rudakubana has been accused of throwing boiling water over an officer through the hatch in his cell door earlier this month. Mr Jenrick said: \"Islamist gangs and violent prisoners in our jails are out of control. It's a national security emergency, but the government is dithering. If they don't act soon, there is a very real risk that a prison officer is kidnapped or murdered in the line of duty, or that a terrorist attack is directed from inside prison.\" He said he commissioned Mr Acheson to conduct a rapid review into measures the government could adopt. The measures include removing all radical Islamist imams working in prisons, immediately rolling out high-collar stab vests to frontline officers, and mandating the quarterly release of data on religious conversions in prison and faith-based incidents. It also recommended legislating to overturn the De Silva ruling to strip back judicial interference in operational decisions by governors to isolate extremists. Mr Jenrick added: \"We have to stop pussy-footing around Islamist extremists and violent offenders in jails. \"That means arming specialist prison officer teams with tasers and stun grenades, as well as giving them access to lethal weapons in exceptional circumstances. \"If prison governors can't easily keep terrorist influencers and radicalising inmates apart from the mainstream prisoners they target, then we don't control our prisons - they do. We must take back control and restore order by giving officers the powers and protection they need.\" Mr Acheson said: \"Too often what goes wrong behind the walls of our high security jails passes unnoticed, as does the bravery of the men and women in uniform who deal every day with terrorists and other highly dangerous offenders. \"Robert Jenrick is right - the threat to officer safety is now intolerable and must be met decisively by the government. \"The balance inside too many of our prisons has shifted away from control by the state to mere containment and the price is soaring levels of staff assaults and wrecked rehabilitation. Broken officers can't help fix broken people - or protect the public from violent extremism.\" A Ministry of Justice source said: \"The government considers the introduction of lethal weapons into prisons would put prison officers at greater risk.\" They added: \"The last government added just 500 cells to our prison estate, and left our jails in total crisis. In 14 years, they closed 1,600 cells in the high-security estate, staff assaults soared, and experienced officers left in droves. Now the arsonists are pretending to be firefighters. \"This government is cleaning up the mess the last government left behind. We are building new prisons, with 2,400 new cells opened since we took office. And we take a zero-tolerance approach to violence and extremism inside.\""

        "Headline": "Hamas has said it wants amendments to the US-proposed ceasefire deal, offering to release hostages if the agreement achieves \"a permanent ceasefire\".",
        "Content": " Israel has confirmed its forces have killed Hamas's Gaza chief, Mohammad Sinwar, as US Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff called the group's counter-offer on a ceasefire \"totally unacceptable\". Mohammad Sinwar became the leader of the militant group in the Gaza Strip after his older brother Yahya Sinwar was killed last October. In a statement, the Israeli military said it had killed Sinwar on 13 May, and was the target of a strike on a hospital in southern Gaza. Hamas has neither confirmed nor denied his death, but Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told parliament on Wednesday that he had been \"eliminated\". Middle East correspondent Mohammed Sinwar was the younger brother of Yahyah Sinwar, the former leader of Hamas and mastermind behind the 7 October attacks, who was killed by IDF forces in Rafah last October. In January of this year, Mohammed was confirmed as the new leader of Hamas in Gaza, following the death of his brother. Among Palestinians, he never had the reputation of Yahya, but he was widely believed to have played a significant role in the kidnap and holding of IDF soldier Gilad Shalit in 2006 and demanded the release of Yahya Sinwar from Israeli prison as part of a swap deal. Born in Khan Younis, Mohammed Sinwar rose through the ranks of Hamas to become a senior commander in Al Qassam Brigades, the group's military wing. He was known as 'The Shadow', in part because of the junior role he played to his older brother and also because few images of him exist. He survived multiple assassination attempts and was previously incorrectly declared dead during Israel's war in Gaza. Sinwar had a reputation for being stubborn, and Israeli sources in the ceasefire negotiations blamed him for slowing the process and changing his demands at the last minute. The IDF has confirmed he was with the commander of the Rafah brigade, Mohammed Shabanah, in tunnels underneath the European Hospital in Gaza when the IDF struck in mid-May. Shabanah's death is significant because he was a likely successor to Sinwar.  It would leave Azadi al-Hadad, the Gaza City Brigade Commander, as the only living Hamas commander from 7 October.  He would likely be in line as the next Hamas chief in Gaza. Hamas seeks changes in US ceasefire proposal It comes as Hamas said it was seeking amendments to a US-proposed ceasefire deal, offering 10 living Israeli hostages and the bodies of 18 in exchange for Palestinian prisoners. On Thursday, the White House said Israel agreed to a 60-day ceasefire proposal, which would see the release of nine living hostages and half of the known hostages who have died over the course of a week. \n                  Last hospital in northern Gaza out of service after evacuation\n                 \n                  UK will 'seek to do more if it can' for Gaza's injured children, foreign secretary David Lammy says\n                 \n                  'What did they do to be burned and bombed?': Charity calls on UK to offer Gaza children life-saving treatment\n                 Israel and Hamas would then continue talks to bring the remaining hostages home, but Israel would retain the right to resume military action in Gaza if talks were to break down. In a statement about the proposal on Saturday, Hamas said its response \"aims to achieve a permanent ceasefire, a complete withdrawal from the Gaza Strip, and to ensure the flow of humanitarian aid to our people in the Strip\".  Hamas offer 'totally unacceptable' - Witkoff Donald Trump's special Middle East envoy, Mr Witkoff, said on social media that Hamas's response is \"totally unacceptable and only takes us backwards\". \"Hamas should accept the framework proposal we put forward as the basis for proximity talks, which we can begin immediately this coming week,\" he added. Senior Hamas official Basem Naim told Reuters that the group has not rejected the proposal but added Mr Witkoff's response was \"unfair\" and showed \"complete bias\" towards Israel. Israel has not yet responded to Hamas' counter-offer, but has previously rejected the conditions and demanded the complete disarmament and dismantling of the group. 👉 Listen to Sky News Daily on your podcast app 👈 Meanwhile, Gaza aid groups have said dozens of World Food Programme (WFP) trucks carrying flour to Gaza bakeries had been hijacked by armed groups and subsequently looted by people.

Flares and fireworks were set off in Paris after PSG beat Inter Milan 5-0 in Munich - the biggest ever victory in a Champions League final. Around 5,400 police were deployed across Paris after the game, with officers using tear gas and pepper spray on the Champs Elysees. At the top of the Champs-Élysées, a water cannon was used to protect the Place de l'Étoile, near the landmark Arc de Triomphe. Police said a large crowd not watching the match tried to push through a barrier to make contact with officers. Some 131 arrests were made, including 30 who broke into a shoe shop on the Champs-Élysées.

Police lined up in front of the PSG end of the stadium at the final whistle, but struggled to contain the fans for several minutes when they came down from the stands following the trophy presentation. Desire Doue, the 19-year-old who scored two goals and assisted one in the final, said after the game: \"I don't have words. But what I can say is, 'Thank you Paris,' we did it.\" Despite being an Olympique de Marseille supporter, French President Emmanuel Macron also said on social media: \"A glorious day for PSG! \"Bravo, we are all proud. Paris, the capital of Europe this evening.\" Mr Macron's office said the president would receive the players at the Elysee Palace on Sunday.

        "Content": " Indonesian police are questioning six people after a rock collapse at a quarry in West Java. The quarry owner is among those being quizzed as the investigation continues into what caused the incident at the Gunung Kuda quarry on Friday. A dozen survivors have been found following the collapse in Cirebon district. By Saturday afternoon, rescuers had retrieved 16 bodies, and one of the survivors died in hospital, according to local police chief Sumarni. She said rescuers are searching for eight people still believed to be trapped in the rubble. \"The search operation has been hampered by bad weather, unstable soil and rugged terrain,\" added Sumarni, who goes by a single name, as is customary for many Indonesians.

Last year, a landslide triggered by torrential rains wiped out an unauthorised gold mining operation on Indonesia's Sumatra island, killing at least 15 people.

        "Content": "\n          US correspondent\n              @marthakelner\n  California's best high school athletes are competing this weekend at the State Championships. The stadium in Clovis, a city in the foothills of the Sierra Nevada mountains, is dressed for the occasion. Huge banners welcome athletes from across the state, food stalls line the concourse and teenagers sell event programmes. \"Good luck to all the athletes and their coaches,\" the inside of the programme reads. Many of the athletes have trained for years and, for some, receiving lucrative university scholarships rests on their performance here. But one issue, one competitor, is dominating the chatter. \"Which one is she?\" I hear a group of boys asking. They're talking about AB Hernandez, a 16-year-old transgender girl, who is now the focus of a legal, political and cultural row. She was born a boy but has transitioned and now competes against the girls. \n                  All passengers confirmed dead after California plane crash\n                 \n                  FBI names suspect in California fertility clinic bombing as Guy Edward Bartkus\n                 \n                  Alcatraz: Why does Donald Trump want to reopen the notorious prison - and did anyone ever escape?\n                 Hernandez is favourite to win the long jump and the triple jump and is also competing in the high jump. She led in all three events after preliminary rounds on Friday. Her inclusion in the girls category has become a national conversation. Read more: World Athletics to introduce sex testing As she competes, a plane flies over the stadium trailing a banner, which reads \"No boys in girls' sports.\" It was organised and paid for by two women's advocacy groups. A small protest is also taking place on the road outside. \"Save girls sports,\" one poster reads. \"XX does not equal XY,\" reads another. Aurelia Moore is a local mum and sport fan. \"These kids get up at the crack of dawn,\" she says. \"They work out before school, they go to school, they work out after school, the weekends they work out. And for that just to be taken away so that we can make a boy feel better is just it's wrong. It's very wrong.\" Transgender inclusion is a thorny issue but a vote winner for President Trump, who campaigned with a promise to \"kick out men from women's sport\". He signed an executive order seeking to ban transgender women from female sport. Trump is now threatening to withdraw federal funding from California over Hernandez's participation in this athletics event. In a social media post, he wrote: \"As a Male, he was a less than average competitor. As a Female, this transitioned person is practically unbeatable.\" 'No special advantage' Transgender rights activists attended the event to support Hernandez, cheering her efforts in the high jump. Jessica Schultz is a representative of the party for socialism and liberation, a communist political group. \"All girls deserve to play in girls' sports and trans girls are girls,\" she says. \"So they don't have any extra extreme advantage than somebody who is naturally tall or has naturally wide wingspan like Michael Phelps. \"I'm surprised that the president has time to concern himself with a high school athletic competition,\" she adds, \"but it is not surprising because he has a lot of hateful ideals\". Hernandez has required security at previous events because of abuse against her. A video recently went viral showing her mother being harangued by mums of other student athletes. One of the voices in the video is Sonja Shaw, a school board president for Chino Valley, a district of California. \"I said, boys are boys, girls are girls,\" she says. \"And then, I turned to the stands and I'm like, 'is there anybody that's okay with a boy competing against the girls right now?'\" Girls 'can't win' There are hundreds of thousands of high school students playing sport in California, but only a handful of publicised cases of transgender girls playing girls' sport. I ask Sonja if the issue is being overblown? \"Absolutely not because it's growing,\" she says. \"You have girls who should be on that first-place podium. They work their whole life. Their dream is to be a winner and they can't even win, they can't even compete against these boys.\" In response to the backlash about Hernandez's participation, California is now allowing more cisgender girls to compete here. They may also award two winners if Hernandez finishes first. It's a messy and controversial situation and it's not going away."

        "Content": "\n          Climate reporter\n              @SeabrookClimate\n  Torrents of water that barrelled through a market town in Nigeria’s north-central state of Niger this week have now killed at least 151 people, officials said on Saturday. Heavy rain that began falling early on Thursday submerged the town of Mokwa, a major trading and transportation hub west of Abuja, where traders buy beans, onions and other food. The deluge washed away sections of roads and bridges and left some buildings almost entirely underwater. On Friday, the death count rapidly soared from 21 to more than 100. As search efforts continued on Saturday, the number climbed again to 151, spokesperson for Niger State emergency service Ibrahim Audu Husseini said. And it inflicted further misery still, injuring at least 11 and displacing more than 3,000 people, while some are still unaccounted for. Mohamed Adow, director of Kenya-based thinktank Power Shift Africa, called it a \"cruel irony\" that parts of Africa can be \"baked dry and then suffer from floods that destroy lives and livelihoods\". He told Sky News: \"The terrible floods in Nigeria are another reminder that Africa stands on the front line of the climate crisis.\" Polluting countries must \"urgently\" slash fossil fuel emissions that drive climate change and target climate funding at those who need it most, Mr Adow added. Residents have been picking their way through the wreckage and lamenting the loss of lives and livelihoods. Kazeem Muhammed said: \"We lost many lives, and the properties, our farm produce. Those that have their storage, have lost it.\" Nigerian President Bola Tinubu said he has directed the activation of the national emergency response centre to assist the state quickly. \"Search-and-rescue operations are ongoing, and all relevant federal agencies have been mobilised to support the state government's efforts,\" President Tinubu said in a late night message. \"Relief materials and temporary shelter assistance are being deployed without delay. We will ensure that no Nigerian affected by this disaster is left behind or unheard of.\" In February, the UK government announced a cut to the aid budget from 0.5% to 0.3% of gross national income from 2027, to pay for increased defence spending. It followed other cuts by the previous government, and NGOs warn countries, including Nigeria, South Sudan, and Zimbabwe, will be hit hardest. Gideon Rabinowitz, director of policy and advocacy at Bond, the UK network for NGOs, said: \"The cuts to UK aid, alongside reductions in humanitarian and development funding by countries around the world, undermine our capacity to support countries like Nigeria - those that have contributed the least to the climate crisis but are suffering its worst impacts.\" \"We urgently need an impact assessment of the UK aid cuts.\" Sky News has contacted the UK Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office for comment. Read more:The furious rise of climate whiplashMore than 40% of Europe in droughtMore than 90 wildfires out of control in Canada What causes Nigeria's flooding? Flooding is common in Nigeria in the rainy season, which began in April. On Friday, local officials said poor infrastructure had exacerbated the recent damage, appealing for \"long overdue\" construction of waterways in the area to begin. But climate change adds an extra layer of danger. That's because hotter air can hold more moisture, so when it rains, it rains harder. Community leader Aliki Musa said Mokwa people are not used to such flooding. Heavy flooding that killed hundreds of people in Nigeria during 2022 was made at least 80 times more likely and 20% more intense by climate change, scientists at World Weather Attribution found."

        "Content": "Iran further increased its stockpile of uranium to near weapons-grade levels and has carried out secret nuclear activities, the UN watchdog has said. A report by the Vienna-based International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) said that as of 17 May, Iran has amassed 408.6kg of uranium enriched up to 60% - an increase of 133.8kg since the IAEA's last report in February. That material is a short, technical step away from weapons-grade levels of 90%. Issuing a stern warning, the IAEA said Iran is now \"the only non-nuclear-weapon state to produce such material\", which it said is of \"serious concern\". IAEA chief, Rafael Mariano Grossi, said Tehran has enough uranium enriched to near-weapons-grade levels to make \"several\" nuclear bombs, if it chose to do so. A separate IAEA report also found traces of uranium at two to four sites that indicated Tehran had hosted secret experiments. It concluded that \"these three locations, and other possible related locations, were part of an undeclared structured nuclear programme carried out by Iran until the early 2000s and that some activities used undeclared nuclear material\". The findings of this report, in particular, are important, as they could lead to Iran being referred to the UN Security Council. European countries could also reimplement sanctions on Iran that were lifted under the original Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action in 2015. More immediately, it is likely to complicate recent talks between Iran and the US over a possible nuclear deal that Donald Trump is trying to reach. On 29 May, senior Iranian officials dismissed speculation about an imminent nuclear deal with the US, emphasising that any agreement must fully lift sanctions and allow the country's nuclear programme to continue. Tehran has always said it wants to master nuclear technology for peaceful purposes and has long denied accusations by Western powers that it is seeking to develop nuclear weapons.  However, the IAEA report spelt out that Iran's cooperation with the IAEA continues to be \"less than satisfactory\" in \"a number of respects\". Israel said the IAEA report was a clear warning sign that \"Iran is totally determined to complete its nuclear weapons programme\", according to a statement from Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office. It said the IAEA's report \"strongly reinforces what Israel has been saying for years - the purpose of Iran's nuclear program is not peaceful\". It comes after Mr Trump told Mr Netanyahu to hold off striking Iran to give his government more time to push for a new nuclear deal with Tehran. Read more:Inside Iran special - how close is a nuclear deal? Mr Trump said on Friday that he still thinks a deal could be completed in the \"not too distant future\". \"They don't want to be blown up. They would rather make a deal,\" the US president said, adding: \"That would be a great thing that we could have a deal without bombs being dropped all over the Middle East.\""

Operation Dynamo, from 26 May to 4 June 1940, saw more than 338,000 British, French and Belgian troops, trapped by the invading German forces around Dunkirk, brought home by roughly 1,000 vessels in a desperate and near-miraculous rescue over more than a week of sailings. It was one of the turning points of the Second World War, saving the Allied cause in Europe from total collapse, allowing them to regroup after the Nazi Blitzkrieg threatened to sweep Germany to a rapid and complete victory. One of the soldiers saved in what came to be known as the Miracle of Dunkirk was Queen Camilla's father, Major Bruce Shand, and she paid tribute to him on Saturday. In a post on Instagram, the Queen pointed to the \"eclectic collection of seafarers, ferry masters, barge hands, fishermen and children, with their little ships\" that carried out the stunning rescue. In his memoirs, she said, Major Shand wrote that he took shelter in a ship \"'commanded by a midshipman who looked about 12, assisted by a boatswain aged 80'\". She said he and his comrades \"would today be grateful beyond words for this lifeline\". Scroll down for pictures of the boats that took part in the memorial sailing."

        "Content": "\n          US correspondent\n              @marthakelner\n  California's best high school athletes are competing this weekend at the State Championships. The stadium in Clovis, a city in the foothills of the Sierra Nevada mountains, is dressed for the occasion. Huge banners welcome athletes from across the state, food stalls line the concourse and teenagers sell event programmes. \"Good luck to all the athletes and their coaches,\" the inside of the programme reads. Many of the athletes have trained for years and, for some, receiving lucrative university scholarships rests on their performance here. But one issue, one competitor, is dominating the chatter. \"Which one is she?\" I hear a group of boys asking. They're talking about AB Hernandez, a 16-year-old transgender girl, who is now the focus of a legal, political and cultural row. She was born a boy but has transitioned and now competes against the girls. \n                  All passengers confirmed dead after California plane crash\n                 \n                  FBI names suspect in California fertility clinic bombing as Guy Edward Bartkus\n                 \n                  Alcatraz: Why does Donald Trump want to reopen the notorious prison - and did anyone ever escape?\n                 Hernandez is favourite to win the long jump and the triple jump and is also competing in the high jump. She led in all three events after preliminary rounds on Friday. Her inclusion in the girls category has become a national conversation. Read more: World Athletics to introduce sex testing As she competes, a plane flies over the stadium trailing a banner, which reads \"No boys in girls' sports.\" It was organised and paid for by two women's advocacy groups. A small protest is also taking place on the road outside. \"Save girls sports,\" one poster reads. \"XX does not equal XY,\" reads another. Aurelia Moore is a local mum and sport fan. \"These kids get up at the crack of dawn,\" she says. \"They work out before school, they go to school, they work out after school, the weekends they work out. And for that just to be taken away so that we can make a boy feel better is just it's wrong. It's very wrong.\" Transgender inclusion is a thorny issue but a vote winner for President Trump, who campaigned with a promise to \"kick out men from women's sport\". He signed an executive order seeking to ban transgender women from female sport. Trump is now threatening to withdraw federal funding from California over Hernandez's participation in this athletics event. In a social media post, he wrote: \"As a Male, he was a less than average competitor. As a Female, this transitioned person is practically unbeatable.\" 'No special advantage' Transgender rights activists attended the event to support Hernandez, cheering her efforts in the high jump. Jessica Schultz is a representative of the party for socialism and liberation, a communist political group. \"All girls deserve to play in girls' sports and trans girls are girls,\" she says. \"So they don't have any extra extreme advantage than somebody who is naturally tall or has naturally wide wingspan like Michael Phelps. \"I'm surprised that the president has time to concern himself with a high school athletic competition,\" she adds, \"but it is not surprising because he has a lot of hateful ideals\". Hernandez has required security at previous events because of abuse against her. A video recently went viral showing her mother being harangued by mums of other student athletes. One of the voices in the video is Sonja Shaw, a school board president for Chino Valley, a district of California. \"I said, boys are boys, girls are girls,\" she says. \"And then, I turned to the stands and I'm like, 'is there anybody that's okay with a boy competing against the girls right now?'\" Girls 'can't win' There are hundreds of thousands of high school students playing sport in California, but only a handful of publicised cases of transgender girls playing girls' sport. I ask Sonja if the issue is being overblown? \"Absolutely not because it's growing,\" she says. \"You have girls who should be on that first-place podium. They work their whole life. Their dream is to be a winner and they can't even win, they can't even compete against these boys.\" In response to the backlash about Hernandez's participation, California is now allowing more cisgender girls to compete here. They may also award two winners if Hernandez finishes first. It's a messy and controversial situation and it's not going away."

        "Content": " Millions of honeybees escaped after a lorry transporting their hives overturned in Washington state. The truck was carrying about 70,000lbs (31,751kg) of hives when the incident happened near Lynden, close to the Canadian border. The Whatcom County Sheriff's Office (WCSO) urged people to stay away from the scene as about 250 million bees were thought to have got out. \"Avoid the area due to the potential of bee escape and swarming,\" WCSO said on social media. The driver, who was unhurt, had apparently miscalculated a tight turn, causing the lorry trailer to roll into a ditch early on Friday, county emergency management said. Emergency crews were assisted by several local beekeepers to help recover, restore and reset the hives, according to the sheriff's office. \"Thank you to the wonderful community of beekeepers: over two dozen showed up to help ensure the rescue of millions of pollinating honeybees would be as successful as possible,\" the sheriff's office wrote on social media. \n                  Britons urged to stop mowing lawns to boost butterfly numbers 'in long-term decline'\n                 \n                  Wild beavers to make a comeback in England after government approves reintroduction\n                 \n                  Bring back wolves to Scotland to reach net zero, says controversial research\n                 They believe many of the bees can be recovered, hoping the vital pollinators will return to their hives and find their queen bee over the next day or two. \"The goal is to save as many of the bees as possible,\" WCSO said. Many commercial US beekeepers transport their hives all around the country to help pollinate farmed crops. Honeybees, though not native to the United States, have become indispensable to its food industry, but are declining at an alarming rate. They pollinate $15bn (£11.1bn) worth of crops each year, including more than 130 types of fruits, nuts, according to the US Department of Agriculture. But commercial beekeepers lost on average over 60% of their colonies over the winter, according to a survey by Project Apis m. published in February. \"These alarming numbers could significantly impact crop pollination of essential foods and harm the profitability of the nation's agriculture industry,\" it said at the time. According to the non-profit organisation, one of the greatest threats is the lack of forage, which is being depleted by climate change, urban sprawl and pesticides."

        "Content": "\n          US correspondent\n              @Stone_SkyNews\n  It was billed by the US president as a press conference. But that was accurate only to the extent that there were a few select reporters asking questions in the Oval Office. They were part of the \"pool\", a chosen group of journalists on a rota to cover the president's movements each day. The rota used to be drawn up by the White House Correspondents Association on a rotating basis. The Trump administration has changed that. They now compile the pool. And on Friday, as it happens, the media seemed particularly compliant. The questions were soft. Painfully so. There was one on whether the president had any marital advice for his French counterpart - who appeared to be shoved by his wife the other day. Another was about whether Musk thought it was harder to colonise Mars or reform government. There were one or two about the pressing issues of the day, like Gaza, but nothing that could be described as probing or doing what we are supposed to be there to do - hold power to account. And Musk, under Trump, has without question wielded immense power over the past few months; unprecedented for an unelected official. He upended the workings of federal government, slashing thousands of jobs. He forced the closure of whole departments like USAID, changing America's global footprint. He did it all with a sense of enjoyment. The literal chainsaw to bureaucracy was memorable.  There is little debate in America about the need to cut government bureaucracy or cut the debt. America, more than any country I have lived in, is a place full of bloat and waste. Yet it was Musk's methods which caused so much unease among his many critics. They argued that where a scalpel was definitely needed, Musk instead deployed a sledgehammer. At times, his flamboyant style was a neat distraction from the substance of Trump's sweeping policy changes. But none of that was interrogated in this \"press conference\". Instead, the inane questions went on. Trump was asked if he would pardon Sean \"Diddy\" Combs should he be convicted - he didn't say \"no\", but there was no follow up to examine why. He was asked if he wished he'd become a judge given that they are blocking so much of his legislation. He laughed. There was a moment when irony appeared to have died altogether. In the same breath as trumpeting his success in cutting government waste - when he has, in fact, achieved a fraction of the $2trn savings he promised - Musk congratulated Trump for deploying so much gold around the Oval Office. The presidential office has had an extensive, gaudy gold makeover costing undisclosed sums. One reporter did ask about Musk's alleged drug use. But by attributing the story to the New York Times - who have made the allegations - Musk had an easy out. \"Why believe that fake news,\" he essentially said. Surely the obvious question was \"Mr Musk, when was the last time you took ketamine or ecstasy?\" It never came. Read more:Trump furious over 'TACO' dig - what inspired the phrase?Seven things you might not have known about Musk We did get the answer to one burning question, trivial though it was, given what's going on in the world. But it took 41 minutes for any of the reporters to ask it: Why was Elon Musk sporting a shiner on his right eye? His five-year-old son, X, whacked him, he said. Maybe young X has some sympathy for the thousands of federal workers - ordinary Americans - who Musk fired at his president's pleasure."

        "Content": "\n          City editor\n              @MarkKleinmanSky\n Ministers are to kick off the hunt for a new chair of the communications regulator as Lord Grade of Yarmouth prepares to bow out after a single term at the helm. Sky News has learnt that the Department for Science, Innovation and Technology (DSIT) - which now leads oversight of Ofcom in Whitehall - is drawing up proposals to launch a recruitment process in the coming months. Lord Grade, the veteran broadcast executive who held senior posts at the BBC, ITV and Channel 4, has served as Ofcom chair since May 2022. His four-year term is not due to end for another 11 months, and there was no suggestion this weekend that he would leave the role ahead of that point. Insiders said, however, that there was little prospect of him seeking to be reappointed for a second term in the job. The now non-affiliated peer's appointment to the post in 2022 came after a controversial recruitment process and was signed off by Nadine Dorries, the then Tory culture secretary. Responsibility for Ofcom board appointments has switched since then from the Department for Culture, Media and Sport. \n                  TikTok's new initiative to stop teenagers' late-night doomscrolling\n                 \n                  Ofcom sets out new codes of practice to protect children online\n                 \n                  Suicide forum first to be investigated by Ofcom under new online safety laws\n                 Peter Kyle, the science secretary, authorised the recruitment of Tamara Ingram, an advertising industry stalwart, as Ofcom's deputy chair, last November.  Ofcom takes on online harms The search for a new Ofcom chair will come after a significant extension of its remit to encompass areas such as online harms. Both DCMS, which has responsibility for the media industry, and the Department for Business and Trade also have substantial engagement with Ofcom. As well as a role in appointing directors to the board of state-owned Channel 4, which is hunting both a chair and chief executive, Ofcom regulates companies such as Royal Mail, as well as the BBC. This week, the watchdog said it was pursuing action against the formerly publicly owned postal services company over its failure to hit statutory delivery targets. Ofcom also regulates the UK telecoms industry, making it one of the largest economic regulators in Britain. Data centres may be next The body may also be handed regulatory oversight of the fast-growing data centre industry. One of the tasks of Lord Grade's successor is likely to be long-term executive leadership succession planning. Dame Melanie Dawes, Ofcom's chief executive, has held the role since 2020, although there is no indication that she intends to step down in the short term. It was unclear this weekend whether any of Ofcom's existing board members might seek to take over from Lord Grade. Its slate of non-executive directors includes recently appointed Lord Allan of Hallam, a former MP, and Ben Verwaayen, the former BT Group chief executive. Mr Verwaayen is due to step down from the Ofcom board at the end of the year. The hunt for Ofcom's next chair will come amid a push led by Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer and Chancellor Rachel Reeves to shake up Britain's economic regulators as they seek ways to remove red tape from the private sector. DSIT has been contacted for comment, while Ofcom declined to comment."

        "Content": "\n          Political correspondent\n              @amandaakass\n There is \"no doubt\" the UK \"will spend 3% of our GDP on defence\" in the next parliament, the defence secretary has said. John Healey's comments come ahead of the publication of the government's Strategic Defence Review (SDR) on Monday. This is an assessment of the state of the armed forces, the threats facing the UK, and the military transformation required to meet them. Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has previously set out a \"clear ambition\" to raise defence spending to 3% in the next parliament \"subject to economic and fiscal conditions\". Mr Healey has now told The Times newspaper there is a \"certain decade of rising defence spending\" to come, adding that this commitment \"allows us to plan for the long term. It allows us to deal with the pressures.\" A government source insisted the defence secretary was \"expressing an opinion, which is that he has full confidence that the government will be able to deliver on its ambition\", rather than making a new commitment. The UK currently spends 2.3% of GDP on defence, with Sir Keir announcing plans to increase that to 2.5% by 2027 in February. \n                  Russian-linked hackers posing as journalists targeted Ministry of Defence, government says\n                 \n                  Defence secretary warns this is 'the critical year' for Ukraine - as £450m in funding allocated\n                 \n                  It's a critical time for the MoD - so who is Defence Secretary John Healey?\n                 This followed mounting pressure from the White House for European nations to do more to take on responsibility for their own security and the defence of Ukraine. The 2.3% to 2.5% increase is being paid for by controversial cuts to the international aid budget, but there are big questions over where the funding for a 3% rise would be found, given the tight state of government finances. While a commitment will help underpin the planning assumptions made in the SDR, there is of course no guarantee a Labour government would still be in power during the next parliament to have to fulfil that pledge.  A statement from the Ministry of Defence makes it clear that the official government position has not changed in line with the defence secretary's comments. The statement reads: \"This government has announced the largest sustained increase to defence spending since the end of the Cold War - 2.5% by 2027 and 3% in the next parliament when fiscal and economic conditions allow, including an extra £5bn this financial year. \"The SDR will rightly set the vision for how that uplift will be spent, including new capabilities to put us at the leading edge of innovation in NATO, investment in our people and making defence an engine for growth across the UK - making Britain more secure at home and strong abroad.\" Sir Keir commissioned the review shortly after taking office in July 2024. It is being led by Lord Robertson, a former Labour defence secretary and NATO secretary general. The Ministry of Defence has already trailed a number of announcements as part of the review, including plans for a new Cyber and Electromagnetic Command and a £1bn battlefield system known as the Digital Targeting Web, which we're told will \"better connect armed forces weapons systems and allow battlefield decisions for targeting enemy threats to be made and executed faster\".

Mr Healey pledged to \"turn round what has been a national scandal for decades\", with 8,000 military family homes currently unfit for habitation. He said: \"The Strategic Defence Review, in the broad, will recognise that the fact that the world is changing, threats are increasing. \"In this new era of threat, we need a new era for defence and so the Strategic Defence Review will be the vision and direction for the way that we've got to strengthen our armed forces to make us more secure at home, stronger abroad, but also learn the lessons from Ukraine as well. \"So an armed forces that can be more capable of innovation more quickly, stronger to deter the threats that we face and always with people at the heart of our forces… which is why the housing commitments that we make through this strategic defence review are so important for the future.\""

        "Content": "\n          Security and Defence Editor\n              @haynesdeborah\n The UK will buy up to 7,000 long-range missiles, rockets and drones and build at least six weapons factories in a £1.5bn push to rearm at a time of growing threats. The plan, announced by the government over the weekend, will form part of Sir Keir Starmer's long-awaited Strategic Defence Review, which will be published on Monday. However, it lacks key details, including when the first arms plant will be built, when the first missile will be made, or even what kind of missiles, drones and rockets will be purchased. The government is yet to appoint a new senior leader to take on the job of \"national armaments director\", who will oversee the whole effort. Andy Start, the incumbent head of Defence Equipment and Support - the branch of defence charged with buying kit - is still doing the beefed-up role of national armaments director as a sluggish process to recruit someone externally rumbles on. Revealing some of its content ahead of time, the Ministry of Defence said the defence review will recommend an \"always on\" production capacity for munitions, drawing on lessons learned from Ukraine, which has demonstrated the vital importance of large production lines. It will also call for an increase in stockpiles of munitions - something that is vitally needed for the army, Royal Navy and Royal Air Force to be able to keep fighting beyond a few days. Sky News will launch a new podcast series on 10 June based around a wargame that simulates an attack by Russia against the UK to test Britain's defences \"The hard-fought lessons from [Vladimir] Putin's illegal invasion of Ukraine show a military is only as strong as the industry that stands behind them,\" John Healey, the defence secretary, said in a statement released on Saturday night. \"We are strengthening the UK's industrial base to better deter our adversaries and make the UK secure at home and strong abroad.\" The UK used to have a far more resilient defence industry during the Cold War, with the capacity to manufacture missiles and other weapons and ammunition at speed and at scale. However, much of that depth, which costs money to sustain, was lost following the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, when successive governments switched funding priorities away from defence and into areas such as health, welfare and economic growth. Even after Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022 and a huge increase in demand from Kyiv for munitions from its allies, production lines at UK factories were slow to expand. Sky News visited a plant run by the defence company Thales in Belfast last year that makes N-LAW anti-tank missiles used in Ukraine. Its staff at the time only worked weekday shifts between 7am and 4pm. Under this new initiative, the government said the UK will build at least six new \"munitions and energetics\" factories. Energetic materials include explosives, propellants and pyrotechnics, which are required in the manufacturing of weapons. There were no details, however, on whether these will be national factories or built in partnership with defence companies, or a timeline for this to happen. There was also no information on where they would be located or what kind of weapons they would make. In addition, it was announced that the UK will buy \"up to 7,000 UK-built long-range weapons for the UK Armed Forces\", though again without specifying what. It is understood these weapons will include a mix of missiles, rockets and drones. Sources within the defence industry criticised the lack of detail, which is so often the case with announcements by the Ministry of Defence. The sources said small and medium-sized companies in particular are struggling to survive as they await clarity from the Ministry of Defence over a range of different contracts. One source described a sense of \"paralysis\". The prime minister launched the defence review last July, almost a year ago. But there had been a sense of drift within the Ministry of Defence beforehand, in the run-up to last year's general election. The source said: \"While the government's intentions are laudable, the lack of detail in this announcement is indicative of how we treat defence in this country. \"Headline figures, unmatched by clear intent and delivery timelines which ultimately leave industry no closer to knowing what, or when, the MOD want their bombs and bullets. \"After nearly 18 months of decision and spending paralysis, what we need now is a clear demand signal from the Ministry of Defence that allows industry to start scaling production, not grand gestures with nothing to back it up.\" As well as rearming the nation, the government said the £1.5bn investment in new factories and weapons would create around 1,800 jobs across the UK."

        "Content": "Prison officers should be armed with lethal weapons to crack down on Islamist terrorists in jail, the shadow justice secretary has said. Highly trained teams should also be equipped with tasers, stun grenades and baton rounds to tackle dangerous criminals in high-security jails, Robert Jenrick said. The plan is taken from a series of recommendations by counter-extremism expert and former prison governor Ian Acheson. It comes after a prison officer at high-security prison Long Lartin in Worcestershire was stabbed on Friday morning with a weapon Sky News understands was brought in from outside the prison. It also follows several attacks on prison officers in jails. In April this year, the Manchester Arena bomb plotter, Hashem Abedi, allegedly assaulted prison staff by throwing hot oil on them and then launching a stabbing attack, injuring three officers. At Belmarsh prison, Southport killer Axel Rudakubana has been accused of throwing boiling water over an officer through the hatch in his cell door earlier this month. Mr Jenrick said: \"Islamist gangs and violent prisoners in our jails are out of control. It's a national security emergency, but the government is dithering. If they don't act soon, there is a very real risk that a prison officer is kidnapped or murdered in the line of duty, or that a terrorist attack is directed from inside prison.\" He said he commissioned Mr Acheson to conduct a rapid review into measures the government could adopt. The measures include removing all radical Islamist imams working in prisons, immediately rolling out high-collar stab vests to frontline officers, and mandating the quarterly release of data on religious conversions in prison and faith-based incidents. It also recommended legislating to overturn the De Silva ruling to strip back judicial interference in operational decisions by governors to isolate extremists. Mr Jenrick added: \"We have to stop pussy-footing around Islamist extremists and violent offenders in jails. \"That means arming specialist prison officer teams with tasers and stun grenades, as well as giving them access to lethal weapons in exceptional circumstances. \"If prison governors can't easily keep terrorist influencers and radicalising inmates apart from the mainstream prisoners they target, then we don't control our prisons - they do. We must take back control and restore order by giving officers the powers and protection they need.\" Mr Acheson said: \"Too often what goes wrong behind the walls of our high security jails passes unnoticed, as does the bravery of the men and women in uniform who deal every day with terrorists and other highly dangerous offenders. \"Robert Jenrick is right - the threat to officer safety is now intolerable and must be met decisively by the government. \"The balance inside too many of our prisons has shifted away from control by the state to mere containment and the price is soaring levels of staff assaults and wrecked rehabilitation. Broken officers can't help fix broken people - or protect the public from violent extremism.\" A Ministry of Justice source said: \"The government considers the introduction of lethal weapons into prisons would put prison officers at greater risk.\" They added: \"The last government added just 500 cells to our prison estate, and left our jails in total crisis. In 14 years, they closed 1,600 cells in the high-security estate, staff assaults soared, and experienced officers left in droves. Now the arsonists are pretending to be firefighters. \"This government is cleaning up the mess the last government left behind. We are building new prisons, with 2,400 new cells opened since we took office. And we take a zero-tolerance approach to violence and extremism inside.\""

        "Content": "\n          Health correspondent\n              @ashishskynews\n A leading British palliative care consultant has described the assisted dying bill as \"not fit for purpose\" and is urging MPs to stop the bill from progressing any further. Rejecting assurances from supporters of assisted dying who claim the proposed British version would be based on the scheme used in the American state of Oregon - widely regarded as the model with the most safeguards - Dr Amy Proffitt said \"it's far from a safe system\". \"The majority, 80% of the people that have assisted death have government insurance with Medicaid or Medicare suggesting that the vulnerable in society are not worth it,\" she said. \"Put that into our NHS and what does it say about us as a society... those with disability, those with learning disabilities, those with social deprivation?\" Dr Proffitt added: \"I think it's deeply dangerous for the bill that has been proposed and it needs to be scrapped and we go back and look again.\" She and other leading palliative care doctors have expressed concern about the erosion of end of life care if the bill passes. It is a fear expressed by Britain's hospice sector. Read more:Why is assisted dying so controversial - and where is it already legal? Dr Ted Gruber, a retired Oregon doctor who has assisted numerous assisted deaths, says those fears have not been realised and the state's hospice sector has strengthened since the introduction of assisted dying in Oregon in 1994. He says he has never had any doubts about his role as a physician who assists a patient's death. \"I've never been conflicted,\" he explains. \"I've attended a number of them. \"Each of the ones I've attended has been almost sacred if you will, it's hard to explain but with the family there, the family dog in the bed, with the music playing that they want. \"Everyone's sad, everyone's crying, it's not a joyful moment but in a way it's kind of a sacred moment.\" Oregon's assisted dying laws have not seen the same number of changes to widen the cohort groups who would qualify for an assisted death in the way, for example, Canada has. So it has managed to steer clear of the \"slippery slope\" criticism levelled at other programmes. Dr Gruber also said the assisted death scheme in Oregon had enhanced the patient-physician relationship. \"The role of the doctor who is attending the dying patient is one of listening and paying attention to what the needs of the dying patient are and it's eroded when the patient can't trust the doctor,\" he said. \"When I've seen a patient who has tried to talk to a doctor about aid in dying and they're like 'oh, I won't do that, I'm opposed to it'... well that doesn't enhance a doctor-patient relationship, it will be enhanced when a doctor says let's talk about why you want to ask that.\" Read more from Sky News:Assisted dying law 'unworkable, unaffordable and naive'MPs criticise Esther Rantzen's assisted dying intervention Oregon's assisted death model is the closest to what is being proposed in the UK. Both require it to apply only to adults who are terminally ill, mentally competent, and have six months to live or less, and to take the drugs themselves. But while Oregon cases are reviewed by two doctors, in the UK they would be reviewed by a panel including a psychiatrist, a social worker and a legal professional. In Oregon, the drugs are posted to the individual for them to take when ready, whereas in the UK, a healthcare professional would bring them on the day of the planned death. Marcy Lehman's father Ted was \"her hero, the person I looked up to'. An Oregon doctor, he chose to have an assisted death at home in Portland surrounded by his family. Marcy was there by his side. And it was for her, her mother and ultimately her father, the right decision. \"This was my hero, the person I looked up to, and now the roles were switched and I was taking care of him, and I had to be his hero,\" Marcy said. She explained that his stomach cancer \"was starting to work up his system so he couldn't eat.\" \"My dad was a strong person and stronger even up until his death,\" Marcy added. \"He didn't want someone to have to go to the bathroom with him to help with that or to feed him that wasn't what he wanted - yeah, he was in pain, he could endure the pain, but it was really more the dignified way he wanted to leave this Earth.\" Ted's family are grateful that they live in a state where assisted death is allowed. It's a choice they would make again if they had to. Now the UK must soon decide if that same choice is made available over here. The Terminally Ill Adults (End Of Life) Bill was introduced to the House of Commons last October. Later this month, MPs will be asked to vote again in a ballot that will decide the fate of the proposed legislation."

        "Content": "\n          News correspondent\n              @AlicePorterTV\n Forty hectares of greenhouses, heated by the burning of rubbish, are set to be built in Essex - making it the largest low-carbon horticulture site in Europe. These greenhouses will be the first of their kind and could provide around 6% of the tomatoes consumed in the UK. It should begin operating in 2027, when almost all the county's household rubbish will come to the Rivenhall site, where it will then be burnt in an incinerator. Gareth Jones works for waste company Indaver, which is building the facility. He said: \"The boiler produces steam and some of that steam we'll divert to our new heat exchange, and that will produce the hot water that we'll be sending over to our greenhouses. \"The rest of the steam goes to the turbine, so it produces electricity from the substation, and some of the electricity will go directly to the greenhouses.\" Currently, Essex's household waste goes to landfill where it gives off greenhouse gasses, particularly methane. \n                  Nigeria floods: At least 110 dead as heavy flooding submerges thousands of houses\n                 \n                  More than 40% of Europe slides into drought, including pockets of Greece, southern Italy and Spain\n                 \n                  Four Just Stop Oil activists jailed for plotting to disrupt Manchester Airport\n                 Indaver claims that the CO2 emitted at the Rivenhall site is 20% less than if the rubbish had gone to landfill, and there are additional environmental benefits. According to Defra, almost half of the UK's fresh vegetables are imported. Tomatoes often come from Morocco, Spain and the Netherlands. But there is growing concern about the vast number of plastic polytunnels in the south of Spain. Almeria's 'Sea of Greenhouses' are even visible from space, and there are regular droughts in the area. Trucks then bring the produce all the way to the UK, releasing thousands of tonnes of CO2 en route. Rivenhall Greenhouse project director Ed Moorhouse says the UK's reliance on importing fruit and veg is not sustainable. \"Water porosity in north Africa and in southern Spain is a key issue, extremes of temperature and the effects of climate change,\" he said. \"What we're seeking to do is, if it was tomatoes, to reshore 6-8% of tomato imports by growing in Essex.\" But the National Farmers Union says further projects like Rivenhall could be hampered by the government's new biodiversity net gain strategy, which forces all developers to benefit nature through their builds. Martin Emmett, chair of the NFU's Horticulture and Potatoes Board, says the policy was \"originally designed around housing estates, larger factories and commercial developments\". Read more:Inside Europe's biggest vertical farmWill there be a hosepipe ban in the UK? Consequently, companies may have to buy extra land to offset biodiversity impacts, which would affect similar investments across the country.

The combination may become the \"new go-to option\" for women with PIK3CA-mutated hormone receptor positive (HR+) human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 negative (HER2-) breast cancer, said the researchers. This mutation in the PIK3CA gene causes cells to divide and replicate uncontrollably.

The placebo group, which included 164 patients, was given a dummy pill plus palbociclib and fulvestrant. The median overall survival in the inavolisib group was 34 months, compared with 27 months in the placebo group. The three-drug therapy also delayed disease progression by 17.2 months, compared with 7.3 months in the placebo group, with patients also able to delay chemotherapy treatment by nearly two years longer. The combined therapy of inavolisib, palbociclib and fulvestrant is not approved in the UK. However, the combination of palbociclib and fulvestrant has been available as an option for patients with certain types of breast cancer on the NHS since 2022.  'More time before needing chemotherapy' Lead author Nick Turner, a professor of molecular oncology, said: \"The key findings from this study showed that the inavolisib-based therapy not only helped patients live longer but it more than doubled the time before their cancer progressed or worsened.\" The final results of the trial, by experts at the Institute of Cancer Research and the Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust in London, have been published in the New England Journal of Medicine and presented at the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) annual meeting in Chicago. About 55,000 women are diagnosed with breast cancer in the UK every year, some 70% of whom will have HR+, HER2- breast cancer. PIK3CA mutations are found in 35-40% of HR+ breast cancers.

        "Content": "\n          Climate reporter\n              @SeabrookClimate\n  Torrents of water that barrelled through a market town in Nigeria’s north-central state of Niger this week have now killed at least 151 people, officials said on Saturday. Heavy rain that began falling early on Thursday submerged the town of Mokwa, a major trading and transportation hub west of Abuja, where traders buy beans, onions and other food. The deluge washed away sections of roads and bridges and left some buildings almost entirely underwater. On Friday, the death count rapidly soared from 21 to more than 100. As search efforts continued on Saturday, the number climbed again to 151, spokesperson for Niger State emergency service Ibrahim Audu Husseini said. And it inflicted further misery still, injuring at least 11 and displacing more than 3,000 people, while some are still unaccounted for. Mohamed Adow, director of Kenya-based thinktank Power Shift Africa, called it a \"cruel irony\" that parts of Africa can be \"baked dry and then suffer from floods that destroy lives and livelihoods\". He told Sky News: \"The terrible floods in Nigeria are another reminder that Africa stands on the front line of the climate crisis.\" Polluting countries must \"urgently\" slash fossil fuel emissions that drive climate change and target climate funding at those who need it most, Mr Adow added. Residents have been picking their way through the wreckage and lamenting the loss of lives and livelihoods. Kazeem Muhammed said: \"We lost many lives, and the properties, our farm produce. Those that have their storage, have lost it.\" Nigerian President Bola Tinubu said he has directed the activation of the national emergency response centre to assist the state quickly. \"Search-and-rescue operations are ongoing, and all relevant federal agencies have been mobilised to support the state government's efforts,\" President Tinubu said in a late night message. \"Relief materials and temporary shelter assistance are being deployed without delay. We will ensure that no Nigerian affected by this disaster is left behind or unheard of.\" In February, the UK government announced a cut to the aid budget from 0.5% to 0.3% of gross national income from 2027, to pay for increased defence spending. It followed other cuts by the previous government, and NGOs warn countries, including Nigeria, South Sudan, and Zimbabwe, will be hit hardest. Gideon Rabinowitz, director of policy and advocacy at Bond, the UK network for NGOs, said: \"The cuts to UK aid, alongside reductions in humanitarian and development funding by countries around the world, undermine our capacity to support countries like Nigeria - those that have contributed the least to the climate crisis but are suffering its worst impacts.\" \"We urgently need an impact assessment of the UK aid cuts.\" Sky News has contacted the UK Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office for comment.

Flooding is common in Nigeria in the rainy season, which began in April. On Friday, local officials said poor infrastructure had exacerbated the recent damage, appealing for \"long overdue\" construction of waterways in the area to begin. But climate change adds an extra layer of danger. That's because hotter air can hold more moisture, so when it rains, it rains harder. Community leader Aliki Musa said Mokwa people are not used to such flooding. Heavy flooding that killed hundreds of people in Nigeria during 2022 was made at least 80 times more likely and 20% more intense by climate change, scientists at World Weather Attribution found."

        "Content": "\n          City editor\n              @MarkKleinmanSky\n Ministers are to kick off the hunt for a new chair of the communications regulator as Lord Grade of Yarmouth prepares to bow out after a single term at the helm. Sky News has learnt that the Department for Science, Innovation and Technology (DSIT) - which now leads oversight of Ofcom in Whitehall - is drawing up proposals to launch a recruitment process in the coming months. Lord Grade, the veteran broadcast executive who held senior posts at the BBC, ITV and Channel 4, has served as Ofcom chair since May 2022. His four-year term is not due to end for another 11 months, and there was no suggestion this weekend that he would leave the role ahead of that point. Insiders said, however, that there was little prospect of him seeking to be reappointed for a second term in the job. The now non-affiliated peer's appointment to the post in 2022 came after a controversial recruitment process and was signed off by Nadine Dorries, the then Tory culture secretary. Responsibility for Ofcom board appointments has switched since then from the Department for Culture, Media and Sport. \n                  TikTok's new initiative to stop teenagers' late-night doomscrolling\n                 \n                  Ofcom sets out new codes of practice to protect children online\n                 \n                  Suicide forum first to be investigated by Ofcom under new online safety laws\n                 Peter Kyle, the science secretary, authorised the recruitment of Tamara Ingram, an advertising industry stalwart, as Ofcom's deputy chair, last November.  Ofcom takes on online harms The search for a new Ofcom chair will come after a significant extension of its remit to encompass areas such as online harms. Both DCMS, which has responsibility for the media industry, and the Department for Business and Trade also have substantial engagement with Ofcom. As well as a role in appointing directors to the board of state-owned Channel 4, which is hunting both a chair and chief executive, Ofcom regulates companies such as Royal Mail, as well as the BBC. This week, the watchdog said it was pursuing action against the formerly publicly owned postal services company over its failure to hit statutory delivery targets. Ofcom also regulates the UK telecoms industry, making it one of the largest economic regulators in Britain. Data centres may be next The body may also be handed regulatory oversight of the fast-growing data centre industry. One of the tasks of Lord Grade's successor is likely to be long-term executive leadership succession planning. Dame Melanie Dawes, Ofcom's chief executive, has held the role since 2020, although there is no indication that she intends to step down in the short term. It was unclear this weekend whether any of Ofcom's existing board members might seek to take over from Lord Grade. Its slate of non-executive directors includes recently appointed Lord Allan of Hallam, a former MP, and Ben Verwaayen, the former BT Group chief executive. Mr Verwaayen is due to step down from the Ofcom board at the end of the year. The hunt for Ofcom's next chair will come amid a push led by Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer and Chancellor Rachel Reeves to shake up Britain's economic regulators as they seek ways to remove red tape from the private sector. DSIT has been contacted for comment, while Ofcom declined to comment."
