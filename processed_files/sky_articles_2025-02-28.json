        "Content": "Police say it is a \"reasonable assumption\" that actor Gene Hackman died when his pacemaker had its \"last event\" on 17 February. Hackman and his wife Betsy Arakawa were found dead in separate rooms of their home in a gated community in Santa Fe, New Mexico, on Wednesday. One of the couple's three pet dogs was also found dead near Arakawa. Their deaths were announced yesterday and an official later said the condition of the bodies indicated the pair had been dead for \"several days, possibly even up to a couple of weeks\". In an update on Friday, Santa Fe County Sheriff Adan Mendoza said information from Hackman's pacemaker appears to suggest the day he died. \"The last event [of his pacemaker] was recorded on 17 February 2025,\" he said. \"According to the pathologist, I think that is a very good assumption, that was his last day of life.\" Mr Mendoza said officials are yet to ascertain when Hackman and Arakawa's last known contact with other people was. \"That's one of our challenges because of their privacy,\" he said. \n                  What we know about Gene Hackman and wife Betsy Arakawa's deaths - and why they're 'suspicious enough' to investigate\n                 \n                  Police release 911 call of moment Gene Hackman and his wife were found dead\n                 \n                  Gene Hackman obituary: From Lex Luthor to Royal Tenenbaum, a reluctant celebrity who could turn his hand to any role\n                 Officials will \"sift through cell phones\", examine a calendar found near the couple's bodies and contact workers, family members and security staff, he added. Mr Mendoza said there were \"no apparent signs of foul play\" in the deaths of the couple following an autopsy which showed \"no external trauma\".

Police are still awaiting the full results from the autopsy and toxicology tests - which could take \"months or longer\", Mr Mendoza added. Hackman, a former Marine, appeared in more than 80 films and won two Oscars during his decades-spanning career. He met his wife, a concert pianist, in the mid-1980s and the pair married in 1991. Tributes to the couple poured in after their deaths were announced, with Prince William labelling Hackman \"a true genius of film who brought each and every character to life with power, authenticity and star quality\" in a post on X."

An isolated coughing fit, also described as a bronchial spasm, caused the 88-year-old to vomit and forced him to use an oxygen mask on his nose and mouth for the first time, the Vatican said. The Holy Father breathed in some of the vomit, leading to \"a sudden worsening of his respiratory condition\".

Doctors will need between 24 and 48 hours to understand if his overall condition has worsened because of the crisis, but they reported the Pope was \"in good spirits\". The incident contrasts with the upbeat assessment given earlier on Friday, when the Vatican said the pontiff's doctors reported he may be over the most critical phase of his pneumonia infection. It was the second day in a row where consultants avoided saying he was in a critical condition. Francis, who suffered kidney trouble last weekend, had a peaceful night on Thursday and after waking and having breakfast, he read newspapers and split the morning between prayer in the chapel and respiratory physiotherapy, the Vatican said.

Two people - a man and a woman both aged in their 20s - have been arrested over the attack and have been released on conditional bail. Initial reports suggested the dog may be an XL bully, but confirming the breed will form part of the police assessment process, according to Avon and Somerset Police. It was sedated and seized by officers. Ms Dorsett's family thanked the public for their support and those who have left flowers near the scene. Officers were called to an incident in the Hartcliffe area of Bristol at 7.19pm on Wednesday. Paramedics and police officers attended but Ms Dorsett died at the scene. On Thursday, Inspector Terry Murphy said: \"Our thoughts, first and foremost, are with the family of the young woman who's tragically died as a result of yesterday evening's incident. They have been updated and will be supported by a family liaison officer. \"I'd also like to thank the officers and paramedics who attended yesterday evening and tried to save her life.

I just can't believe it's happened and she hasn't been there that long.\" The neighbour said she had seen the dog on a lead with its owner and was certain it was an XL bully. \"I do feel so sad for the dog owner,\" she said. \"She did mention the dog wasn't great with men, fine with women and children. \"I feel for her so, so much. It wasn't her fault.\" She added: \"I genuinely feel that this was one of those freak accidents and wasn't her fault - that's how I feel.\" In February 2024 it became a criminal offence to own the XL bully breed in England and Wales without an exemption certificate. Anyone owning one of the dogs must have had the animal neutered, microchipped, and kept muzzled and on a lead in public, among other restrictions. The government move to ban the breed followed a series of attacks on people and other dogs."

        "Content": "\n          Security and Defence Editor\n              @haynesdeborah\n The Baltic states are \"very unhappy\" after the UK failed to invite their leaders to join a summit on Ukraine this weekend, a European diplomatic source has said. The source, with knowledge of the situation, warned that Moscow would notice with interest that Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia have been excluded. \"Russia and our publics will clearly assess this that we are sold out by the US, but also by [the] UK and France,\" said the source, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. Sir Keir Starmer, fresh back from a friendly meeting with Donald Trump in Washington, is due to host the leaders of more than a dozen European countries for a summit in the UK on Sunday to discuss Russia's war in Ukraine and wider European security. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, who is holding talks with the US president at the White House on Friday, is also due to attend. The diplomatic source confirmed Sir Keir would have a phone call with the leaders of the Baltic states - but signalled this was a poor substitute for not participating in the summit, which will take place in person. \"We are truly very unhappy with a refusal to invite the Baltic leaders,\" the source said. The three Baltic countries - located on NATO's eastern flank with Russia - are among the highest defence spenders in NATO as a percentage of GDP.  They are also, relative to their small size, among the biggest supporters of Ukraine - giving weapons and funding to help the Ukrainian armed forces fight off Russia's invasion - and have been the strongest voices in Europe raising the alarm about the threat posed by Russian President Vladimir Putin for years. The source said France was helping to organise the summit with Downing Street. It will be used to discuss support for Ukraine, including a plan to create an international \"reassurance\" force that could be deployed to the country to help secure a ceasefire if the US can negotiate a deal between Kyiv and Moscow. Wider European security will also be discussed after Mr Trump made clear European NATO allies need to take a much greater responsibility for their own security instead of relying on the powerful US military.

The source said members of the Baltic states \"have a plan… but [were] not invited\". \"All three Balts are among the highest supporters for Ukraine in terms of percentage of GDP and capabilities provided,\" the source said. \"All decisions directly impact our security. Like another pact to divide Europe or take us for granted. Shameful.\" The UK regards Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia as key partners. The three Baltic states are closely allied with Britain as members of the Joint Expeditionary Force, a grouping of like-minded European NATO member states. Downing Street was approached with a request for comment."

Two water cannons began spraying into the crowds who were trying to hold the line. Phalanxes of riot police, truncheons in hand, broke into a sprint from three sides, trying to catch up with the protesters as they disappeared into alleyways. Trump-Zelenskyy row latest It was perhaps inevitable the police would lose patience with the protesters who had gathered in front of the country's parliament in central Athens, throwing rocks, broken pieces of pavement and marble steps, sticks, and a lot of oranges picked from the trees that line the entrance to the building. In Greece demonstrations often go this way, even as we prepared to cover the event, we concluded some trouble would be inevitable, and we weren't wrong.  Sometimes in gas masks, sometimes in helmets, we witnessed the police take back control of Syntagma Square - the centre of a protest commemorating the second anniversary of Greece's worst train crash. A total of 57 people died, and many more were injured when two trains collided on the same line of track near the Tempi gorge in central Greece on 28 February 2023. Nobody has been held responsible, no proper investigations have been concluded, and an inquiry has found that no safety improvements have been implemented either. On social media, the victims' families called for a memorial, but the whole issue has escalated into a political crisis for the government, and the anniversary was marked with a general strike and demonstrations in dozens of cities, with hundreds of thousands taking to the street. From early morning, tens of thousands had made their way to the official start point outside parliament in Athens. They marched together, chanting \"murderers, murderers\". I spoke to two friends who had come to pay their respects to the victims. \"We are only here for justice,\" a woman in the heaving crowd told me. \"We don't trust the government about what happened.\" She added: \"I don't come here in anger, I come here in sorrow, and that is important.\" As the official rally began to disperse, the violence started as demonstrators set makeshift barricades of rubbish bins on fire and threw Molotov cocktails and rocks at police lines, attempting to hold some of Athens' famous squares. Over 5,000 riot police have been deployed, some stationary, others patrolling on motorbikes as protesters split into small groups.

In the early evening, a group of a few hundred protesters sat in front of the parliament building, watched by lines of riot police. Running battles continued into the night in other parts of the city. It's unclear what the violence has achieved, if anything, but public opinion here is hugely against the government on this issue. Many believe there has been a cover-up and there are growing calls for a parliamentary inquiry. The sense one gets is that the government needs to understand that this issue is not going away."

        "Content": "By Jason Farrell, home editor, and Liz Lane, specialist producer  Home video of Eleanor Williams shows a happy teenager; dancing, singing into a bottle, joking with her sister, and making others laugh. A marked contrast to the videos that came to define her. Warning: This article contains references to sexual abuse and violence Five years ago, police bodyworn camera footage showed a battered and drugged girl with a bleeding mouth and bruises mushrooming over her closed eye. Looking like the victim of extreme violence, she claimed on Facebook in May 2020 that she was under the control of a brutal Asian gang who sold her for sex in her hometown of Barrow-in-Furness, northwest England. But she was found guilty of perverting the course of justice. In January 2023, a jury found that she had lied, fabricated evidence and even inflicted wounds upon herself to frame innocent men. There is, however, a new twist in this murky story. 👉 Listen to the full series of Unreliable Witness on your podcast app 👈 There were Asian men grooming girls in Barrow - and at least one of those involved was linked to Eleanor's allegations. For the first time, Sky News is revealing extracts of a diary Eleanor kept in the run-up to her notorious Facebook post. And while her diary, which catalogues abuse by controlling men, may be another work of fiction, somehow within it, the girl famed for lying identifies a man who has been convicted of similar crimes. \"It's hard,\" she writes, that people think of her as a \"liar\" and \"evil and a druggy\". \"I wish I could explain everything but what's the point when they just say I'm lying,\" she adds. The girl who lied The night before the Facebook post, police found Eleanor bruised and battered in a field. \"She had horrific facial injuries,\" says her mother, Allison Johnston. \"There was blood everywhere.\" It wasn't the first time Allison had seen her daughter with unexplained injuries. Her sister, Lucy, believes Eleanor had reached breaking point and spoke about feeling ignored by the police. \"The only way I can think of it stopping is if people know what's going on,\" Lucy says Eleanor told her. Read more:How Eleanor Williams' false claims unravelledSexual abuse victims reveal impact of Eleanor Williams caseIntroducing... Unreliable Witness The Facebook post triggered a wave of protest and anger at the police. People wanted \"Justice for Ellie\". The Asian community was targeted, businesses' windows were smashed and there were more than 80 hate-related crimes linked to Eleanor's claims in the ensuing months. While no one was identified in her post, local restaurant and ice-cream van owner, Mohammed Ramzan, known as Mo Rammy, 45, was named by Eleanor to the police. When rumours started circulating about his involvement, he was left fearing for his family's safety and, he says, barely left the house for three years. \"We had fire extinguishers and baseball bats next to [the children's] beds,\" Mo says, tearfully. \"We had threats people [were] going to burn the shop down, burn us down.\" Not long after her Facebook post started going viral, it emerged that Eleanor herself was under investigation - for fabricating stories. That same day, police arrested her on suspicion of perverting the course of justice. They would later discover a hammer in the field where she was found with her injuries, which only had her DNA on it, and CCTV from Tesco would show she had bought an identical hammer days earlier. In her trial, evidence was placed before the jury that she had fabricated text messages to implicate the men. CCTV showed she had stayed in a hotel on her own for an evening in Blackpool, on a night when she'd claimed to have been raped by multiple men in Blackpool. In March 2023, she was found guilty of trying to frame five men and was jailed for eight-and-a-half years.  The other trial While most of the town was ready to move on - there was a group of local women with an ordeal ahead of them. Barrow had a secret. Another much-delayed trial involving three Asian brothers accused of grooming and sexually abusing underage girls, some as young as seven, in Barrow and Leeds was about to get under way. \"Barrow got branded a lying town,\" says Elizabeth, a key witness. \"It's not. Grooming was happening here and still probably is.\" The three men faced 62 offences between them, which were alleged to have occurred in Leeds and Barrow between 1996 and 2010. Shaha Amran Miah, 49, (Jai), was accused of 16 sexual offences against three girls, as well as two charges of intimidation and one of kidnap. Shaha Alman Miah, 47, (Ali), faced three sexual offences against one girl. Shah Joman Miah, 38, (Sarj), was accused of 40 sexual offences against three children. Nine of these were rape of a child. Elizabeth's then boyfriend worked at a takeaway called Iesha's, owned by the Miah family. It was there, she says, that girls as young as 13 or 14 were taken to so-called sex parties. \"Men came down from Leeds. I know they'd come down for one thing... sex with girls,\" she says. It was Sarj and the eldest brother Jai, she says, who regularly resorted to \"blackmail, manipulation and threats\". She told the court that Jai was a drug dealer who made threats to try to stop her giving them an interview. Elizabeth was pregnant at the time. \"I will set this house on fire with you and your partner in it and make sure that kid will never come out of you,\" Jai told her, she says. The court also heard how Sarj would take one underage girl to a hotel for sex, sneaking her in after the receptionist had left for the night. Aged in his late 20s, he began having sex with her when she was 13. A decade-and-a-half later, the court heard she still has nightmares where she sees his face. Prosecution barrister Tim Evans KC said the brothers \"created an environment in Barrow in which each of them could abuse young girls\". He described how the men used free cigarettes, food and alcohol and even paid for hair extensions as \"classic grooming\" techniques, preying on vulnerable girls who were often neglected at home. Earlier this month, all three men were found guilty of all the counts against them. Two of the brothers, Sarj and Jai, were sentenced to life in prison. Ali was given 14 years - four of those on licence. Eleanor's diary A key character in Eleanor's diary is the man now convicted of 40 counts of child abuse, Shah Joman Miah - Sarj. The diary is dated from late 2019 to early 2020. In it, Sarj is frequently named as part of a controlling network of men. In the extracts below, we've replaced the names of other men with Z. \"Monday 21 October 2019... Had Snapchats from Z saying Sarj needs me in Blackburn tomorrow, said I had to get the train to Preston because they didn't know for definite where Sarj wanted me.\" She also worries about Sarj being \"pissed off\" with her and references him being at so-called \"parties\" where men take money after she \"goes with\" certain people. Feelings of intimidation also feature. \"Tuesday 29 October 2019... Was watching out of my bedroom window and the car must have circled about three times. I got into bed and laid in the dark in silence. Had Z telling me not to piss Sarj off, Z saying I'm not to lose money.\" Sky News has digital evidence that the diary was written around the time it was dated. It wasn't public knowledge at that time that police were investigating the Miah brothers for historical crimes. Eleanor was convicted of lying about five men - Mo Rammy and four white men. But we can reveal that both Sarj and Jai's names were brought up in her trial as among those she alleged had abused her, and what's more - she was never charged with lying about them. It was suggested during her trial that diaries were all part of her fabrication, along with faked messages and self-inflicted injuries - but it is a strange coincidence that a now convicted sex offender is in there. And he is not the only one. The warnings Eleanor's mother Allison emailed police in October 2019 warning that Sarj had brought a dangerous man to Barrow, who was seen \"manhandling\" her daughter in a club and later pulling out a knife. We can't name this man for legal reasons, but two years after the email was sent, he broke into a woman's house in another town and sexually assaulted her. He was later jailed. In the extracts we have of Eleanor's diary, this man is named 36 times and is described as violent towards her. Sarj is referenced eight times. Most of the men she was convicted of lying about were not referenced in the diary in the extracts we've seen. The diary may well be an extension of the fantasy, but there is other supporting evidence that something was happening to Eleanor. Her former boss at a local pub spoke of her being intimidated by men while she was working. And her sister said she was grabbed by an Asian man in a nightclub and received threats on her phone over Snapchat. Sky News obtained a psychiatric report, which referred to a medical professional who did not believe Eleanor's injuries were self-inflicted. The forensic psychiatrist concluded she was suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder, and was likely to have been the victim of child sexual exploitation. Social service reports also reveal intimate injuries - and obvious signs of drug taking - even though the police say she was often pretending to be on drugs and that the injuries were for show. But the thing about the diary that is hard to ignore is she is naming men who would go on to be convicted of offences against other women. Sarj had allegations made against him by another teenager in Barrow, which were investigated by police in 2018, but the case ended with no further action. He was also identified by Sarah, not her real name, in Hull as having abused her from the age of 13 and selling her for sex to more than 100 men over three years. Humberside Police continue to investigate Sarah's case. \"He's not just an abuser; he's a ringleader,\" Sarah told Sky News. When it comes to Eleanor's case, she thinks the fact that Sarj \"is a guy that has abused people\" should have been looked at. Elizabeth, whose evidence against Sarj helped lead to his conviction, said: \"If I'd have known she'd [Eleanor] named him, I would have went to the police myself and said, 'why are you calling this girl a liar?'.\" 'I don't class him as human' Sarj wasn't charged until 2020. Previously, he often worked for local businessman Mo Rammy, the central figure who Eleanor was found guilty of lying about. Mo first employed Sarj back in 2012. He says he felt betrayed when he learned of his crimes. \"I don't class him as human. You've had that person with you for so many years and they've just lied to you.\" But he doesn't believe Eleanor is telling the truth about Sarj because of her lies about others including him. \"Why would you fabricate the whole story and let this one horrible filthy beast walk the streets? It doesn't make sense... I can't see how I can believe that girl.\" Cumbria Police told Sky News: \"All of Eleanor's allegations (including those emailed by her mother) were investigated thoroughly and there was no evidence of any involvement by the Miah brothers. \"This is not a case where there was not enough evidence to pursue what she was reporting but a case where allegations were proved to be lies with evidence fabricated in an attempt to support those lies, resulting in convictions for multiple offences of perverting the course of justice.\" The force says the successful conviction of the Miah brothers shows how seriously they take offences of this nature in Cumbria, and they encourage victims to come forward. We've put our allegations to solicitors representing the Miah brothers but have currently had no reply. What was going through Eleanor's mind when she posted those allegations on Facebook is still unclear. But, at least, we know what she wrote in her diary in the months before. On 17 October 2019, she wrote: \"Starting to think there's (ligit) no point in defending myself or explaining. I'll let whoever think whatever and need to be okay with my situation.\" Eleanor has now been released from prison but has not returned to Barrow. She did lie about events, and a jury found she fabricated evidence, but we now know there were other liars in this town - with other secrets.

        "Content": "Bargain Hunt auctioneer Charles Hanson has been cleared of coercive control and assault allegations relating to his wife. The 46-year-old was accused of being violent towards Rebecca Hanson over an eight-year period. The charges were brought after he was arrested in June 2023. The TV auctioneer, from Mackworth, Derby, denied controlling or coercive behaviour spanning from 2015 to 2023, assault occasioning actual bodily harm, and assault by beating. The two assault charges related to incidents in 2015 and 2023. During the trial, Hanson claimed his wife had controlled him. He told the court he was \"almost a slave\" to her, saying she left him \"a beaten and broken man\" by controlling him and making him subservient towards her. She had claimed her husband was violent towards her and put her in a headlock in 2012, while she was pregnant with a baby she later lost.

        "Headline": "After Andrew Tate and his brother Tristan arrived back on American soil, Sky News' data and forensics team reveals the online links between the Tates and Trump administration officials.",
        "Content": "By Sky News Data and Forensics Unit  On 7 November 2024, days after Donald Trump was elected president, Andrew Tate posted a prediction on X.  In response to a tweet asking what could come next, he replied: \"My case being dismissed. Watch this space 😉\". Then, on 12 February, he posted again. \"The Tates will be free, Trump is the president. The good old days are back,\" read the post. Two weeks later, on 27 February, Andrew Tate and his brother Tristan arrived at Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport from Bucharest, Romania, after a Romanian court ruled they could leave the country. The brothers had been barred from travelling for over two years over criminal investigations.  Mr Trump denies knowing about the lifted travel ban, but an analysis of links on social media shows deepening ties between Andrew Tate and several people close to the US president. The 38-year-old former kickboxer and his brother, both dual US-UK nationals who face criminal civil proceedings in Britain and the US and deny all allegations against them, haven’t been shy about their support for Mr Trump. Speaking to the media outside a courthouse in Romania in January, Tate said: \"Donald Trump is the future of the western world, everybody knows it, and everybody needs to get in line and obey him. He runs the world. He's a good friend of mine and I’m going to help him.\" Key members of the Trump administration have been vocal in their support of the alleged human trafficker and sex offender online, an alliance that experts say could benefit both sides. \"In the political climate, Tate should serve as a valuable influencer for political movements. And he's got a huge ability to mobilise large online followings, and that's a big potential political asset,\" said social media consultant Matt Navarra. \"Social media is the new battleground and influencers are the new generals and Tate is perfectly aligned to Trump's mission.\" Mr Trump himself hasn't openly spoken out in support of the Tates, and denies having any knowledge about the brothers' return to the US. \"I know nothing about that,\" he said in a press conference during a visit by UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer. But some of his closest advisors have been vocal in their support of the Tates. This includes Elon Musk, who in January responded to a video of Andrew Tate talking about running for prime minister of the UK, commenting, \"he's not wrong\". Musk was responsible for reinstating Tate’s X account after he bought the platform in 2022. Tate now has nearly 11 million followers on X. Another recent endorsement came from Alina Habba, a counselor to the president and previous legal spokesperson for Mr Trump. On 12 January this year she spoke to Tate on The Benny Show podcast – saying she was a \"big fan\" and telling him \"I got your back over here\".In response, Mr Tate replied: \"If I ever get back state side, and I think I will sooner or later, if I ever need a lawyer I’ll be calling your phone.\" But this support isn't new. The president’s son, Donald Trump Jr, has long been a fan of Andrew Tate. The two met at Trump Tower in New York in 2017, and in May 2023 he showed his support in a post on X where Tate vented about his house arrest - calling it \"absolute insanity\". Paul Ingrassia, the newly appointed White House liaison for the Department of Justice, was one of the lawyers Andrew Tate hired to fight his human trafficking case. He's often praised Tate, posting his support publicly on X.Dan Bongino, the Trump-appointed deputy director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, has promoted Tate’s account on Rumble - one of the few social video platforms where Tate isn’t banned. Now, Andrew Tate and his brother Tristan are back in Florida, after a Romanian court ruled they could leave the country. This decision came soon after Richard Grenell, a special envoy for the U.S. and a close ally of Trump, urged Romanian officials to lift travel restrictions on the brothers, according to a report by the Financial Times. Mr Grenell had spoken to Romania’s foreign minister, Emil Hurezeanu, at the Munich Security Conference earlier this month. After the Tates left Romania for Florida, Romanian Prime Minister Marcel Ciolacu denied that the country faced any pressure from the US.  The Tate brothers both face a series of criminal charges in Romania, including human trafficking, sexual misconduct and money laundering, which they deny, and are fighting a series of legal battles in the UK and the US. Mr Grenell seems aligned with some of the Tates' thinking too. At the start of February, he joined a conversation on X started by Tristan Tate. Tate mused about whether any USAID money had gone into supporting legal investigations in Romania, a thought which suggests his suspicions that American government funding was being used in the case against him. Mr Grenell weighed in, saying: \"USAID programs were weaponized against people and politicians who weren’t woke.\" But not all members of the Trump administration are pro-Tate. Some close to Trump have been vocal in their dislike of him. Sebastian Gorka, Trump’s deputy assistant and senior director for counter terrorism, has called Tate \"scum\" and a \"pervert\", and posted multiple mocking posts about him on X. Vice president JD Vance has kept relatively quiet in speaking directly about Andrew Tate. But the two have voiced similar views about women’s rights in the recent past. In a 2021 Fox News interview, Vance complained the US was being run by Democrats, corporate oligarchs and \"a bunch of childless cat ladies who are miserable at their own lives and the choices they’ve made and so they want to make the rest of the country miserable, too\". This echoes comments by Tate, who was recorded on the Fresh and Fit podcast in 2022 saying “life without children [...] is inane and it’s pointless,\" going on to say: \"If you sit here and genuinely think you’re going to work your ass off through your fertile years and by the age of 54, you’re not going to be suicidal, alone with a cat, then you are dumb.\"\"The cultural narrative is a common thread for both sides positioning themselves as defenders of traditional values,\" said Matt Navarra, the social media expert. \"Both the Tates and figures within Trump Circle often employ similar rhetorical strategies,\" he added. Mr Vance also followed both of the Tate brothers on X in December, and has been supportive of online influencers who have partnered with Tate in the past. In his first TikTok, in August last year, he was filmed with the Nelk boys, who regularly host Tate on their podcast. Reuters has reported that Andrew and Tristan plan to return to Romania at the end of March to fulfil legal obligations, but many will be watching closely to see what mark they make on America in the meantime.

Two people - a man and a woman both aged in their 20s - have been arrested over the attack and have been released on conditional bail. Initial reports suggested the dog may be an XL bully, but confirming the breed will form part of the police assessment process, according to Avon and Somerset Police. It was sedated and seized by officers. Ms Dorsett's family thanked the public for their support and those who have left flowers near the scene. Officers were called to an incident in the Hartcliffe area of Bristol at 7.19pm on Wednesday. Paramedics and police officers attended but Ms Dorsett died at the scene. On Thursday, Inspector Terry Murphy said: \"Our thoughts, first and foremost, are with the family of the young woman who's tragically died as a result of yesterday evening's incident. They have been updated and will be supported by a family liaison officer. \"I'd also like to thank the officers and paramedics who attended yesterday evening and tried to save her life.

I just can't believe it's happened and she hasn't been there that long.\" The neighbour said she had seen the dog on a lead with its owner and was certain it was an XL bully. \"I do feel so sad for the dog owner,\" she said. \"She did mention the dog wasn't great with men, fine with women and children. \"I feel for her so, so much. It wasn't her fault.\" She added: \"I genuinely feel that this was one of those freak accidents and wasn't her fault - that's how I feel.\" In February 2024 it became a criminal offence to own the XL bully breed in England and Wales without an exemption certificate. Anyone owning one of the dogs must have had the animal neutered, microchipped, and kept muzzled and on a lead in public, among other restrictions. The government move to ban the breed followed a series of attacks on people and other dogs."

The source, with knowledge of the situation, warned that Moscow would notice with interest that Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia have been excluded. \"Russia and our publics will clearly assess this that we are sold out by the US, but also by [the] UK and France,\" said the source, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. Sir Keir Starmer, fresh back from a friendly meeting with Donald Trump in Washington, is due to host the leaders of more than a dozen European countries for a summit in the UK on Sunday to discuss Russia's war in Ukraine and wider European security. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, who is holding talks with the US president at the White House on Friday, is also due to attend. The diplomatic source confirmed Sir Keir would have a phone call with the leaders of the Baltic states - but signalled this was a poor substitute for not participating in the summit, which will take place in person. \"We are truly very unhappy with a refusal to invite the Baltic leaders,\" the source said. The three Baltic countries - located on NATO's eastern flank with Russia - are among the highest defence spenders in NATO as a percentage of GDP.  They are also, relative to their small size, among the biggest supporters of Ukraine - giving weapons and funding to help the Ukrainian armed forces fight off Russia's invasion - and have been the strongest voices in Europe raising the alarm about the threat posed by Russian President Vladimir Putin for years. The source said France was helping to organise the summit with Downing Street. It will be used to discuss support for Ukraine, including a plan to create an international \"reassurance\" force that could be deployed to the country to help secure a ceasefire if the US can negotiate a deal between Kyiv and Moscow. Wider European security will also be discussed after Mr Trump made clear European NATO allies need to take a much greater responsibility for their own security instead of relying on the powerful US military.

The source said members of the Baltic states \"have a plan… but [were] not invited\". \"All three Balts are among the highest supporters for Ukraine in terms of percentage of GDP and capabilities provided,\" the source said. \"All decisions directly impact our security. Like another pact to divide Europe or take us for granted. Shameful.\" The UK regards Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia as key partners. The three Baltic states are closely allied with Britain as members of the Joint Expeditionary Force, a grouping of like-minded European NATO member states.

        "Content": " One of the men on trial over the theft of a £4.75m gold toilet from Blenheim Palace has admitted he used it the day before it was stolen, a court has been told. The fully functioning 18-carat toilet, created by Italian artist Maurizio Cattelan, had been on display at the Oxfordshire country house where Sir Winston Churchill was born. It was taken in an \"audacious\" five-minute raid in the early hours of 14 September 2019 by thieves who drove through locked gates and used sledgehammers to smash their way into the property. Michael Jones, 39, who denies burglary, told Oxford Crown Court that the artwork was \"splendid\". Two visits to palace prior to raid Jones visited the palace twice before the theft but denied that these were reconnaissance trips. He first went with his then-partner during a classic car show and the pair bought annual passes. \n                  Oxford herbicide spinout Moa seeds $40m funding round\n                 \n                  Driver Thomas Johnson jailed for killing three teenage passengers after inhaling laughing gas at the wheel\n                 \n                  Rapper Slowthai cleared of raping two women during house party\n                 Photographs taken included a poster advertising the upcoming gold toilet exhibition and the window that would later be smashed in the theft, the court heard. But Jones said it was a shot of Union flags in the distance, and denied he was trying to help any burglars. Jones 'spent 90 minutes at palace' The day before the toilet was stolen, Jones and the same woman spent around 90 minutes at the palace on what was a Friday, the trial heard. Asked by prosecutors why he had taken a half-day off work rather than waiting until the weekend, he admitted it was unusual for him, but \"was interested to go and see it\". Questioned if he \"took advantage of\" the gold toilet's \"facilities\", the defendant said yes, and described it as \"splendid\".

Jones, from Oxford, said he did not know Guccuk or Doe before the case began but had worked as a roofer and builder for Sheen from around 2018 and was, in effect, his 'right-hand man'. The toilet artwork, entitled America, weighed approximately 98kg, was insured for $6m (£4.75m) and was made from gold worth about £2.8m. It is believed to have been broken up after it was stolen. The thieves drove through locked, wooden gates into the grounds of the palace before breaking in through a window. The trial continues."

        "Content": "By Jason Farrell, home editor, and Liz Lane, specialist producer  Home video of Eleanor Williams shows a happy teenager; dancing, singing into a bottle, joking with her sister, and making others laugh. A marked contrast to the videos that came to define her. Warning: This article contains references to sexual abuse and violence Five years ago, police bodyworn camera footage showed a battered and drugged girl with a bleeding mouth and bruises mushrooming over her closed eye. Looking like the victim of extreme violence, she claimed on Facebook in May 2020 that she was under the control of a brutal Asian gang who sold her for sex in her hometown of Barrow-in-Furness, northwest England. But she was found guilty of perverting the course of justice. In January 2023, a jury found that she had lied, fabricated evidence and even inflicted wounds upon herself to frame innocent men. There is, however, a new twist in this murky story. 👉 Listen to the full series of Unreliable Witness on your podcast app 👈 There were Asian men grooming girls in Barrow - and at least one of those involved was linked to Eleanor's allegations. For the first time, Sky News is revealing extracts of a diary Eleanor kept in the run-up to her notorious Facebook post. And while her diary, which catalogues abuse by controlling men, may be another work of fiction, somehow within it, the girl famed for lying identifies a man who has been convicted of similar crimes. \"It's hard,\" she writes, that people think of her as a \"liar\" and \"evil and a druggy\". \"I wish I could explain everything but what's the point when they just say I'm lying,\" she adds. The girl who lied The night before the Facebook post, police found Eleanor bruised and battered in a field. \"She had horrific facial injuries,\" says her mother, Allison Johnston. \"There was blood everywhere.\" It wasn't the first time Allison had seen her daughter with unexplained injuries. Her sister, Lucy, believes Eleanor had reached breaking point and spoke about feeling ignored by the police. \"The only way I can think of it stopping is if people know what's going on,\" Lucy says Eleanor told her.

Unreliable Witness The Facebook post triggered a wave of protest and anger at the police. People wanted \"Justice for Ellie\". The Asian community was targeted, businesses' windows were smashed and there were more than 80 hate-related crimes linked to Eleanor's claims in the ensuing months. While no one was identified in her post, local restaurant and ice-cream van owner, Mohammed Ramzan, known as Mo Rammy, 45, was named by Eleanor to the police. When rumours started circulating about his involvement, he was left fearing for his family's safety and, he says, barely left the house for three years. \"We had fire extinguishers and baseball bats next to [the children's] beds,\" Mo says, tearfully. \"We had threats people [were] going to burn the shop down, burn us down.\" Not long after her Facebook post started going viral, it emerged that Eleanor herself was under investigation - for fabricating stories. That same day, police arrested her on suspicion of perverting the course of justice. They would later discover a hammer in the field where she was found with her injuries, which only had her DNA on it, and CCTV from Tesco would show she had bought an identical hammer days earlier. In her trial, evidence was placed before the jury that she had fabricated text messages to implicate the men. CCTV showed she had stayed in a hotel on her own for an evening in Blackpool, on a night when she'd claimed to have been raped by multiple men in Blackpool. In March 2023, she was found guilty of trying to frame five men and was jailed for eight-and-a-half years.  The other trial While most of the town was ready to move on - there was a group of local women with an ordeal ahead of them. Barrow had a secret. Another much-delayed trial involving three Asian brothers accused of grooming and sexually abusing underage girls, some as young as seven, in Barrow and Leeds was about to get under way. \"Barrow got branded a lying town,\" says Elizabeth, a key witness. \"It's not. Grooming was happening here and still probably is.\" The three men faced 62 offences between them, which were alleged to have occurred in Leeds and Barrow between 1996 and 2010. Shaha Amran Miah, 49, (Jai), was accused of 16 sexual offences against three girls, as well as two charges of intimidation and one of kidnap. Shaha Alman Miah, 47, (Ali), faced three sexual offences against one girl. Shah Joman Miah, 38, (Sarj), was accused of 40 sexual offences against three children. Nine of these were rape of a child. Elizabeth's then boyfriend worked at a takeaway called Iesha's, owned by the Miah family. It was there, she says, that girls as young as 13 or 14 were taken to so-called sex parties. \"Men came down from Leeds. I know they'd come down for one thing... sex with girls,\" she says. It was Sarj and the eldest brother Jai, she says, who regularly resorted to \"blackmail, manipulation and threats\". She told the court that Jai was a drug dealer who made threats to try to stop her giving them an interview. Elizabeth was pregnant at the time. \"I will set this house on fire with you and your partner in it and make sure that kid will never come out of you,\" Jai told her, she says. The court also heard how Sarj would take one underage girl to a hotel for sex, sneaking her in after the receptionist had left for the night. Aged in his late 20s, he began having sex with her when she was 13. A decade-and-a-half later, the court heard she still has nightmares where she sees his face. Prosecution barrister Tim Evans KC said the brothers \"created an environment in Barrow in which each of them could abuse young girls\". He described how the men used free cigarettes, food and alcohol and even paid for hair extensions as \"classic grooming\" techniques, preying on vulnerable girls who were often neglected at home. Earlier this month, all three men were found guilty of all the counts against them. Two of the brothers, Sarj and Jai, were sentenced to life in prison. Ali was given 14 years - four of those on licence. Eleanor's diary A key character in Eleanor's diary is the man now convicted of 40 counts of child abuse, Shah Joman Miah - Sarj. The diary is dated from late 2019 to early 2020. In it, Sarj is frequently named as part of a controlling network of men. In the extracts below, we've replaced the names of other men with Z. \"Monday 21 October 2019... Had Snapchats from Z saying Sarj needs me in Blackburn tomorrow, said I had to get the train to Preston because they didn't know for definite where Sarj wanted me.\" She also worries about Sarj being \"pissed off\" with her and references him being at so-called \"parties\" where men take money after she \"goes with\" certain people. Feelings of intimidation also feature. \"Tuesday 29 October 2019... Was watching out of my bedroom window and the car must have circled about three times. I got into bed and laid in the dark in silence. Had Z telling me not to piss Sarj off, Z saying I'm not to lose money.\" Sky News has digital evidence that the diary was written around the time it was dated. It wasn't public knowledge at that time that police were investigating the Miah brothers for historical crimes. Eleanor was convicted of lying about five men - Mo Rammy and four white men. But we can reveal that both Sarj and Jai's names were brought up in her trial as among those she alleged had abused her, and what's more - she was never charged with lying about them. It was suggested during her trial that diaries were all part of her fabrication, along with faked messages and self-inflicted injuries - but it is a strange coincidence that a now convicted sex offender is in there. And he is not the only one. The warnings Eleanor's mother Allison emailed police in October 2019 warning that Sarj had brought a dangerous man to Barrow, who was seen \"manhandling\" her daughter in a club and later pulling out a knife. We can't name this man for legal reasons, but two years after the email was sent, he broke into a woman's house in another town and sexually assaulted her. He was later jailed. In the extracts we have of Eleanor's diary, this man is named 36 times and is described as violent towards her. Sarj is referenced eight times. Most of the men she was convicted of lying about were not referenced in the diary in the extracts we've seen. The diary may well be an extension of the fantasy, but there is other supporting evidence that something was happening to Eleanor. Her former boss at a local pub spoke of her being intimidated by men while she was working. And her sister said she was grabbed by an Asian man in a nightclub and received threats on her phone over Snapchat. Sky News obtained a psychiatric report, which referred to a medical professional who did not believe Eleanor's injuries were self-inflicted. The forensic psychiatrist concluded she was suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder, and was likely to have been the victim of child sexual exploitation. Social service reports also reveal intimate injuries - and obvious signs of drug taking - even though the police say she was often pretending to be on drugs and that the injuries were for show. But the thing about the diary that is hard to ignore is she is naming men who would go on to be convicted of offences against other women. Sarj had allegations made against him by another teenager in Barrow, which were investigated by police in 2018, but the case ended with no further action. He was also identified by Sarah, not her real name, in Hull as having abused her from the age of 13 and selling her for sex to more than 100 men over three years. Humberside Police continue to investigate Sarah's case. \"He's not just an abuser; he's a ringleader,\" Sarah told Sky News. When it comes to Eleanor's case, she thinks the fact that Sarj \"is a guy that has abused people\" should have been looked at. Elizabeth, whose evidence against Sarj helped lead to his conviction, said: \"If I'd have known she'd [Eleanor] named him, I would have went to the police myself and said, 'why are you calling this girl a liar?'.\" 'I don't class him as human' Sarj wasn't charged until 2020. Previously, he often worked for local businessman Mo Rammy, the central figure who Eleanor was found guilty of lying about. Mo first employed Sarj back in 2012. He says he felt betrayed when he learned of his crimes. \"I don't class him as human. You've had that person with you for so many years and they've just lied to you.\" But he doesn't believe Eleanor is telling the truth about Sarj because of her lies about others including him. \"Why would you fabricate the whole story and let this one horrible filthy beast walk the streets? It doesn't make sense... I can't see how I can believe that girl.\" Cumbria Police told Sky News: \"All of Eleanor's allegations (including those emailed by her mother) were investigated thoroughly and there was no evidence of any involvement by the Miah brothers. \"This is not a case where there was not enough evidence to pursue what she was reporting but a case where allegations were proved to be lies with evidence fabricated in an attempt to support those lies, resulting in convictions for multiple offences of perverting the course of justice.\" The force says the successful conviction of the Miah brothers shows how seriously they take offences of this nature in Cumbria, and they encourage victims to come forward. We've put our allegations to solicitors representing the Miah brothers but have currently had no reply. What was going through Eleanor's mind when she posted those allegations on Facebook is still unclear. But, at least, we know what she wrote in her diary in the months before. On 17 October 2019, she wrote: \"Starting to think there's (ligit) no point in defending myself or explaining. I'll let whoever think whatever and need to be okay with my situation.\" Eleanor has now been released from prison but has not returned to Barrow. She did lie about events, and a jury found she fabricated evidence, but we now know there were other liars in this town - with other secrets.

Bhim Kohli was shoved to the ground and slapped in the face with a shoe by a boy wearing a balaclava, a trial at Leicester Crown Court heard. The grandfather had walked a short distance from his home to Franklin Park in Braunstone Town, near Leicester, when he was attacked on 1 September last year, the court heard. Mr Kohli died in hospital the next day after suffering fractured ribs and a spinal cord injury. A 15-year-old boy is on trial charged with one count of murder and an alternative charge of manslaughter. A 13-year-old girl is charged with Mr Kohli's manslaughter. Neither child can be named because of their ages and both deny the charges against them. Victim's daughter - 'My dad screamed' On the fourth day of the trial, a written statement from Mr Kohli's daughter Susan Kohli recounted the aftermath of the attack in the park. \"Whilst by his side, I knelt down and said, 'Dad, what has happened?'. He screamed, 'My neck. my neck, my neck, lift my neck',\" the statement said. \"This was not his normal tone. He was in agony, almost screaming. I have never heard him cry out in pain about anything like that before.\" A second statement from Ms Kohli said: \"While we were on Franklin Park my dad told me that they had called him a P***.\" Read more from Sky News:Baltic states 'very unhappy' after UK fails to invite leaders to Ukraine summitBargain Hunt auctioneer cleared of coercive control and assault allegationsMinister resigns over cut to international aid budget Simranjeet Kohli, Mr Kohli's grandson, who was in the park in the aftermath of the attack, said in a statement: \"My granddad was yelling in pain as he was laying there.\" Jurors heard an account of the alleged attack, detailed in a police report by officers who had heard from a witness. According to the report, she described \"seeing the boy forcefully pushing the old man on to his back\". The jury heard the witness described the old man as \"ending up on the floor screaming\". A statement from PC Rachelle Pereira said: \"Mr Kohli was repeatedly screaming out in pain, shouting out 'My neck'.\" Her statement said the witness told the police officer she saw a young white boy wearing a black balaclava \"shove the old man to the floor and sprint\".

        "Content": "\n          Business and economics reporter\n              @SkyNewsBiz\n The banking sector is \"investing heavily\" in digital platforms, according to the body which represents the country's lenders as many face a backlash over the latest payday glitch chaos to hit customers. Millions were exposed on Friday to varying challenges from slow app or online banking performance to being blocked out of their accounts altogether. Users said the brands that had encountered issues - which did not appear to be related - included Lloyds, Halifax, Nationwide, TSB, Bank of Scotland and First Direct. Money latest: How is my bank affected by banking glitch? It marked the second month in a row for payday problems and no reasons have been given for the disruption. The industry has been historically reluctant to talk about common challenges in digital banking provision but its mouthpiece, UK Finance, told Sky News there was help available and protections in place during times of disruption while acknowledging customer frustrations. The body spoke up as MPs and regulators take a greater interest in the resilience issue due to mounting concerns over the number of glitches. \n                  Money blog: Microsoft 'retiring' Skype later this year - and telling users to switch\n                 \n                  Kick It Out chair Bhandari shortlisted to head new football regulator\n                 \n                  Microsoft is shutting down Skype: What other technologies have become obsolete?\n                  All this comes at a time when major lenders face criticism for continuing to cut branch services at a regular pace - blaming ever higher demand for online services. The UK's big banking brands have been shutting branches since the fallout from the financial crisis in 2008, which sparked a rush to cut costs. The uptake of digital banking services has seen more than 6,200 sites go to the wall since 2015, according to the consumer group Which? The latest closures were revealed last month by Lloyds - Britain's biggest mortgage lender. Its announcements meant that it planned, across the group, to have just 386 Lloyds-branded branches left, with Halifax down to 281. Bank of Scotland would have just 90 once the closure programme was completed. Critics have long accused the industry of failing to sufficiently invest their branch closure savings in better online services. But a UK Finance spokesperson said: \"All banks invest heavily in their systems and technology to ensure customers have easy access to banking services. \"Where issues arise, they work extremely hard to rectify them quickly and to support their customers. \"Banks have been posting information on their websites and social media accounts to ensure they keep customers updated.\" Read more from Sky News:Donald Trump opens door to US-UK 'real trade deal'Trump's China tariff escalation spooks global marketsCouncil finances 'becoming unsustainable' Are banks doing enough? Earlier this month, The Treasury committee of MPs wrote to bank bosses to request information on the scale and impact of IT failures over the past two years. Their responses should have been received by Wednesday. It followed an outage at Barclays which led to some customers being unable to access some services for up to three days from 31 January. The day marked HMRC's self-assessment deadline alongside payday. The Bank of England has also been taking a greater interest in the issue for financial stability reasons. The MPs sought data from the banks on the volumes of customers affected by glitches - and the compensation that had been offered. Committee chair, Dame Meg Hillier, said then: \"When a bank's IT system goes down, it can be a real problem for our constituents who were relying on accessing certain services so they can buy food or pay bills. \"For it to happen at a major bank such as Barclays at such a crucial time of year is either bad luck or bad planning. Either way, it's important to learn what has happened and what will be done about it. \"The rapidly declining number of high street bank branches makes the impact of IT outages even more painful; that's why I've decided to write to some of our biggest banks and building societies.\""

Security and Defence Editor The fiery and very public bust-up between Donald Trump and Volodymyr Zelenskyy is a disaster for Ukraine and its European allies, and a triumph for Russia.  The spectacle of the US president berating his Ukrainian counterpart and telling him he is gambling with World War Three – played out on television from the Oval Office – was hard to witness.  Zelenskyy, looking increasingly uncomfortable, decided to fight back. He likely felt he had little choice but to defend himself and his war-torn country.  But this act of defiance drew even more condemnation from Trump as well as from JD Vance, who also started attacking the Ukrainian leader.  It is hard to imagine a greater contrast from the chummy scenes between Sir Keir Starmer and Trump and the scolding language used by the American president against Zelenskyy, at times addressing him as though he were a naughty schoolboy.  Ukraine's president, his arms crossed, tried his best to speak up, but he was clearly fighting a losing battle. The extraordinary breakdown is far more serious than just a made-for-television drama.  American support for Ukraine is critical if Kyiv is to withstand Russia's war. The UK, France and Ukraine's other European allies have been working overtime to try to keep Trump on their side.  The US president has vowed to end the war and has started talks with Vladimir Putin. The two presidents also plan to meet. That alone was hard for Ukraine to witness.  But the Ukrainian side has attempted to work with Washington rather than against it, including by being willing to part with profits from its minerals and other natural resources in return for locking Trump into a long-term partnership with Ukraine.  That all looks to be shattered – or at best is in serious jeopardy.  If Trump, in anger, withdraws all his military support to Ukraine, Kyiv's ability to withstand Russia's military will be seriously diminished.  The Europeans lack the capability to fill the void. The only person who wins in this scenario is Vladimir Putin. Posting on his Truth Social platform shortly after the clash, Mr Trump described the meeting as \"very meaningful\" and said: \"Much was learned that could never be understood without conversation under such fire and pressure. \"It's amazing what comes out through emotion, and I have determined that President Zelenskyy is not ready for Peace if America is involved, because he feels our involvement gives him a big advantage in negotiations.\" More from Sky News:How Starmer secured wins at the White HouseInside the Oval Office with Trump and Starmer He continued: \"I don't want advantage, I want PEACE.

You're in no position to dictate what we're going to feel.\" Ukraine latest: Trump says Zelenskyy disrespected US and can come back when he's ready for peace Here is a look at what Sky News' correspondents thought of the extraordinary exchange. Dominic Waghorn, international affairs correspondent European leaders will be looking at tonight's spectacle in the White House in horror. Their approach has been to look on the bright side and hope wooing and flattering Donald Trump will bring him round on Ukraine. Only those in the room will know for sure, but from where the rest of us were sitting, this looked very much like a deliberate ambush, led by the vice president JD Vance. The Oval Office was reduced to a reality TV show. It seemed like the kind of orchestrated pile-on only Jerry Springer or Jeremy Kyle could be proud of. More from Sky News:How Starmer secured wins at the White HouseInside the Oval Office with Trump and Starmer If that is the conclusion of European allies, their choice is stark. Rise to the moment, accept America has become a rogue, unreliable ally under Mr Trump and do what they can to protect Ukraine, or watch themselves and Ukraine be picked apart by greater powers. It is a moment of destiny for Europe that Sir Keir Starmer, Emmanuel Macron and others have been putting off arguably for too long, unwilling to accept their transatlantic partner cannot be trusted. It must be repeated that neither Mr Trump nor Mr Vance have yet uttered a word of criticism for Vladimir Putin. They seem to like and respect him as do their cohorts on the far right of American politics. If that is the case Ukraine now has only Europe to rely on. Is Europe up to the challenge? David Blevins, Sky correspondent, in Washington Donald Trump said it would make \"great television\". It certainly didn't make for great diplomacy. Quite the opposite. The gulf between the United States and Ukraine laid bare on camera around the globe. The niceties in the Oval Office came to an abrupt end when Mr Trump said he wasn't aligned with either Ukraine or Russia.  Volodymyr Zelenskyy questioned how diplomacy would work when Vladimir Putin \"breaks ceasefires\". Vice president JD Vance accused him of being \"disrespectful\" by trying \"to litigate this in front of the American media\". It went from bad to worse when Mr Zelenskyy replied: \"You have a nice ocean and don't feel now, but you will feel it in the future.\" Mr Trump retorted: \"Don't tell us what we're going to feel… you're in no position to dictate that. \"You don't have the cards right now… you're gambling with the lives of millions of people… you're gambling with World War Three… and what you're doing is very disrespectful to this country.\" You could have cut the atmosphere in the West Wing with a knife as the back-and-forth continued for several minutes. It brings the flurry of diplomatic activity in Washington this week to a disastrous conclusion. The French president had flattered Trump with words, the UK prime minister stepping up the charm offensive with a letter of invitation from the King. But Mr Zelenskyy, who looked like a man with the world on his shoulders, had chosen not to ignore the elephant in the room. Instead, he continued to demand security guarantees from the United States as part of any ceasefire. The hostile words culminated in a moment unprecedented in living memory - the Ukrainian president leaving the White House and being told not to return until he's ready to make peace. Ivor Bennett, Moscow correspondent Like everywhere else, Moscow will have watched this exchange open-mouthed - stunned by its implications. But while jaws will still be on the floor in Europe, here in Russia they're already grinning from ear to ear, because it really couldn't have gone any better for the Kremlin. Not only was Volodymyr Zelenskyy publicly humiliated by the leader of the nation on which Ukraine's future depends, the attack read like a script written by Vladimir Putin.  The Ukrainian leader was accused of \"forcing conscripts to the frontline\", of taking foreign leaders on a \"propaganda tour\" and even \"gambling with World War Three\". They are phrases one hears on Russian state media on an almost daily basis. Under the Biden administration, that kind of language was aimed at Mr Putin, but this was an illustration of how Mr Trump has turned everything on its head and Russia's president is the beneficiary. When it was Emmanuel Macron and Sir Keir Starmer in the White House earlier this week, there was a sense of anxiety coming from the Kremlin. On both occasions, Mr Putin felt the need to make public overtures towards Washington, as if to remind Donald Trump of what Russia has to offer, betraying a fear that he may be vulnerable to the other side of the argument. Well there's definitely no anxiety now - instead Moscow appears to be gloating. \"Historic,\" was the one-word reaction from Kirill Dmitriev, the Harvard-educated head of Russia's sovereign wealth fund, who was in Riyadh last week for the first meeting between Russian and US officials. And the reaction from Russian foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova hinted at how Russia might use this going forward. \"It's a miracle of restraint how Trump and Vance restrained themselves and didn't punch this scumbag,\" she wrote on Telegram, full of flattery. Expect Moscow to dial up the charm offensive, giving Mr Trump the \"respect\" he accused Mr Zelenskyy of lacking. The aim will be to make tonight's spat a permanent separation.

Kyiv's 'shattered' attempt to work with Washington The US president has vowed to end the war and has started talks with Vladimir Putin. The two presidents also plan to meet. That alone was hard for Kyiv to stomach. But the Ukrainian government has attempted to work with Washington rather than against it, including by being willing to part with profits from its minerals and other natural resources in return for locking Mr Trump into a long-term partnership with Ukraine. That now all looks to be shattered - or at best in serious jeopardy.  If Mr Trump, in anger, withdraws all his military support to Ukraine, Kyiv's ability to endure Russia's invasion will be seriously diminished. The Europeans lack the capability to fill the void. The only person who wins in this scenario is Mr Putin. Europe's strategy for Zelenskyy Given all that was at stake, Mr Zelenskyy was doubtless counselled by European allies to resist rising to any insults hurled at him by the Trump team before he boarded his flight to Washington. Only last week, Mr Trump himself called the Ukrainian leader a \"dictator\" - and suggested Kyiv was to blame for the war. However, the hostile onslaught in the Oval Office was clearly too much to take. It was triggered by JD Vance who goaded the Ukrainian leader for not showing thanks to the American people for all the military support - even though Mr Zelenskyy always makes a point of expressing gratitude. The Ukrainian president tried to stand up for himself but this triggered Mr Trump to turn on him as well, addressing him as though he were a naughty school boy. Mr Zelenskyy's efforts to defend himself were widely applauded by his fellow Ukrainians back home as well as some close allies, but it was a move that he may come to regret if it makes future dealings with the White House impossible - an outcome that unfortunately would be very dangerous for Ukraine. One Western source told me that Mr Zelenskyy \"could have played it better\", but the source noted that the president's country is at war - signalling that it is hardly surprising he felt the need to defend himself and Ukraine. The row will doubtless be played back with glee inside the Kremlin. Major victory for Moscow Russia will view this public meltdown in US-Ukraine ties at the highest level as a major victory and it will doubtless spur a doubling down of attacks by Russian forces along the frontline as they try to push their advantage. For Ukraine's president he will surely be asking himself whether he could have handled the encounter more diplomatically. 👉Listen to The World with Richard Engel and Yalda Hakim on your podcast app👈 He already seems to be trying to mend fences, posting on social media after being asked to leave the White House, to say a very clear \"thank you\" to the American people and their president. It is hard to imagine a greater contrast between the public mauling of Mr Zelenskyy by Mr Trump and the chummy display of friendship the American president bestowed on the visiting British Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer barely 24 hours earlier. It makes a summit of European leaders, including Mr Zelenskyy, the UK is hosting on Ukraine on Sunday all the more critical.

        "Content": "\n          Business and economics reporter\n              @SkyNewsBiz\n Donald Trump's threats of additional trade tariffs against China, on top of the 10% hike imposed earlier this month, have contributed to a widespread stock market sell-off. Sentiment was already sour on the tariff front, given the spectre of 25% import duties being slapped on the EU, before the US president confirmed his intention to target Canada, Mexico and China next week. Mr Trump said his proposed 25% tariffs on Mexican and Canadian goods - delayed by a month - would take effect on 4 March as planned, alongside an extra 10% duty on Chinese imports. Money latest: Pocket money for kids varies by area Beijing's reaction was to threaten further retaliation, building on the market fears the Trump administration was risking a deepening global trade war. The mood was already sour in the US on Thursday when a tech sell-off linked to poorly received results from Nvidia knocked almost 2.7% from the Nasdaq.

In Europe, the DAX in Germany and French CAC were on course to build on declines seen on Thursday, with the manufacturing-heavy DAX losing just shy of 1% at the open. The UK may have been spared Trump tariff threats - and even promised renewed trade talks during Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer's meeting at the White House on Thursday - but the FTSE 100 was still feeling some pain. A decline of 0.4% was registered in early trading though it later entered positive territory, aided by some strong corporate earnings including full-year results for British Airways parent firm IAG. Read more: Trump opens door to US-UK trade dealThe effects of Trump trade tariffs explained The main fear among investors is damage to the global economy from a widening and protracted trade fight as Mr Trump battles to secure American jobs through the imposition of tariffs. But one consequence of higher import costs due to the duties is the fact they risk stoking US inflation, as costs are passed on. Brent crude oil was down by almost 1% to trade at $73 a barrel. Cryptocurrencies took the largest hammering. Bitcoin was 27% below its record high set in January at $79,740 and down by 6% on the day.  Mr Trump told reporters in the Oval Office he decided to add the extra tariffs on China and stick to the deadline for Canada and Mexico because of what his administration sees as insufficient progress on curbing fentanyl flows into the country. \"There are ongoing discussions with the Chinese, Mexico and Canada,\" a White House official told the Reuters news agency. \"We've gotten a good handle on the migration issue, but there are still concerns on the other issue of fentanyl deaths.\" It was a narrative that was firmly rejected by China's foreign ministry. A spokesperson said China would take all necessary measures to firmly safeguard its legitimate interest. \"The US is once again using the fentanyl issue as a pretext to threaten China\", Lin Jian told a regular news conference. Commenting on the downbeat market mood, Derren Nathan, head of equity research at Hargreaves Lansdown, said:\"The only certainty in this saga is uncertainty, so keep a close eye on developments between now and 4 March. \"Next on the agenda is reciprocal tariffs pencilled in for 2 April with other major US trading partners. The EU, in particular, will be in focus. \"An amicable start to talks with UK premier Keir Starmer looks to have set the tone for a potential trade deal with the UK but with no details outlined it has not been enough to boost enthusiasm for London listed shares.\""

The US leader has been lavished with praise by the head of football's world governing body, which has been reciprocated in speeches in recent weeks highlighting upcoming FIFA events in the United States. After attending a speech in Miami last week, where Mr Trump claimed Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy was a \"dictator\", Mr Infantino praised him for promoting a message of \"peace and unity\". Arriving in Northern Ireland for meetings on Friday night, Mr Infantino opened the door to Russia's eventual return from a FIFA ban by saying: \"We want to have all the countries playing.\" Mr Infantino declined to discuss the US president banning diversity, equity and inclusion which are often promoted as central missions to FIFA. But he was more willing to justify spending so much time with Mr Trump - pointing to the new 32-team men's Club World Cup being in the US this summer and the expanded 48-country men's World Cup in 2026. \"I think it is absolutely crucial for the success of a World Cup to have a close relationship with the president,\" Mr Infantino said in Hollywood, Northern Ireland. \n                  British man who works for FIFA arrested on suspicion of having sex with underage boy in US\n                 \n                  How did Saudi Arabia land the 2034 World Cup?   \n                 \n                  Saudi Arabia confirmed as hosts for 2034 World Cup\n                 Transgender debate in sport One of Mr Trump's central sports policies is ordering sports to not allow transgender women to compete in women's sport - threatening to block visas. FIFA has not followed sports, including athletics and swimming, in adopting the same ban, saying for two years that a review of the gender eligibility policy is ongoing. When Sky News asked about the issue on Friday night, Mr Infantino was dragged off by a member of his media team to check into his hotel ahead of meetings of the International Football Association Board. Read more from Sky News:Trump berates Zelenskyy in Oval OfficeMourinho sues Galatasaray This was a rare chance to question Mr Infantino, who has not held a news conference in the last year, and the first chance to discuss the contentious process that saw Saudi Arabia awarded the 2034 World Cup in December last year. Mr Infantino was asked about Saudi Arabia not being a democracy and discriminatory laws counter to FIFA's statutes, including criminalising same-sex relations. The 211 football associations were unable to express any dissent in the unopposed contest with a vote replaced by an approval by acclamation.  'We bring the world together' Mr Infantino said: \"There was a congress decision, uniting the entire world. I think it was a very positive step for football, bringing, in eight years, football all over the world, hosting everyone. \"Football is the game of everyone. Everyone loves football. It's the number one sport in the world. \"We have to be bringing everyone on the table. We will go to North America, now we go to South America, go to Africa, we'll go to Europe [for the 2030 World Cup]. \"We'll go back to Asia [for 2034]. The FIFA Congress approved that. It was done after an in-depth report on all this. We unite the world. \"We bring the world together and we make sure that football is played everywhere, and football is loved everywhere. \"We give opportunities to people, for people to meet each other and to come together.\" Russian return? Mr Infantino is hoping for Russia's eventual return to football after being banned following the full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022. But he said there had been no request from Mr Trump, who has pursued a peace deal with Vladimir Putin that has largely cut out Ukraine. \"We all hope that peace talks will be successful, because I think it is important that we support it for the world, much more than for football, that we have peace,\" Mr Infantino said. \"If there is a little role that football can play, once peace is there, then of course, we'll play our role, and we look forward that all countries in the world can play football.\""

The incident took place near a highway in the state of Uttarakhand's Chamoli region where workers were engaged in road construction. Local police said at least 57 workers were initially buried under snow. Of those, 16 have been rescued so far, senior police officer Rajeev Swaroop said. Five of them are in a serious condition and have been taken to a military facility for treatment, according to Sky's India reporter Neville Lazarus. He says the Indian army is taking part in the rescue operation, with about 150 soldiers on site alongside the national disaster response force and state disaster response force. However, local officials say the operation is being hampered by adverse weather conditions. \"Currently, the rescue operation is slow because we are facing difficulties in movement due to active rainfall,\" Chamoli district magistrate Sandeep Tiwari said. \"As soon as the weather gets better, we will fast-track the rescue operation.\" He said there are currently no reports of any casualties. Local media had earlier reported that people were trapped after a \"glacier burst\", before authorities confirmed it was an avalanche.

        "Content": " Greek police have fired tear gas at demonstrators throwing petrol bombs after a protest marking the anniversary of the country's worst-ever train crash turned violent. Scores of hooded youths hurled Molotov cocktails, smashed paving stones and attempted to storm the barricades in front of parliament during clashes with police in central Athens. Riot police responded with volleys of tear gas and stun grenades. Sky's chief correspondent Stuart Ramsay, who is in Athens, has said \"huge crowds\" have been out on the streets throughout the capital today, and there had been a \"sense\" that demonstrations could turn violent.  Hundreds of thousands of people have been taking part in rallies across the country to demand justice two years after the deadly crash. \"You count profits. We count lives,\" protesters chanted, while some carried black balloons and anti-government banners. Fifty-seven people were killed when a passenger train filled with university students collided with a freight train in Tempe in 2023. The crash has become a symbol of institutional failure in the country. Protests are being held in dozens of towns and cities across Greece as part of a general strike which has grounded flights and halted sea and train transport. International and domestic flights were grounded as air traffic controllers joined the strike. Seafarers, train drivers, doctors, lawyers and teachers are also taking part, with businesses and shops across the country shut. The demonstrations have been led by the relatives of the 57 people killed and are among the largest since the country's debt crisis more than a decade ago. \"The government hasn't done anything to get justice,\" said Christos Main, 57, a musician at the Athens rally. \"This wasn't an accident, it was murder.\" Read more from Sky News:At least 41 trapped after avalanche in Indian HimalayasVolcano owners' conviction over deadly eruption overturned Yannis Panagopoulos, president of the General Confederation of Greek Workers, the country's largest labour union, which has backed the strike, said: \"The full truth must come to light, and those responsible, no matter how high their position, must be held accountable.\" The demonstrations have been fuelled by resentment over the conservative government's perceived inaction after the crash exposed deficiencies in the country's transportation infrastructure. A long-awaited report on the investigation into the crash released on Thursday concluded that human error, outdated infrastructure and major systemic failures were to blame. It also found safety gaps that caused the crash have not been filled. A separate judicial investigation remains unfinished. Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis's government has faced criticism from relatives of the victims for failing to initiate a parliamentary inquiry into political responsibility. The government denies wrongdoing and says it is up to the judiciary to investigate."

        "Content": "A freed Israeli hostage has described how ropes that tied his hands together \"tore into flesh\", and said he suffered \"impossible\" hunger while in Hamas captivity. Eli Sharabi, 53, was released by Hamas on 8 February after being taken hostage from his home in Kibbutz Be'eri during the 7 October 2023 attack. Images of Mr Sharabi after his release from Gaza show him looking gaunt and weak, which shocked and angered Israel. As Mr Sharabi was paraded on stage by Hamas before his release, he said he was looking forward to being reunited with his British wife Lianne and teenage daughters Noiya and Yahel - but only found out they were killed on 7 October after he reached Israel. Mr Sharabi lost more than 30kg (66lbs) while held hostage and received one bowl of pasta a day, he told Israeli TV's Channel 12. \"[It was] a tenth of what I need. If it happens for a day or two it is not that terrible [but] that's the amount we ate for six months, every day. When you ask for something more, and suddenly someone throws you a dry date, it seems like the best meal in the world to you,\" he said. \"You feel your gut stuck to your spine, but you can see your gut actually go inward at some point, and you can't believe that's what's happening to your body.\" \n                  Hamas releases bodies of last hostages included in first phase of ceasefire - as hundreds of Palestinian prisoners are freed\n                 \n                  Brother of former hostage Eli Sharabi says he was tortured and starved while captive in Gaza\n                 \n                  Supporters mourn charismatic leader Hassan Nasrallah - with Hezbollah left in crisis\n                 Mr Sharabi was held in ropes and iron chains and sometimes beaten or humiliated by Hamas militants during his captivity, he said. \"During the first three days, my hands are tied behind my back, my legs are tied, with ropes that tear into your flesh. \"I remember not being able to fall asleep because of the pain. The ropes are already digging into your flesh, and every movement makes you want to scream. \"Your hands are also tied behind your back, so your shoulders really, really hurt - and no position is good enough. \"There are moments you just pass out, lose consciousness. You wake up after two or three hours and the pain continues.\" Mr Sharabi said he decided to speak out about his 16 months in Gaza because \"we really must not leave anyone behind\". \"I remember every minute in the tunnel, how we would say, 'maybe today, maybe today'. A kid I met 14 months ago, after 50 days in Gaza, is still there,\" he said, referring to 24-year-old Alon Ohel, whom he became close with in captivity. \"The day I leave, the terrorists tear me away from him. He just refuses to let go, he held on to me. It was a very tough moment.\" \"He said he was happy for me. I promised him I wouldn't leave him there, that I'd fight for him.\"  More from Sky News:Trump shares bizarre AI video of vision for GazaProbe reveals IDF failures in October 7 attackWest Bank 'turning into mini Gaza' A ceasefire, which was brokered by the US, Egypt and Qatar, ended 15 months of violence in Gaza after Hamas' 7 October attack that killed some 1,200 people in Israel. The militants took about 250 people hostage. Israel's military offensive has killed over 48,000 Palestinians, according to Palestinian health officials, displaced an estimated 90% of Gaza's population and destroyed the territory's infrastructure and health system. The Hamas-run health ministry does not differentiate between civilian and militant deaths, but it says that over half of the dead have been women and children. Hamas has returned 33 hostages, including eight bodies, in exchange for nearly 2,000 Palestinian prisoners as part of a ceasefire in Gaza. Negotiations between Israel and Hamas on the next phase of the Gaza ceasefire began on Thursday, Egypt said, averting a collapse ahead of Saturday's expiration of the agreement's first phase. Talks on the second phase are meant to negotiate an end to the war, including the return of all remaining living hostages in Gaza, and the withdrawal of all Israeli troops from the territory. The return of remaining deceased hostages would happen in the third phase."

        "Content": " Donald Trump and JD Vance held a heated meeting with Volodymyr Zelenskyy in front of the media – which saw the US president tell his Ukrainian counterpart he is \"gambling with World War Three\".  Mr Zelenskyy travelled to the US as he attempted to secure a ceasefire agreement with Russia and a possible mineral deal with the United States. But his visit to the White House ended prematurely - with the signing of an agreement and a joint press conference with Mr Trump called off following their Oval Office clash. Ukraine latest: Russian official responds to White House meeting As the pair met with US vice president JD Vance joining them, tensions rose and a shouting match unfolded - all while cameras rolled and representatives from the media looked on. The last 10 minutes of the almost 45-minute meeting descended into a tense back-and-forth, which began with Mr Vance telling Mr Zelenksyy: \"I think it's disrespectful for you to come to the Oval Office to try to litigate this in front of the American media. \"You should be thanking the President [Trump] for trying to bring an end to this conflict.\" \n                  Trump-Zelenskyy row is triumph for Russia - and makes UK summit of European leaders all the more critical\n                 \n                  Trump-Zelenskyy clash: Sky News correspondents' views\n                 \n                  Will ministerial resignation dent Starmer's post-Trump high?\n                 As the Ukrainian president tried to object, Mr Trump raised his voice and told him: \"You're gambling with the lives of millions of people. \"You're gambling with World War Three, and what you're doing is very disrespectful to the country, this country that's backed you far more than a lot of people say they should have.\" \"You're right now not in a very good position,\" he continued. \"You don't have the cards right now with us, you start having problems right now.\"  'This will be great television,' says Trump  At one point, Mr Vance blasted Mr Zelenskyy for airing \"disagreements\" in front of the press, but the US president remarked: \"I think it's good for the American people to see what's going on.\" \"You're not acting at all thankful,\" he said. \"This is going to be great television.\" Defending himself and his country, the Ukrainian president openly challenged Mr Trump on his softer approach to Vladimir Putin and urged him to make \"no compromises with a killer\". Security and Defence Editor The fiery and very public bust-up between Donald Trump and Volodymyr Zelenskyy is a disaster for Ukraine and its European allies, and a triumph for Russia.  The spectacle of the US president berating his Ukrainian counterpart and telling him he is gambling with World War Three – played out on television from the Oval Office – was hard to witness.  Zelenskyy, looking increasingly uncomfortable, decided to fight back. He likely felt he had little choice but to defend himself and his war-torn country.  But this act of defiance drew even more condemnation from Trump as well as from JD Vance, who also started attacking the Ukrainian leader.  It is hard to imagine a greater contrast from the chummy scenes between Sir Keir Starmer and Trump and the scolding language used by the American president against Zelenskyy, at times addressing him as though he were a naughty schoolboy.  Ukraine's president, his arms crossed, tried his best to speak up, but he was clearly fighting a losing battle. The extraordinary breakdown is far more serious than just a made-for-television drama.  American support for Ukraine is critical if Kyiv is to withstand Russia's war. The UK, France and Ukraine's other European allies have been working overtime to try to keep Trump on their side.  The US president has vowed to end the war and has started talks with Vladimir Putin. The two presidents also plan to meet. That alone was hard for Ukraine to witness.  But the Ukrainian side has attempted to work with Washington rather than against it, including by being willing to part with profits from its minerals and other natural resources in return for locking Trump into a long-term partnership with Ukraine.  That all looks to be shattered – or at best is in serious jeopardy.  If Trump, in anger, withdraws all his military support to Ukraine, Kyiv's ability to withstand Russia's military will be seriously diminished.  The Europeans lack the capability to fill the void. The only person who wins in this scenario is Vladimir Putin. Posting on his Truth Social platform shortly after the clash, Mr Trump described the meeting as \"very meaningful\" and said: \"Much was learned that could never be understood without conversation under such fire and pressure. \"It's amazing what comes out through emotion, and I have determined that President Zelenskyy is not ready for Peace if America is involved, because he feels our involvement gives him a big advantage in negotiations.\" More from Sky News:How Starmer secured wins at the White HouseInside the Oval Office with Trump and Starmer He continued: \"I don't want advantage, I want PEACE. He disrespected the United States of America in its cherished Oval Office.

Ukraine needs just and lasting peace, and we are working exactly for that.\""

        "Content": "Police say it is a \"reasonable assumption\" that actor Gene Hackman died when his pacemaker had its \"last event\" on 17 February. Hackman and his wife Betsy Arakawa were found dead in separate rooms of their home in a gated community in Santa Fe, New Mexico, on Wednesday. One of the couple's three pet dogs was also found dead near Arakawa. Their deaths were announced yesterday and an official later said the condition of the bodies indicated the pair had been dead for \"several days, possibly even up to a couple of weeks\". In an update on Friday, Santa Fe County Sheriff Adan Mendoza said information from Hackman's pacemaker appears to suggest the day he died. \"The last event [of his pacemaker] was recorded on 17 February 2025,\" he said. \"According to the pathologist, I think that is a very good assumption, that was his last day of life.\" Mr Mendoza said officials are yet to ascertain when Hackman and Arakawa's last known contact with other people was. \"That's one of our challenges because of their privacy,\" he said. \n                  What we know about Gene Hackman and wife Betsy Arakawa's deaths - and why they're 'suspicious enough' to investigate\n                 \n                  Police release 911 call of moment Gene Hackman and his wife were found dead\n                 \n                  Gene Hackman obituary: From Lex Luthor to Royal Tenenbaum, a reluctant celebrity who could turn his hand to any role\n                 Officials will \"sift through cell phones\", examine a calendar found near the couple's bodies and contact workers, family members and security staff, he added.

Police are still awaiting the full results from the autopsy and toxicology tests - which could take \"months or longer\", Mr Mendoza added. Hackman, a former Marine, appeared in more than 80 films and won two Oscars during his decades-spanning career. He met his wife, a concert pianist, in the mid-1980s and the pair married in 1991. Tributes to the couple poured in after their deaths were announced, with Prince William labelling Hackman \"a true genius of film who brought each and every character to life with power, authenticity and star quality\" in a post on X."

Dominic Waghorn, international affairs correspondent European leaders will be looking at tonight's spectacle in the White House in horror. Their approach has been to look on the bright side and hope wooing and flattering Donald Trump will bring him round on Ukraine. Only those in the room will know for sure, but from where the rest of us were sitting, this looked very much like a deliberate ambush, led by the vice president JD Vance. The Oval Office was reduced to a reality TV show. It seemed like the kind of orchestrated pile-on only Jerry Springer or Jeremy Kyle could be proud of. More from Sky News:How Starmer secured wins at the White HouseInside the Oval Office with Trump and Starmer If that is the conclusion of European allies, their choice is stark. Rise to the moment, accept America has become a rogue, unreliable ally under Mr Trump and do what they can to protect Ukraine, or watch themselves and Ukraine be picked apart by greater powers. It is a moment of destiny for Europe that Sir Keir Starmer, Emmanuel Macron and others have been putting off arguably for too long, unwilling to accept their transatlantic partner cannot be trusted. It must be repeated that neither Mr Trump nor Mr Vance have yet uttered a word of criticism for Vladimir Putin. They seem to like and respect him as do their cohorts on the far right of American politics. If that is the case Ukraine now has only Europe to rely on. Is Europe up to the challenge? David Blevins, Sky correspondent, in Washington Donald Trump said it would make \"great television\". It certainly didn't make for great diplomacy. Quite the opposite. The gulf between the United States and Ukraine laid bare on camera around the globe. The niceties in the Oval Office came to an abrupt end when Mr Trump said he wasn't aligned with either Ukraine or Russia.  Volodymyr Zelenskyy questioned how diplomacy would work when Vladimir Putin \"breaks ceasefires\". Vice president JD Vance accused him of being \"disrespectful\" by trying \"to litigate this in front of the American media\". It went from bad to worse when Mr Zelenskyy replied: \"You have a nice ocean and don't feel now, but you will feel it in the future.\" Mr Trump retorted: \"Don't tell us what we're going to feel… you're in no position to dictate that. \"You don't have the cards right now… you're gambling with the lives of millions of people… you're gambling with World War Three… and what you're doing is very disrespectful to this country.\" You could have cut the atmosphere in the West Wing with a knife as the back-and-forth continued for several minutes. It brings the flurry of diplomatic activity in Washington this week to a disastrous conclusion. The French president had flattered Trump with words, the UK prime minister stepping up the charm offensive with a letter of invitation from the King. But Mr Zelenskyy, who looked like a man with the world on his shoulders, had chosen not to ignore the elephant in the room. Instead, he continued to demand security guarantees from the United States as part of any ceasefire. The hostile words culminated in a moment unprecedented in living memory - the Ukrainian president leaving the White House and being told not to return until he's ready to make peace. Ivor Bennett, Moscow correspondent Like everywhere else, Moscow will have watched this exchange open-mouthed - stunned by its implications. But while jaws will still be on the floor in Europe, here in Russia they're already grinning from ear to ear, because it really couldn't have gone any better for the Kremlin. Not only was Volodymyr Zelenskyy publicly humiliated by the leader of the nation on which Ukraine's future depends, the attack read like a script written by Vladimir Putin.  The Ukrainian leader was accused of \"forcing conscripts to the frontline\", of taking foreign leaders on a \"propaganda tour\" and even \"gambling with World War Three\". They are phrases one hears on Russian state media on an almost daily basis. Under the Biden administration, that kind of language was aimed at Mr Putin, but this was an illustration of how Mr Trump has turned everything on its head and Russia's president is the beneficiary. When it was Emmanuel Macron and Sir Keir Starmer in the White House earlier this week, there was a sense of anxiety coming from the Kremlin. On both occasions, Mr Putin felt the need to make public overtures towards Washington, as if to remind Donald Trump of what Russia has to offer, betraying a fear that he may be vulnerable to the other side of the argument. Well there's definitely no anxiety now - instead Moscow appears to be gloating. \"Historic,\" was the one-word reaction from Kirill Dmitriev, the Harvard-educated head of Russia's sovereign wealth fund, who was in Riyadh last week for the first meeting between Russian and US officials. And the reaction from Russian foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova hinted at how Russia might use this going forward. \"It's a miracle of restraint how Trump and Vance restrained themselves and didn't punch this scumbag,\" she wrote on Telegram, full of flattery. Expect Moscow to dial up the charm offensive, giving Mr Trump the \"respect\" he accused Mr Zelenskyy of lacking. The aim will be to make tonight's spat a permanent separation.

American support for Ukraine is critical if Kyiv is to withstand Russia's war. \n                  Trump-Zelenskyy clash: Sky News correspondents' views\n                 \n                  Will ministerial resignation dent Starmer's post-Trump high?\n                 \n                  Donald Trump tells Volodymyr Zelenskyy 'you're gambling with World War Three' in fiery Oval Office meeting\n                 The UK, France and Ukraine's other European allies have been working overtime to try to keep Mr Trump on side. Kyiv's 'shattered' attempt to work with Washington The US president has vowed to end the war and has started talks with Vladimir Putin. The two presidents also plan to meet. That alone was hard for Kyiv to stomach. But the Ukrainian government has attempted to work with Washington rather than against it, including by being willing to part with profits from its minerals and other natural resources in return for locking Mr Trump into a long-term partnership with Ukraine. That now all looks to be shattered - or at best in serious jeopardy.  If Mr Trump, in anger, withdraws all his military support to Ukraine, Kyiv's ability to endure Russia's invasion will be seriously diminished. The Europeans lack the capability to fill the void. The only person who wins in this scenario is Mr Putin. Europe's strategy for Zelenskyy Given all that was at stake, Mr Zelenskyy was doubtless counselled by European allies to resist rising to any insults hurled at him by the Trump team before he boarded his flight to Washington. Only last week, Mr Trump himself called the Ukrainian leader a \"dictator\" - and suggested Kyiv was to blame for the war. However, the hostile onslaught in the Oval Office was clearly too much to take. It was triggered by JD Vance who goaded the Ukrainian leader for not showing thanks to the American people for all the military support - even though Mr Zelenskyy always makes a point of expressing gratitude. The Ukrainian president tried to stand up for himself but this triggered Mr Trump to turn on him as well, addressing him as though he were a naughty school boy. Mr Zelenskyy's efforts to defend himself were widely applauded by his fellow Ukrainians back home as well as some close allies, but it was a move that he may come to regret if it makes future dealings with the White House impossible - an outcome that unfortunately would be very dangerous for Ukraine. One Western source told me that Mr Zelenskyy \"could have played it better\", but the source noted that the president's country is at war - signalling that it is hardly surprising he felt the need to defend himself and Ukraine. The row will doubtless be played back with glee inside the Kremlin. Major victory for Moscow Russia will view this public meltdown in US-Ukraine ties at the highest level as a major victory and it will doubtless spur a doubling down of attacks by Russian forces along the frontline as they try to push their advantage. For Ukraine's president he will surely be asking himself whether he could have handled the encounter more diplomatically. 👉Listen to The World with Richard Engel and Yalda Hakim on your podcast app👈 He already seems to be trying to mend fences, posting on social media after being asked to leave the White House, to say a very clear \"thank you\" to the American people and their president. It is hard to imagine a greater contrast between the public mauling of Mr Zelenskyy by Mr Trump and the chummy display of friendship the American president bestowed on the visiting British Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer barely 24 hours earlier. It makes a summit of European leaders, including Mr Zelenskyy, the UK is hosting on Ukraine on Sunday all the more critical.

        "Content": "\n          Business and economics reporter\n              @SkyNewsBiz\n Donald Trump's threats of additional trade tariffs against China, on top of the 10% hike imposed earlier this month, have contributed to a widespread stock market sell-off. Sentiment was already sour on the tariff front, given the spectre of 25% import duties being slapped on the EU, before the US president confirmed his intention to target Canada, Mexico and China next week. Mr Trump said his proposed 25% tariffs on Mexican and Canadian goods - delayed by a month - would take effect on 4 March as planned, alongside an extra 10% duty on Chinese imports. Money latest: Pocket money for kids varies by area Beijing's reaction was to threaten further retaliation, building on the market fears the Trump administration was risking a deepening global trade war. The mood was already sour in the US on Thursday when a tech sell-off linked to poorly received results from Nvidia knocked almost 2.7% from the Nasdaq. Tech shares were among those hammered as the focus switched to Asia on Friday morning though trades were increasingly dominated by trade war concerns. \n                  Money blog: Microsoft 'retiring' Skype later this year - and telling users to switch\n                 \n                  Banks 'investing heavily' in digital platforms as payday glitch chaos strikes again \n                 \n                  Kick It Out chair Bhandari shortlisted to head new football regulator\n                 The Hang Seng in Hong Kong fell more than 3%, while Japan's Nikkei slumped to a five-month low as demand soared for the safe haven yen. In Europe, the DAX in Germany and French CAC were on course to build on declines seen on Thursday, with the manufacturing-heavy DAX losing just shy of 1% at the open. The UK may have been spared Trump tariff threats - and even promised renewed trade talks during Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer's meeting at the White House on Thursday - but the FTSE 100 was still feeling some pain. A decline of 0.4% was registered in early trading though it later entered positive territory, aided by some strong corporate earnings including full-year results for British Airways parent firm IAG. Read more: Trump opens door to US-UK trade dealThe effects of Trump trade tariffs explained The main fear among investors is damage to the global economy from a widening and protracted trade fight as Mr Trump battles to secure American jobs through the imposition of tariffs. But one consequence of higher import costs due to the duties is the fact they risk stoking US inflation, as costs are passed on. Brent crude oil was down by almost 1% to trade at $73 a barrel. Cryptocurrencies took the largest hammering. Bitcoin was 27% below its record high set in January at $79,740 and down by 6% on the day.  Mr Trump told reporters in the Oval Office he decided to add the extra tariffs on China and stick to the deadline for Canada and Mexico because of what his administration sees as insufficient progress on curbing fentanyl flows into the country. \"There are ongoing discussions with the Chinese, Mexico and Canada,\" a White House official told the Reuters news agency. \"We've gotten a good handle on the migration issue, but there are still concerns on the other issue of fentanyl deaths.\" It was a narrative that was firmly rejected by China's foreign ministry. A spokesperson said China would take all necessary measures to firmly safeguard its legitimate interest. \"The US is once again using the fentanyl issue as a pretext to threaten China\", Lin Jian told a regular news conference. Commenting on the downbeat market mood, Derren Nathan, head of equity research at Hargreaves Lansdown, said:\"The only certainty in this saga is uncertainty, so keep a close eye on developments between now and 4 March. \"Next on the agenda is reciprocal tariffs pencilled in for 2 April with other major US trading partners. The EU, in particular, will be in focus. \"An amicable start to talks with UK premier Keir Starmer looks to have set the tone for a potential trade deal with the UK but with no details outlined it has not been enough to boost enthusiasm for London listed shares.\""

        "Content": "\n          Sports correspondent\n              @RobHarris\n  FIFA president Gianni Infantino has defended his controversial alliance with Donald Trump as \"critical\" for the success of the World Cup. The US leader has been lavished with praise by the head of football's world governing body, which has been reciprocated in speeches in recent weeks highlighting upcoming FIFA events in the United States. After attending a speech in Miami last week, where Mr Trump claimed Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy was a \"dictator\", Mr Infantino praised him for promoting a message of \"peace and unity\". Arriving in Northern Ireland for meetings on Friday night, Mr Infantino opened the door to Russia's eventual return from a FIFA ban by saying: \"We want to have all the countries playing.\" Mr Infantino declined to discuss the US president banning diversity, equity and inclusion which are often promoted as central missions to FIFA. But he was more willing to justify spending so much time with Mr Trump - pointing to the new 32-team men's Club World Cup being in the US this summer and the expanded 48-country men's World Cup in 2026. \"I think it is absolutely crucial for the success of a World Cup to have a close relationship with the president,\" Mr Infantino said in Hollywood, Northern Ireland. \n                  British man who works for FIFA arrested on suspicion of having sex with underage boy in US\n                 \n                  How did Saudi Arabia land the 2034 World Cup?   \n                 \n                  Saudi Arabia confirmed as hosts for 2034 World Cup\n                 Transgender debate in sport One of Mr Trump's central sports policies is ordering sports to not allow transgender women to compete in women's sport - threatening to block visas. FIFA has not followed sports, including athletics and swimming, in adopting the same ban, saying for two years that a review of the gender eligibility policy is ongoing. When Sky News asked about the issue on Friday night, Mr Infantino was dragged off by a member of his media team to check into his hotel ahead of meetings of the International Football Association Board. Read more from Sky News:Trump berates Zelenskyy in Oval OfficeMourinho sues Galatasaray This was a rare chance to question Mr Infantino, who has not held a news conference in the last year, and the first chance to discuss the contentious process that saw Saudi Arabia awarded the 2034 World Cup in December last year. Mr Infantino was asked about Saudi Arabia not being a democracy and discriminatory laws counter to FIFA's statutes, including criminalising same-sex relations. The 211 football associations were unable to express any dissent in the unopposed contest with a vote replaced by an approval by acclamation.  'We bring the world together' Mr Infantino said: \"There was a congress decision, uniting the entire world. I think it was a very positive step for football, bringing, in eight years, football all over the world, hosting everyone. \"Football is the game of everyone. Everyone loves football. It's the number one sport in the world. \"We have to be bringing everyone on the table. We will go to North America, now we go to South America, go to Africa, we'll go to Europe [for the 2030 World Cup]. \"We'll go back to Asia [for 2034]. The FIFA Congress approved that. It was done after an in-depth report on all this. We unite the world. \"We bring the world together and we make sure that football is played everywhere, and football is loved everywhere. \"We give opportunities to people, for people to meet each other and to come together.\" Russian return? Mr Infantino is hoping for Russia's eventual return to football after being banned following the full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022. But he said there had been no request from Mr Trump, who has pursued a peace deal with Vladimir Putin that has largely cut out Ukraine. \"We all hope that peace talks will be successful, because I think it is important that we support it for the world, much more than for football, that we have peace,\" Mr Infantino said. \"If there is a little role that football can play, once peace is there, then of course, we'll play our role, and we look forward that all countries in the world can play football.\""

        "Headline": "After Andrew Tate and his brother Tristan arrived back on American soil, Sky News' data and forensics team reveals the online links between the Tates and Trump administration officials.",
        "Content": "By Sky News Data and Forensics Unit  On 7 November 2024, days after Donald Trump was elected president, Andrew Tate posted a prediction on X.  In response to a tweet asking what could come next, he replied: \"My case being dismissed. Watch this space 😉\". Then, on 12 February, he posted again. \"The Tates will be free, Trump is the president. The good old days are back,\" read the post. Two weeks later, on 27 February, Andrew Tate and his brother Tristan arrived at Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport from Bucharest, Romania, after a Romanian court ruled they could leave the country. The brothers had been barred from travelling for over two years over criminal investigations.  Mr Trump denies knowing about the lifted travel ban, but an analysis of links on social media shows deepening ties between Andrew Tate and several people close to the US president. The 38-year-old former kickboxer and his brother, both dual US-UK nationals who face criminal civil proceedings in Britain and the US and deny all allegations against them, haven’t been shy about their support for Mr Trump. Speaking to the media outside a courthouse in Romania in January, Tate said: \"Donald Trump is the future of the western world, everybody knows it, and everybody needs to get in line and obey him. He runs the world. He's a good friend of mine and I’m going to help him.\" Key members of the Trump administration have been vocal in their support of the alleged human trafficker and sex offender online, an alliance that experts say could benefit both sides. \"In the political climate, Tate should serve as a valuable influencer for political movements. And he's got a huge ability to mobilise large online followings, and that's a big potential political asset,\" said social media consultant Matt Navarra. \"Social media is the new battleground and influencers are the new generals and Tate is perfectly aligned to Trump's mission.\" Mr Trump himself hasn't openly spoken out in support of the Tates, and denies having any knowledge about the brothers' return to the US. \"I know nothing about that,\" he said in a press conference during a visit by UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer. But some of his closest advisors have been vocal in their support of the Tates. This includes Elon Musk, who in January responded to a video of Andrew Tate talking about running for prime minister of the UK, commenting, \"he's not wrong\". Musk was responsible for reinstating Tate’s X account after he bought the platform in 2022. Tate now has nearly 11 million followers on X. Another recent endorsement came from Alina Habba, a counselor to the president and previous legal spokesperson for Mr Trump. On 12 January this year she spoke to Tate on The Benny Show podcast – saying she was a \"big fan\" and telling him \"I got your back over here\".In response, Mr Tate replied: \"If I ever get back state side, and I think I will sooner or later, if I ever need a lawyer I’ll be calling your phone.\" But this support isn't new. The president’s son, Donald Trump Jr, has long been a fan of Andrew Tate. The two met at Trump Tower in New York in 2017, and in May 2023 he showed his support in a post on X where Tate vented about his house arrest - calling it \"absolute insanity\". Paul Ingrassia, the newly appointed White House liaison for the Department of Justice, was one of the lawyers Andrew Tate hired to fight his human trafficking case. He's often praised Tate, posting his support publicly on X.Dan Bongino, the Trump-appointed deputy director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, has promoted Tate’s account on Rumble - one of the few social video platforms where Tate isn’t banned. Now, Andrew Tate and his brother Tristan are back in Florida, after a Romanian court ruled they could leave the country. This decision came soon after Richard Grenell, a special envoy for the U.S. and a close ally of Trump, urged Romanian officials to lift travel restrictions on the brothers, according to a report by the Financial Times. Mr Grenell had spoken to Romania’s foreign minister, Emil Hurezeanu, at the Munich Security Conference earlier this month. After the Tates left Romania for Florida, Romanian Prime Minister Marcel Ciolacu denied that the country faced any pressure from the US.  The Tate brothers both face a series of criminal charges in Romania, including human trafficking, sexual misconduct and money laundering, which they deny, and are fighting a series of legal battles in the UK and the US. Mr Grenell seems aligned with some of the Tates' thinking too. At the start of February, he joined a conversation on X started by Tristan Tate. Tate mused about whether any USAID money had gone into supporting legal investigations in Romania, a thought which suggests his suspicions that American government funding was being used in the case against him. Mr Grenell weighed in, saying: \"USAID programs were weaponized against people and politicians who weren’t woke.\" But not all members of the Trump administration are pro-Tate. Some close to Trump have been vocal in their dislike of him. Sebastian Gorka, Trump’s deputy assistant and senior director for counter terrorism, has called Tate \"scum\" and a \"pervert\", and posted multiple mocking posts about him on X. Vice president JD Vance has kept relatively quiet in speaking directly about Andrew Tate. But the two have voiced similar views about women’s rights in the recent past. In a 2021 Fox News interview, Vance complained the US was being run by Democrats, corporate oligarchs and \"a bunch of childless cat ladies who are miserable at their own lives and the choices they’ve made and so they want to make the rest of the country miserable, too\". This echoes comments by Tate, who was recorded on the Fresh and Fit podcast in 2022 saying “life without children [...] is inane and it’s pointless,\" going on to say: \"If you sit here and genuinely think you’re going to work your ass off through your fertile years and by the age of 54, you’re not going to be suicidal, alone with a cat, then you are dumb.\"\"The cultural narrative is a common thread for both sides positioning themselves as defenders of traditional values,\" said Matt Navarra, the social media expert. \"Both the Tates and figures within Trump Circle often employ similar rhetorical strategies,\" he added. Mr Vance also followed both of the Tate brothers on X in December, and has been supportive of online influencers who have partnered with Tate in the past. In his first TikTok, in August last year, he was filmed with the Nelk boys, who regularly host Tate on their podcast. Reuters has reported that Andrew and Tristan plan to return to Romania at the end of March to fulfil legal obligations, but many will be watching closely to see what mark they make on America in the meantime.

        "Content": "Microsoft has announced it will shut down Skype, once the dominant video call service, in May this year. At its peak, the service boasted more than 300 million users, but that number had fallen to more than 36 million users, according to the most recent figures shared by Microsoft in 2023. The US tech giant, which bought Skype for $8.5bn in 2011, will shift some of its services to Microsoft Teams, its flagship videoconferencing and team applications platform. Skype users will be able to use their existing accounts to log into Teams. From Blackberries to floppy disks and MP3 players, Sky News looks at other pieces of software and hardware that were once ubiquitous but are now obsolete. Dumb phones Smartphones have replaced old-fashioned mobile phones, which were much more limited in features. They could only make and receive calls and texts, though some could play games like Snake. \n                  Banks 'investing heavily' in digital platforms as payday glitch chaos strikes again \n                 \n                  Dozens arrested worldwide over AI-generated child sexual abuse images\n                 \n                  Wild beavers to make a comeback in England after government approves reintroduction\n                 The devices have seen somewhat of a resurgence among people wanting to limit their mobile phone use. Blackberries Blackberries revolutionised typing on mobile phones by including a full keyboard. They were widely used for business communication including email and messaging services. But they were made obsolete by smartphones which transformed the physical keyboard onto the touchscreen. Landlines The first telephone call was made in 1876 and the device has gone through various iterations in the years since. Once commonplace in homes and offices, the wired landline has seen its use decline amid the rise of mobile phones. Floppy disks While data used to be stored on floppy disks, they were later replaced by CD-ROMs and now live on as the save icon for most software. They became increasingly smaller since their appearance in the 1970s. However, they were vulnerable to magnets and heat, which could damage their data. VHS VHS cassette tapes became the standard way to watch films at home from the late 1980s. They had to be rewound at the end of every film, which could be time-consuming. The release of DVDs began the slow decline of the VHS and eventually replaced it. Cassette tapes Cassette tapes were the main way people could listen to and record music from the 1960s. They were also used to store data for early home computers. But by the 90s they were outsold by CDs, which later killed them off. CDs and DVDs CDs and DVDs in turn would follow VHS and cassettes in becoming obsolete in a world of online streaming. The convenience and accessibility of streaming services drove the shift towards digital media, and people often now pay for subscription services rather than individual albums or films. The Walkman and MP3 players Portable music players like the Walkman and MP3 players have also become victims of the rise of the smartphone. Smartphones with integrated music apps and streaming services made separate music players mostly redundant. Pagers Pagers once let people know someone was trying to contact them, but they would have to head to a landline or phone booth to call them back. Mobile phones offered instant communication, making pagers obsolete. Smartphones further revolutionised communication by offering video calls and internet access for instant messaging. Fax machines Fax machines in offices were used to send and receive documents, especially those requiring signatures. They could also be used to send confidential information securely over phone lines. But they were replaced by emails and instant messaging services. Overhead projectors Schools and offices used overhead projectors to project documents onto a screen for everyone to see. Teachers and professionals could use them to display annotated notes and diagrams. They were made obsolete by modern projectors and computers."

Official results of post-mortem examinations and toxicology reports are pending, and the manner and cause of death have not yet been determined, according to the sheriff's office. Hackman's daughter had earlier suggested the couple may have been killed by carbon monoxide - but the cause of death remains unclear. The local utility company tested gas lines in and around the home after the bodies were found and did not find any sign of problems, the police warrant said. A fire bridge official later confirmed that they \"did not find anything in the home\" relating to a gas leak or carbon monoxide poisoning but said a leak could have dissipated. Tributes poured in for Hackman, who won an Oscar for his lead role in The French Connection, a 1971 action movie by William Friedkin, and another for best supporting actor in Clint Eastwood's 1992 western, Unforgiven. He was also known for playing Lex Luthor in the Superman films of the late 1970s and 1980s. Roles in the Francis Ford Coppola mystery thriller The Conversation and in the historical drama Mississippi Burning, where he starred as an FBI agent alongside Willem Dafoe, helped cement his career as one of Hollywood's greats. Among those paying tribute was the Prince of Wales, who said he was \"so sad to hear the news\". \"Hackman was a true genius of film who brought each and every character to life with power, authenticity and star quality,\" he said in a post on X. The Shawshank Redemption actor Morgan Freeman said \"bringing the French film Garde a Vue (Under Suspicion) to life with the incredibly gifted Gene Hackman\" was \"one of the personal highlights of my career\". The thriller, released in 2000, saw Hackman play wealthy tax lawyer Henry Hearst who is questioned by Freeman's character, Captain Victor Beneze, about the murder of a young girl. American filmmaker Francis Ford Coppola hailed Hackman as a \"great actor\" who was \"inspiring and magnificent in his work and complexity\". Coppola wrote and directed the Oscar-nominated 1974 mystery thriller The Conversation, which starred Hackman as a surveillance expert who has a crisis of conscience when he suspects the couple he is spying on will be murdered. Bill Murray, who starred with Hackman in the 2001 film The Tenenbaums, called him a \"tough nut\" and a \"really good\" actor.  Singer Sting said the world had \"lost a legend\" while actor and director Clint Eastwood said Hackman would be \"deeply missed\". Dirty Harry actor Eastwood starred opposite Hackman in 1997 political action thriller Absolute Power, where he played master jewel thief Luther Whitney. Hackman married Arakawa, a classical pianist, in 1991. He had three children, Christopher, Elizabeth Jean and Leslie Anne, with his late ex-wife, Faye Maltese, who died in 2017."

        "Content": "\n          Business and economics reporter\n              @SkyNewsBiz\n The banking sector is \"investing heavily\" in digital platforms, according to the body which represents the country's lenders as many face a backlash over the latest payday glitch chaos to hit customers. Millions were exposed on Friday to varying challenges from slow app or online banking performance to being blocked out of their accounts altogether. Users said the brands that had encountered issues - which did not appear to be related - included Lloyds, Halifax, Nationwide, TSB, Bank of Scotland and First Direct. Money latest: How is my bank affected by banking glitch? It marked the second month in a row for payday problems and no reasons have been given for the disruption. The industry has been historically reluctant to talk about common challenges in digital banking provision but its mouthpiece, UK Finance, told Sky News there was help available and protections in place during times of disruption while acknowledging customer frustrations. The body spoke up as MPs and regulators take a greater interest in the resilience issue due to mounting concerns over the number of glitches. \n                  Money blog: Microsoft 'retiring' Skype later this year - and telling users to switch\n                 \n                  Kick It Out chair Bhandari shortlisted to head new football regulator\n                 \n                  Microsoft is shutting down Skype: What other technologies have become obsolete?\n                  All this comes at a time when major lenders face criticism for continuing to cut branch services at a regular pace - blaming ever higher demand for online services. The UK's big banking brands have been shutting branches since the fallout from the financial crisis in 2008, which sparked a rush to cut costs. The uptake of digital banking services has seen more than 6,200 sites go to the wall since 2015, according to the consumer group Which? The latest closures were revealed last month by Lloyds - Britain's biggest mortgage lender. Its announcements meant that it planned, across the group, to have just 386 Lloyds-branded branches left, with Halifax down to 281. Bank of Scotland would have just 90 once the closure programme was completed. Critics have long accused the industry of failing to sufficiently invest their branch closure savings in better online services. But a UK Finance spokesperson said: \"All banks invest heavily in their systems and technology to ensure customers have easy access to banking services. \"Where issues arise, they work extremely hard to rectify them quickly and to support their customers. \"Banks have been posting information on their websites and social media accounts to ensure they keep customers updated.\" Read more from Sky News:Donald Trump opens door to US-UK 'real trade deal'Trump's China tariff escalation spooks global marketsCouncil finances 'becoming unsustainable' Are banks doing enough? Earlier this month, The Treasury committee of MPs wrote to bank bosses to request information on the scale and impact of IT failures over the past two years. Their responses should have been received by Wednesday. It followed an outage at Barclays which led to some customers being unable to access some services for up to three days from 31 January. The day marked HMRC's self-assessment deadline alongside payday. The Bank of England has also been taking a greater interest in the issue for financial stability reasons. The MPs sought data from the banks on the volumes of customers affected by glitches - and the compensation that had been offered. Committee chair, Dame Meg Hillier, said then: \"When a bank's IT system goes down, it can be a real problem for our constituents who were relying on accessing certain services so they can buy food or pay bills. \"For it to happen at a major bank such as Barclays at such a crucial time of year is either bad luck or bad planning. Either way, it's important to learn what has happened and what will be done about it. \"The rapidly declining number of high street bank branches makes the impact of IT outages even more painful; that's why I've decided to write to some of our biggest banks and building societies.\""

        "Content": "\n          City editor\n              @MarkKleinmanSky\n The chairman of Kick It Out, the football anti-racism charity, has been shortlisted to become the first head of Britain's proposed new Independent Football Regulator (IFR). Sky News has learnt that Sanjay Bhandari is among three remaining candidates being considered by the government to chair the watchdog. A decision is expected in the coming weeks, and the identities of the other two contenders for the high-profile post were unclear on Friday. Mr Bhandari has chaired Kick It Out's board of trustees since 2019, having been a partner at the professional services firm EY for more than a decade. Money latest: Major banks grapple IT chaos He is also an independent non-executive director of the Lawn Tennis Association, and chairs the Satellite Applications Catapult, which aims to aid innovation in the UK space industry.

The establishment of the regulator, which was originally conceived by the previous Conservative government in the wake of the furore over the failed European Super League project, has triggered deep unrest in the sport. This week, Steve Parish, the influential chairman of Premier League side Crystal Palace, told a sports industry conference organised by the Financial Times that the watchdog \"wants to interfere in all of the things we don't need them to interfere in and help with none of the things we actually need help with\". \"We have a problem that we're constantly being told that we're not a business and [that] we're part of the fabric of communities,\" he is reported to have said. \"At the same time, we're… being treated to the nth degree like a business.\" Interviews for the chair of the football regulator took place in November, and Mr Bhandari's is believed to be the first of the three shortlisted names to be publicly disclosed. The post was advertised with a £130,000-a-year salary, and will be based at the IFR's new home in Manchester. It is the second time a recruitment process has been run for a chair for the IFR, after an earlier hunt was curtailed by the general election. Lisa Nandy, the culture secretary, will sign off on the appointment of a preferred candidate, with the chosen individual expected to face a pre-appointment hearing in front of the Commons culture, media and sport select committee. The Football Governance Bill is proceeding through parliament, with its next stage expected in March. It forms part of a process that represents the most fundamental shake-up in the oversight of English football in the game's history. Read more from Sky News:Payday glitch chaos strikes againDonald Trump opens door to US-UK 'real trade deal'Trump's China tariff escalation spooks global marketsCouncil finances 'becoming unsustainable' The establishment of the body comes with the top tier of the professional game wracked by civil war, with Abu Dhabi-owned Manchester City at the centre of a number of legal cases over its financial dealings. The government has dropped a previous stipulation that the regulator should have regard to British foreign and trade policy when determining the appropriateness of a new club owner. The IFR will monitor clubs' adherence to rules requiring them to listen to fans' views on issues including ticket pricing, while it may also have oversight of the parachute payments made to clubs in the years after their relegation from the Premier League. The top flight has issued a statement expressing reservations about the regulator's remit, while the IFR has been broadly welcomed by the English Football League. A Department for Culture, Media and Sport spokesman said: \"We do not comment on speculation. \"No appointment has been made and the recruitment process for [IFR] chair is ongoing.\" Mr Bhandari could not be reached for comment."

        "Content": "Microsoft has announced it will shut down Skype, once the dominant video call service, in May this year. At its peak, the service boasted more than 300 million users, but that number had fallen to more than 36 million users, according to the most recent figures shared by Microsoft in 2023. The US tech giant, which bought Skype for $8.5bn in 2011, will shift some of its services to Microsoft Teams, its flagship videoconferencing and team applications platform. Skype users will be able to use their existing accounts to log into Teams. From Blackberries to floppy disks and MP3 players, Sky News looks at other pieces of software and hardware that were once ubiquitous but are now obsolete. Dumb phones Smartphones have replaced old-fashioned mobile phones, which were much more limited in features. They could only make and receive calls and texts, though some could play games like Snake. \n                  Banks 'investing heavily' in digital platforms as payday glitch chaos strikes again \n                 \n                  Dozens arrested worldwide over AI-generated child sexual abuse images\n                 \n                  Wild beavers to make a comeback in England after government approves reintroduction\n                 The devices have seen somewhat of a resurgence among people wanting to limit their mobile phone use. Blackberries Blackberries revolutionised typing on mobile phones by including a full keyboard. They were widely used for business communication including email and messaging services. But they were made obsolete by smartphones which transformed the physical keyboard onto the touchscreen. Landlines The first telephone call was made in 1876 and the device has gone through various iterations in the years since. Once commonplace in homes and offices, the wired landline has seen its use decline amid the rise of mobile phones. Floppy disks While data used to be stored on floppy disks, they were later replaced by CD-ROMs and now live on as the save icon for most software. They became increasingly smaller since their appearance in the 1970s. However, they were vulnerable to magnets and heat, which could damage their data. VHS VHS cassette tapes became the standard way to watch films at home from the late 1980s. They had to be rewound at the end of every film, which could be time-consuming. The release of DVDs began the slow decline of the VHS and eventually replaced it. Cassette tapes Cassette tapes were the main way people could listen to and record music from the 1960s. They were also used to store data for early home computers. But by the 90s they were outsold by CDs, which later killed them off. CDs and DVDs CDs and DVDs in turn would follow VHS and cassettes in becoming obsolete in a world of online streaming. The convenience and accessibility of streaming services drove the shift towards digital media, and people often now pay for subscription services rather than individual albums or films. The Walkman and MP3 players Portable music players like the Walkman and MP3 players have also become victims of the rise of the smartphone. Smartphones with integrated music apps and streaming services made separate music players mostly redundant. Pagers Pagers once let people know someone was trying to contact them, but they would have to head to a landline or phone booth to call them back. Mobile phones offered instant communication, making pagers obsolete. Smartphones further revolutionised communication by offering video calls and internet access for instant messaging. Fax machines Fax machines in offices were used to send and receive documents, especially those requiring signatures. They could also be used to send confidential information securely over phone lines. But they were replaced by emails and instant messaging services. Overhead projectors Schools and offices used overhead projectors to project documents onto a screen for everyone to see. Teachers and professionals could use them to display annotated notes and diagrams. They were made obsolete by modern projectors and computers."

        "Content": " Donald Trump has opened the door to a possible US-UK trade deal without tariffs after a meeting with Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer. As part of a European charm offensive launched to secure a lasting peace in Ukraine, following on from French President Emmanuel Macron's own trip on Monday, Sir Keir met the US president at the White House yesterday. It comes ahead of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's own visit to Washington today.  During the meeting and a subsequent news conference, the two world leaders exchanged warm words - Mr Trump described Sir Keir as a \"special man\" and a \"great gentleman\", while the British PM praised the US leader for \"changing the conversation\" on Ukraine. 'Tough negotiator' The Republican president has slapped tariffs on a number of countries in the early weeks of his first term, including using them to pressure allies into action. But he hinted the UK could avoid that fate. Mr Trump said he thought the UK and US could end up with a \"real trade deal\" without tariffs and called Sir Keir a \"tough negotiator\" who had tried to persuade him not to impose trade tariffs on the UK. \"He was working hard, I'll tell you that,\" the president added. \"He earned whatever the hell they pay him over there, but he tried. \"I think there's a very good chance that in the case of these two great, friendly countries, I think we could very well end up with a real trade deal where the tariffs wouldn't be necessary. We'll see.\" Trump's 'great warm spot' The surprisingly positive meeting followed recent weeks in which it appeared the transatlantic relationship had come under strain - following Mr Trump's intervention to try to bring about the end of the war in Ukraine. Mr Trump spoke about the UK, saying: \"I have investments there, I own Turnberry, I own Aberdeen, and I own a great place called Doonbeg in Ireland [Ireland isn't in the UK]. \"So, I have a great warm spot for your country.\" Ukraine and Chagos Islands The key reason for the visit was to try to bring about a sustainable peace in Ukraine. Sir Keir followed Mr Macron into the Oval Office in an effort to win over Mr Trump after his administration held unilateral talks with Russia last week, without Ukraine, in a move that set off sirens throughout Europe's capitals. However, Mr Trump offered no security guarantees during the meeting with Sir Keir and the two leaders struck different tones. While Mr Trump said \"if it [a peace deal] doesn't happen quickly, it may not happen at all\", Sir Keir said \"history must be on the side of the peacemaker, not the invader\".  The actions of Sir Keir and Mr Macron reflected a continent jolted into action. Sir Keir recently announced a historic hike in defence spending as well - something Mr Trump has previously called for. Mr Zelenskyy is making the same trip to the US where he will sit down and thrash out a possible deal on critical minerals in Ukraine. The economic deal has proven a crucial precursor of any potential peace agreement. Mr Trump has said it would see American workers in Ukraine - something that would act as an effective backstop to any peacekeeping forces there, he claimed. On the Chagos Islands deal, over which some have criticised Sir Keir, Mr Trump said the plan to give up sovereignty and lease back the US-UK base would \"work out well\". Read more:What we can read from Trump's royal inviteStarmer contradicts Vance over free speech claim A royal invitation and gifts Before talks between the two sides, Sir Keir produced, with a flourish, a letter from the King written to Mr Trump, inviting him for an \"unprecedented\" second state visit. The letter, marked \"private and confidential\", invited the royal-loving president to the UK, with talks ahead of the formal state visit to discuss logistics and a potential programme. The two world leaders also exchanged gifts, with the prime minister giving Mr Trump a family tartan golf cap and Downing Street golf balls, among other gifts - and receiving a US football shirt with his surname and number 10 on the back. Busy week for Starmer On Sunday, Sir Keir will round off a busy international week with a string of foreign engagements that include welcoming President Zelenskyy to Downing Street and convening a summit of European leaders in London for discussions on Ukraine - building on a meeting in Paris earlier this month. He will also chair a call with Baltic countries and welcome Italy's prime minister Giorgia Meloni. In an interview with The Spectator, held after the US-UK meeting, Mr Trump reportedly said he was surprised how well he and Sir Keir got along, and touched on the situation in Ukraine as well. Describing it as a \"vicious war\" he spoke about North Korea's entrance into the fighting, saying: \"They learned the hard way... they have suffered tremendous casualties.\" In the same interview, the outlet reported that former US president Joe Biden blamed his Democratic successor Barack Obama as well as Nancy Pelosi for his election loss."

But one consequence of higher import costs due to the duties is the fact they risk stoking US inflation, as costs are passed on. Brent crude oil was down by almost 1% to trade at $73 a barrel. Cryptocurrencies took the largest hammering. Bitcoin was 27% below its record high set in January at $79,740 and down by 6% on the day.  Mr Trump told reporters in the Oval Office he decided to add the extra tariffs on China and stick to the deadline for Canada and Mexico because of what his administration sees as insufficient progress on curbing fentanyl flows into the country. \"There are ongoing discussions with the Chinese, Mexico and Canada,\" a White House official told the Reuters news agency. \"We've gotten a good handle on the migration issue, but there are still concerns on the other issue of fentanyl deaths.\" It was a narrative that was firmly rejected by China's foreign ministry. A spokesperson said China would take all necessary measures to firmly safeguard its legitimate interest. \"The US is once again using the fentanyl issue as a pretext to threaten China\", Lin Jian told a regular news conference.

The EU, in particular, will be in focus. \"An amicable start to talks with UK premier Keir Starmer looks to have set the tone for a potential trade deal with the UK but with no details outlined it has not been enough to boost enthusiasm for London listed shares.\""

        "Content": "By Kate Schneider and Joely Santa Cruz, data journalists   From bin collections and parks to social care, it's estimated local authorities in England provide more than 800 services for residents, touching on many different aspects of our lives all the way from childhood to elderly care.  A National Audit Office report found spending on services increased by £12.8bn - from £60bn to £72.8bn - between 2015-16 and 2023-24, a 21% increase in real terms. Most of this increased spending - £10.3bn - has gone to adult and children's social care, which represents councils' biggest spend, increasing as a share of overall spending from 53% to 58% over the period. Previous central funding cuts and an increasing population mean that spending power per person has largely stagnated, however, and remains 1% lower per person than in 2015/16, the report said. This is a measure of the funding available to local authorities from central government grants, council tax and business rates. Though grant funding has increased in recent years, it has not yet made up for pre-2020 government cuts. Complex needs The population in England has increased by 5% over the period, accounting for some of this increased pressure, but it's not the only driver. In many areas, demand has outpaced population growth, as external events and the complexity of people's needs has shifted over time. The rapid increase in costs of temporary accommodation, for example, has been driven by the large increases in people facing homelessness because of inflationary pressures and housing shortages. At the same time, demand for new adult social care plans has increased by 15%. As life expectancies have increased, the length of time in people's lives during which they suffer from health problems has also increased. \"We see that in adult social care that people have multiple conditions and need more and more support and often will be appearing as if they're frailer at an earlier age. So that's an important trend,\" explained Melanie Williams, president of the Association of Directors of Adult Social Services. \"We're constantly focusing on most urgent things at the expense of not doing the preventative work,\" she added. \"When we're just focusing on getting people home from hospital, we're not doing that piece of work to enable them not to go there in the first place.\" Budget cliff edge over SEND spending  Meanwhile, demand for education, health and care (EHC) plans, for children with more complex special educational support needs has more than doubled, increasing by 140% to 576,000. Budgets for special educational needs and disabilities (SEND) have not kept pace, meaning local authority spending has consistently outstripped government funding, leading to substantial deficits in council budgets. Most authorities with responsibilities for SEND have overspent their budget as they have been allowed to until March 2026 on a temporary override, but they will need to draw on their own reserves to make these payments in a year. One in three councils will have deficits that they can't cover when the override ends. Cuts to services  In the latest figures for 2023/24, the NAO found £3 in every £5 of services spending by English local authorities went towards social care and education, totalling £42.3bn. This has left little headroom for other services, many of which have experienced real-terms financial cuts over the same time period, with councils forced to identify other services like libraries, parks and the arts to make savings. But, Williams warned, cultural and environmental services like these can play a vital role in wellbeing and may actually exacerbate demand for social care. \"For us to be able to safeguard both adults and children - so people that need extra support - we do need that wider bit for councils to do,\" said Williams, who also serves as corporate director of adult social care for Nottingham County Council. \"It's no good me just providing care and support if somebody can't go out and access a park, or go out and access leisure, or go out and have that wider support in the community.\" Commenting on the report, Cllr Tim Oliver, chairman of the County Councils Network, said: \"As we have warned, councils have little choice but to spend more and more on the most demand-intensive services, at the expense of everything else - leaving them providing little more than care services. \"It is market-specific cost pressures, mainly in adult social care, children's services, and special educational needs, that are driving councils' costs rather than deprivation. Therefore government must recognise and address these pressures in its fair funding review, otherwise it will push many well-run councils to the brink.\" Fighting fires  The NAO report describes a vicious cycle where councils' limited budgets have resulted in a focus on reactive care addressing the most urgent needs. More efficient preventative care that could lower demand in the long term has fallen to the wayside. In one example cited by the NAO, the Public Health Grant, which funds preventative health services, is expected to fall in real terms by £846m (20.1%) between 2015/16 and 2024/25. Other areas have seen a switch in funding from prevention to late intervention. Councils' funding towards homelessness support services increased by £1.57bn between 2015/16 and 2013/24, while money for preventative and other housing services fell by £0.64bn. Financing overhaul needed  Since 2018, seven councils have issued section 114 notices, which indicate that a council's planned spending will breach the Local Government Finance Act when the local authority believes it's become unable to balance its budget. And 42 local authorities have received over £5bn of support through the Exceptional Financial Support (EFS) framework since its introduction in 2020. According to a recent Local Government Association survey referenced in the NAO report, up to 44% of councils believe they'll have to issue a section 114 notice within the next two years should the UK government cease providing exceptional financial support. Read more:Councils to get £68m to build thousands of homesCouncil tax to rise to pay for police funding increaseCouncils to receive £1bn boost to tackle homelessness Looking ahead to upcoming funding settlements, and the government's planned reforms of local government, the NAO warns that short-term measures to address acute funding shortfalls have not addressed the systemic weaknesses in the funding model, with a whole system overhaul required. Sir Geoffrey Clifton-Brown, chair of the Committee of Public Accounts, said: \"Short-term support is a sticking plaster to the underlying pressures facing local authorities. Delays in local audits are further undermining public confidence in local government finances. \"There needs to be a cross-government approach to local government finance reform, which must deliver effective accountability and value for money for taxpayers.\" The Data and Forensics team is a multi-skilled unit dedicated to providing transparent journalism from Sky News.

        "Content": "\n          Political reporter\n              @fayebrownSky\n Anneliese Dodds has quit as international development minister over Sir Keir Starmer's decision to slash the overseas aid budget to pay for an increase in defence spending.  Ms Dodds, who is also women and equalities minister and attends cabinet, said she was resigning from both posts \"with great sadness\" but would continue to support the government from the backbenches. Politics Live: Starmer back in Downing Street after Washington trip  In her resignation letter to the prime minister, she acknowledged there was \"no easy path\" to fund the boost to defence but claimed there had been a \"tactical decision\" for the Overseas Development Aid (ODA) budget to \"absorb the entire burden\". She said: \"You have maintained that you want to continue support for Gaza, Sudan and Ukraine; for vaccination; for climate; and for rules-based systems.  \"Yet it will be impossible to maintain these priorities given the depth of the cut; the effect will be far greater than presented, even if assumptions made about reducing asylum costs hold true.\" Ms Dodds said the cut will likely lead the UK to pull-out from numerous African, Caribbean and Western Balkan nations, as well as a withdrawal of commitments to international banks and a reduced voice in the G7 and G20. \n                  Resignation of Anneliese Dodds 'won't make a difference' to Sir Keir Starmer, says Harriet Harman\n                 \n                  Starmer secured wins for UK at Trump meeting - here's how\n                 \n                  Baltic states 'very unhappy' after UK fails to invite leaders to Ukraine summit\n                 \"Ultimately, these cuts will remove food and healthcare from desperate people - deeply harming the UK's reputation,\" she added. \"I know you have been clear that you are not ideologically opposed to international development. But the reality is that this decision is already being portrayed as following in President Trump's slipstream of cuts to USAID.\"  Around £6bn per year will be taken out of the aid budget and transferred over to pay for defence. That amounts to a reduction in aid spending from 0.5% of GDP to 0.3%. In a letter responding to Ms Dodd's resignation, Sir Keir said the decision to cut foreign aid \"was a difficult and painful decision and not one I take lightly\". \"However, protecting our national security must always be the first duty of any government and I will always act in the best interests of the British people,\" he said.  The resignation comes after a key meeting between Sir Keir and Mr Trump on Thursday, during which the US leader praised the defence sending decision and also touted the prospect of a tariff-free trade deal.  Ms Dodds marks the loss of a fourth minister from the new Labour government, after Louise Haigh and Tulip Siddiq resigned and Andrew Gwynne was sacked.  Conservative MP Andrew Mitchell, who was the international development minister under Rishi Sunak, said Ms Dodds had \"done the right thing\". He posted on X: \"Labour's disgraceful and cynical actions demean the Labour Party's reputation as they balance the books on the backs of the poorest people in the world. Shame on them and kudos to a politician of decency and principle.\" Political correspondent She was one of his closest allies, but today Anneliese Dodds has quit Keir Starmer's government with a stark warning about the direction of travel. It's been quite a journey since she got the top job in his opposition cabinet. When he took over as Labour leader, she was appointed shadow chancellor and seen as a key player in his team. Since that time, Starmer has shown himself to be a pragmatic, sometimes ruthless, operator when it comes to both policy and political friendships. This resignation once again shows that side. Not only is he pushing through deep cuts to foreign aid – a move he previously condemned - but in doing so, he has also cast aside one of his most loyal and long-standing colleagues. Former Tory defence minister Tobias Ellwood also praised the decision as \"courageous and principled\", saying that national security is \"not just about hard power\" but tackling threats like disease and extremism. However, Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch backed Sir Keir's decision. She said: \"I disagree with the PM on many things BUT on reducing the foreign aid budget to fund UK defence? He's absolutely right. \"He may not be able to convince the ministers in his own cabinet, but on this subject, I will back him. \"National interest always comes first.\" Read more from Sky News:What foreign aid is being cut?'Trump not the reason for UK defence spending boost' Sir Keir announced the decision to cut the aid budget on Tuesday, saying it would fund and increase defence spending from 2.3% of GDP to 2.5% in 2027. Labour's manifesto had pledged to reach this target but it was not clear when that would be achieved or how it would be funded. The prime minister admitted the inauguration of Mr Trump - who has made clear he no longer wants to bankroll NATO's defence- \"accelerated\" his decision but said it had been three years in the making, after Russia's invasion of Ukraine. He said the reduction in foreign aid is \"not a renouncement I'm happy to make\". Asked about it during the Convention of the North conference, deputy prime minister Angela Rayner said: \"I'm sorry to hear she's resigned, it was a really difficult decision that was made.\" However, she said it was \"absolutely right\" that the cabinet endorse the prime minister's actions to spend more money on defence."

Politics Live: Starmer returns from Washington  Ms Dodds resigned on Friday over the prime minister's announcement to slash the overseas aid budget to fund an increase in defence spending. Baroness Harman said it is \"very characteristic\" of the outgoing minister, \"who is a thoroughly principled and decent, loyal person\". She added: \"I think that the truth is that there is such coherence in the cabinet, and Keir Starmer's political management of the cabinet is so absolutely functional and strong that, although I don't want to take away from Annaliese on this, actually it won't make any difference to that.\" It was put to her that the resignation will create bad headlines after Sir Keir's successful trip to Washington to meet Donald Trump. Baroness Harman conceded that \"there'll be a lot of sadness amongst Labour MPs\", and that she personally would have liked to have seen Ms Dodds \"try to refocus what is left of the development agenda\" and \"keep alive the arguments for the pathway back to 0.7% [GDP spending on foreign aid]\". She said: \"There is a hard reality, which is that money needed to be found and it needed to be found really quickly, because when it became clear towards the end of the weekend that actually the defence spending had to go up on a timescale, and therefore there would need to be switch spending that would need to be announced on Tuesday, this became the only option.\" Former leader of the Scottish Tories Ruth Davidson was a bit more frank about the departure, saying the cut to the aid budget put Ms Dodds in a \"completely uncredible\" position as she would have struggled to maintain relationships with organisations the foreign office was working with. She added that Sir Keir already sacked her as shadow chancellor in the early days of his leadership and then as party chairman after the election. \"She ran this amazing election campaign, they had this amazing majority. He fired her the very next day and made her a junior minister, and then he gutted her budget,\" said Ms Davidson. \"She had nowhere else to go.\" In her resignation letter to the prime minister, Ms Dodds acknowledged there was \"no easy path\" to fund the boost to defence but claimed there had been a \"tactical decision\" for the Overseas Development Aid (ODA) budget to \"absorb the entire burden\".

        "Content": "By Beth Rigby, political editor, in Washington   \"Relieved is an understatement\". That's how one senior government figure described their mood as the prime minister, his foreign secretary and the Number 10 team left the White House having cemented Sir Keir and President Trump's personal relationship; secured a commitment to NATO; the prospect of a trade deal that could spare the UK from tariffs and the presidential nod on the Chagos deal. That gives you a sense of just how much was at stake going into talks with a president that has heaped criticism on many old allies in recent weeks. That the Starmer-Trump meeting went as well as it did is proof, say those around the prime minister, of how much legwork and meticulous planning has gone into pulling it off. The work began in opposition with Keir Starmer calling President Trump after the assassination attempt, while his foreign secretary courted vice president JD Vance. There was the dinner in Trump Tower in September and, ever since then a prime minister who has swerved any personal or public criticism of the president. When the visit was confirmed, the Number 10 team war-gamed all the possibilities with the prime minister, I'm told, going through all the detail and planning with aides to \"make the most of the visit\". \n                  Trump-Zelenskyy row is triumph for Russia - and makes UK summit of European leaders all the more critical\n                 \n                  Trump-Zelenskyy clash: Sky News correspondents' views\n                 \n                  Will ministerial resignation dent Starmer's post-Trump high?\n                 They came out feeling that all the pieces fell into place with wins for the UK on trade and a \"special\" Keir Starmer coming through talks with President Trump that you could have a positive relationship with President Trump.  There were a few factors that helped the prime minister. The first was the president's genuine love for the UK and Sir Keir's team's understanding that President Trump is driven by personal relationships. Get that right and much of the rest falls into place, say those who have seen him up close. Sir Keir Starmer, the ponderous lawyer, has I'm told also built a genuinely warm relationship with President Trump: \"They genuinely like each other and find each other easy to speak to,\" is how one observer put it. Then came the deployment of soft power.  I was in the Oval Office when the prime minister procured a personal letter from his jacket pocket from the King inviting President Trump for a second state visit. Mr Trump was genuinely delighted as he read the letter, marvelled at King Charles's signature and pointed out that this was the first time in history that anyone had been afforded such an \"incredible\" honour. The prime minister also brought something to the table for a president that loves a deal. The decision to lift defence spending to 2.5% of GDP by 2027 went down extremely well on Capitol Hill with Republicans and signalled to President Trump that the UK was an ally that had heeded his message on defence spending. There were wins too. Keir Starmer's deal to transfer sovereignty over the Chagos Islands, where the US has a critical military base, to Mauritius, was backed by President Trump, a hugely welcome moment for a PM who has been heavily criticised about the deal back home. And when I asked the president about his sharp remarks on EU tariffs - he said the union had been constructed to \"screw\" the US on trade - he told me he'd been having problems with the EU bit was in a \"very different place\" with the UK. \"I have a great warm spot for your country,\" President Trump told me before the talks.  Afterwards, he told reporters at the press conference in the East Wing of the White House that there was a \"very good chance\" of a trade deal in which tariffs were not necessary. Of course, there is a long way to go, but against a backdrop of a president threatening tariffs on a number of countries, that was a big win for the PM. But if going out of this short visit was a story of trade, going into it was a focus on security guarantees for Ukraine. Sir Keir said securing a backstop for European peacekeepers in Ukraine is the only way to contain President Putin. Read more:Starmer contradicts Vance over free speech claimRead some of Trump's letter from King CharlesTop five moments from Trump-Starmer press conference  On this, President Trump was rather more noncommittal, stressing that the priority was to do the deal first and that the mineral agreement he is poised to sign with President Zelenskyy on Friday should be deterrent enough. On Sunday, the PM will host 18 leaders in London to discuss what to do next. Ultimately, Europe will need to know that the US has its back on Ukraine - the PM didn't come away from the Trump meeting assured of that yet. Although, the message for more NATO investment was heard loud and clear again, with an expectation from the British camp that more commitment on defence spending from Europe will be required by President Trump as part of any backstop deal. What is clear coming out of this meeting is that Sir Keir and the UK could genuinely become the bridge between the US and Europe as the deteriorating relationship between Brussels and Washington offers Sir Keir the opportunity to take the centre stage. After a bumpy start to his premiership, the prime minister has found in his endeavour on Ukraine, a means to show leadership - and perhaps a way to win doubtful voters back around. He has managed to find a way with President Trump. Sunday's summit is his next test as he brings together President Zelenskyy with fellow European leaders to try to hammer out a plan to support any peace deal. Starmer was an unlikely war footing leader. But he is finding a way."

The source, with knowledge of the situation, warned that Moscow would notice with interest that Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia have been excluded. \"Russia and our publics will clearly assess this that we are sold out by the US, but also by [the] UK and France,\" said the source, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. Sir Keir Starmer, fresh back from a friendly meeting with Donald Trump in Washington, is due to host the leaders of more than a dozen European countries for a summit in the UK on Sunday to discuss Russia's war in Ukraine and wider European security. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, who is holding talks with the US president at the White House on Friday, is also due to attend. The diplomatic source confirmed Sir Keir would have a phone call with the leaders of the Baltic states - but signalled this was a poor substitute for not participating in the summit, which will take place in person. \"We are truly very unhappy with a refusal to invite the Baltic leaders,\" the source said. The three Baltic countries - located on NATO's eastern flank with Russia - are among the highest defence spenders in NATO as a percentage of GDP.  They are also, relative to their small size, among the biggest supporters of Ukraine - giving weapons and funding to help the Ukrainian armed forces fight off Russia's invasion - and have been the strongest voices in Europe raising the alarm about the threat posed by Russian President Vladimir Putin for years. The source said France was helping to organise the summit with Downing Street. It will be used to discuss support for Ukraine, including a plan to create an international \"reassurance\" force that could be deployed to the country to help secure a ceasefire if the US can negotiate a deal between Kyiv and Moscow. Wider European security will also be discussed after Mr Trump made clear European NATO allies need to take a much greater responsibility for their own security instead of relying on the powerful US military.

And as we know about President Trump, he is a hardheaded businessman and he's not a pushover.\" Asked if the UK could give ground on US access to the health service, Mr Streeting told Sky News: \"The NHS is not up for grabs and it's not on the table in the context of trade. \"But there are a number of areas where we can and should work together to deepen the trading relationship between our two countries.\" The cabinet minister did not say which areas could be looked at, but later told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that \"in terms of life sciences and medical technology, there's a lot that we've got to offer the United States and there's a lot that we could get from the United States given our two countries' strengths\". He suggested NHS patients could be offered up in clinical trials, which in turn would mean British people \"are at the front of the queue for those new treatments and technologies\" and \"that we get a good deal on price\". Ministers are buoyed by the possibility of a UK-US trade deal after a positive meeting between Sir Keir and the US president in Washington on Thursday, which came as part of a European charm offensive launched to secure a lasting peace in Ukraine  During the meeting and a subsequent news conference, the pair exchanged warm words, with Mr Trump calling the British PM a \"special man\" and a \"great gentleman\". Sir Keir returned the compliments by praising the US leader for \"changing the conversation\" on Ukraine. Mr Trump touted the possibility of a long-sought after US-UK trade deal, saying this could happen \"very quickly\" and without the kind of tariffs he is threatening elsewhere. A free trade deal with the US was promised by the Tories after the Brexit referendum but it was not achieved by the time they lost the election in July - with former prime minister Rishi Sunak previously blaming the war in Ukraine and the COVID pandemic.

Deal 'achievable within six months' Previous sticking points have included chlorinated chicken and access to the NHS for US pharmaceutical companies. Chris Southworth, secretary general of the International Chamber of Commerce (ICC), told Sky News this could be prevented if the UK \"avoids going down the route\" of a full Free Trade Agreement (FTA) - focusing on finance and tech instead. He said a deal like this could be \"achieved within six months as we are so aligned in these areas\", calling yesterday's meeting a \"game-changer\" that could help with Chancellor Rachel Reeve's growth agenda while benefiting the US economy too. Liberal Democrat deputy leader Daisy Cooper told Sky News it was likely a deal could focus on services, but urged the government to focus on striking a better deal with Europe too. She said: \"We do think it's possible to negotiate a trade deal, probably on services with the US. \"But clearly there are some red lines that I think most people in the UK would sign up to, which is that any trade deal must absolutely not undermine our NHS, and it absolutely must not undermine the very high food and animal welfare standards that our British farmers maintain in our food supply as well.\""

        "Content": "The government has called an \"urgent meeting\" with the head of the BBC over a controversial documentary about Gaza. Culture Secretary Lisa Nandy has said she will be meeting with the chair of the corporation today to get \"assurances that no stone will be left unturned\" in the inquiry into the programme. Gaza: How To Survive A Warzone has been pulled from iPlayer and will not be broadcast on channels again after it emerged that the child narrator is the son of Ayman Alyazouri, who has worked as Hamas's deputy minister of agriculture. Politics latest: What did Starmer and Trump gift each other?  In a statement, the BBC confirmed the family had been paid for the work. The corporation said the documentary was made on commission by a company called Hoyo Films, and that Hoyo did not say the narrator had links to Hamas despite being asked and knowing it to be the case. Ms Nandy said: \"The BBC has acknowledged serious failings by them and the production company Hoyo Films. \"The public rightly holds the BBC to the highest standards of reporting and governance which is why I will be having an urgent meeting with the BBC Chair later today. I want assurances that no stone will be left unturned by the fact-finding review now commissioned by the BBC's director general. \"This review must be comprehensive, rigorous and get to the bottom of exactly what has happened in this case. It is critical for trust in the BBC that this review happens quickly, and that appropriate action is taken on its findings.\" Shadow culture secretary Stuart Andrew raised concerns that public funds had \"indirectly supported a terrorist organisation\", and Tory leader Kemi Badenoch wrote to the BBC calling for an inquiry into \"the BBC's entire pattern of systemic bias against Israel\". After the discovery about the father of 13-year-old Abdullah al Yazouri, who speaks about life in Gaza during the war between Israel and Hamas, the BBC added a disclaimer to the programme and later removed it from its online catch-up service. In a statement released last night, a BBC spokesperson said \"serious flaws\" had been found in the making of the documentary. \"Some of these were made by the production company, and some by the BBC; all of them are unacceptable,\" they added. \"BBC News takes full responsibility for these and the impact that these have had on the corporation's reputation. We apologise for this.\" It went on: \"Although the programme was made by an independent production company, who were commissioned to deliver a fully compliant documentary, the BBC has ultimate editorial responsibility for this programme as broadcast.\" Turning to Hoyo Films, the spokesperson said: \"During the production process, the independent production company was asked in writing a number of times by the BBC, about any potential connections he and his family might have with Hamas. \"Since transmission, they have acknowledged that they knew that the boy's father was a deputy agriculture minister in the Hamas government; they have also acknowledged that they never told the BBC this fact. \"It was then the BBC's own failing that we did not uncover that fact and the documentary was aired.\" Read more:Trump shares AI video of Gaza visionHostage 'tortured and starved' in GazaSix newborns die from severe cold in Gaza  \"Hoyo Films have told us that they paid the boy's mother, via his sister's bank account, a limited sum of money for the narration. \"While Hoyo Films have assured us that no payments were made to members of Hamas or its affiliates, either directly, in kind, or as a gift, the BBC is seeking additional assurance around the budget of the programme and will undertake a full audit of expenditure. \"We are requesting the relevant financial accounts of the production company in order to do that.\" The spokesperson said complaints about the programme will be expedited, and will be adjudicated by an independent reviewer. Hoyo Films said in a statement: \"We are co-operating fully with the BBC and Peter Johnston (director of editorial complaints and reviews) to help understand where mistakes have been made. \"We feel this remains an important story to tell, and that our contributors - who have no say in the war - should have their voices heard.\""

The deal includes an additional £889m in funding for the year 2025 to 2026 and is designed to end the \"8am scramble\" for appointments. Health Secretary Wes Streeting told Sky News it would \"modernise the way that people can book appointments\" and \"bring back the family-doctor relationship\". He said it was \"slashing the red tape that ties GPs up\" and had \"almost halved the number of measures and bureaucracy that GPs have to undertake\". From October, the reforms will require GP surgeries to allow patients to request appointments online in a bid to free-up phone lines for urgent enquires and help end the 8am rush to book appointments over the phone. GPs will also be incentivised to identify patients who would benefit from seeing their regular doctor at every consultation. Targets, including those requiring surgeries to report on staff wellbeing meetings, have also been scrapped to allow doctors to spend more time treating patients. Announcing the agreement, Mr Streeting said: \"Today, we have taken the first step to fixing the front door to the NHS, bringing back the family doctor, and ending the 8am scramble.  \"Over the past decade, funding for GPs has been cut relative to the rest of the NHS, while the number of targets for GPs has soared.

The Department of Health and Social Care has said it marks a \"reset of relations\" after recent strikes. It said it would \"ease pressures\" on other parts of the NHS, including A&E. Dr Amanda Doyle, NHS England national director for primary care and community services, said: \"This is the first time in four years that the GP contract has been accepted as proposed and I hope it will be seen as positive for practices, GP teams and patients when introduced in April. \"It shows how NHS England and the Department of Health and Social Care have listened and delivered on the priorities that matter most to patients and general practice teams, including a significant increase in funding and extra flexibility in the additional roles reimbursement scheme to recruit more staff including GPs.\""

        "Content": "Microsoft has announced it will shut down Skype, once the dominant video call service, in May this year. At its peak, the service boasted more than 300 million users, but that number had fallen to more than 36 million users, according to the most recent figures shared by Microsoft in 2023. The US tech giant, which bought Skype for $8.5bn in 2011, will shift some of its services to Microsoft Teams, its flagship videoconferencing and team applications platform. Skype users will be able to use their existing accounts to log into Teams. From Blackberries to floppy disks and MP3 players, Sky News looks at other pieces of software and hardware that were once ubiquitous but are now obsolete. Dumb phones Smartphones have replaced old-fashioned mobile phones, which were much more limited in features. They could only make and receive calls and texts, though some could play games like Snake. \n                  Banks 'investing heavily' in digital platforms as payday glitch chaos strikes again \n                 \n                  Dozens arrested worldwide over AI-generated child sexual abuse images\n                 \n                  Wild beavers to make a comeback in England after government approves reintroduction\n                 The devices have seen somewhat of a resurgence among people wanting to limit their mobile phone use. Blackberries Blackberries revolutionised typing on mobile phones by including a full keyboard. They were widely used for business communication including email and messaging services. But they were made obsolete by smartphones which transformed the physical keyboard onto the touchscreen. Landlines The first telephone call was made in 1876 and the device has gone through various iterations in the years since. Once commonplace in homes and offices, the wired landline has seen its use decline amid the rise of mobile phones. Floppy disks While data used to be stored on floppy disks, they were later replaced by CD-ROMs and now live on as the save icon for most software. They became increasingly smaller since their appearance in the 1970s. However, they were vulnerable to magnets and heat, which could damage their data. VHS VHS cassette tapes became the standard way to watch films at home from the late 1980s. They had to be rewound at the end of every film, which could be time-consuming. The release of DVDs began the slow decline of the VHS and eventually replaced it. Cassette tapes Cassette tapes were the main way people could listen to and record music from the 1960s. They were also used to store data for early home computers. But by the 90s they were outsold by CDs, which later killed them off. CDs and DVDs CDs and DVDs in turn would follow VHS and cassettes in becoming obsolete in a world of online streaming. The convenience and accessibility of streaming services drove the shift towards digital media, and people often now pay for subscription services rather than individual albums or films. The Walkman and MP3 players Portable music players like the Walkman and MP3 players have also become victims of the rise of the smartphone. Smartphones with integrated music apps and streaming services made separate music players mostly redundant. Pagers Pagers once let people know someone was trying to contact them, but they would have to head to a landline or phone booth to call them back. Mobile phones offered instant communication, making pagers obsolete. Smartphones further revolutionised communication by offering video calls and internet access for instant messaging. Fax machines Fax machines in offices were used to send and receive documents, especially those requiring signatures. They could also be used to send confidential information securely over phone lines. But they were replaced by emails and instant messaging services. Overhead projectors Schools and offices used overhead projectors to project documents onto a screen for everyone to see. Teachers and professionals could use them to display annotated notes and diagrams. They were made obsolete by modern projectors and computers."

        "Content": "\n          Business and economics reporter\n              @SkyNewsBiz\n The banking sector is \"investing heavily\" in digital platforms, according to the body which represents the country's lenders as many face a backlash over the latest payday glitch chaos to hit customers. Millions were exposed on Friday to varying challenges from slow app or online banking performance to being blocked out of their accounts altogether. Users said the brands that had encountered issues - which did not appear to be related - included Lloyds, Halifax, Nationwide, TSB, Bank of Scotland and First Direct. Money latest: How is my bank affected by banking glitch? It marked the second month in a row for payday problems and no reasons have been given for the disruption. The industry has been historically reluctant to talk about common challenges in digital banking provision but its mouthpiece, UK Finance, told Sky News there was help available and protections in place during times of disruption while acknowledging customer frustrations. The body spoke up as MPs and regulators take a greater interest in the resilience issue due to mounting concerns over the number of glitches. \n                  Money blog: Microsoft 'retiring' Skype later this year - and telling users to switch\n                 \n                  Kick It Out chair Bhandari shortlisted to head new football regulator\n                 \n                  Microsoft is shutting down Skype: What other technologies have become obsolete?\n                  All this comes at a time when major lenders face criticism for continuing to cut branch services at a regular pace - blaming ever higher demand for online services. The UK's big banking brands have been shutting branches since the fallout from the financial crisis in 2008, which sparked a rush to cut costs. The uptake of digital banking services has seen more than 6,200 sites go to the wall since 2015, according to the consumer group Which? The latest closures were revealed last month by Lloyds - Britain's biggest mortgage lender. Its announcements meant that it planned, across the group, to have just 386 Lloyds-branded branches left, with Halifax down to 281. Bank of Scotland would have just 90 once the closure programme was completed. Critics have long accused the industry of failing to sufficiently invest their branch closure savings in better online services. But a UK Finance spokesperson said: \"All banks invest heavily in their systems and technology to ensure customers have easy access to banking services. \"Where issues arise, they work extremely hard to rectify them quickly and to support their customers. \"Banks have been posting information on their websites and social media accounts to ensure they keep customers updated.\" Read more from Sky News:Donald Trump opens door to US-UK 'real trade deal'Trump's China tariff escalation spooks global marketsCouncil finances 'becoming unsustainable' Are banks doing enough? Earlier this month, The Treasury committee of MPs wrote to bank bosses to request information on the scale and impact of IT failures over the past two years. Their responses should have been received by Wednesday. It followed an outage at Barclays which led to some customers being unable to access some services for up to three days from 31 January. The day marked HMRC's self-assessment deadline alongside payday. The Bank of England has also been taking a greater interest in the issue for financial stability reasons. The MPs sought data from the banks on the volumes of customers affected by glitches - and the compensation that had been offered. Committee chair, Dame Meg Hillier, said then: \"When a bank's IT system goes down, it can be a real problem for our constituents who were relying on accessing certain services so they can buy food or pay bills. \"For it to happen at a major bank such as Barclays at such a crucial time of year is either bad luck or bad planning. Either way, it's important to learn what has happened and what will be done about it. \"The rapidly declining number of high street bank branches makes the impact of IT outages even more painful; that's why I've decided to write to some of our biggest banks and building societies.\""

Most of the 25 suspects - who are believed to be part of a criminal group - were arrested in simultaneous operations this week, Europol said on Friday. The main suspect, a Danish national arrested in November, is thought to have run an online platform, where he distributed the AI-generated child sexual abuse material (CSAM). Users could pay for an account that would grant them access to it. So far the probe, which is codenamed Operation Cumberland and led by Danish law enforcement, has resulted in 273 suspects being identified in 19 countries, 33 houses being searched, and 173 items seized. Europol and the Joint Cybercrime Action Taskforce (J-CAT) are helping to coordinate the global investigation, with further arrests expected in the coming weeks.

It noted there were no signs of forced entry.  Where were the bodies found? The bodies of the couple, who married in 1991, were found in separate rooms, authorities say. The officers first found Arakawa in the bathroom near the home's entrance, the sheriff's office stated. It said she was on the floor next to a space heater, with scattered pills and an open prescription bottle on a countertop near her. A German Shepherd was found dead in a bathroom closet near Arakawa, police added. Two healthy dogs were also found near the bodies. Hackman's body was discovered in a mudroom near the kitchen. Authorities say the couple had seemingly been dead for some time. Santa Fe sheriff Adan Mendoza told Sky News' US partner NBC News it appeared the couple could have been dead for \"several days, possibly even up to a couple weeks\" before being found. He said it was \"hard to determine\" whether the couple had died at the same time or not.

Preliminary findings from a medical investigation have found the couple suffered \"no external trauma\". After they found the couple, the deputies searched the rest of the property and found nothing else \"out of place\", according to the warrant. All other buildings on the property and the garage were locked, and there was no evidence that the house had been \"rummaged through or items were taken from inside\". It also said there was no sign of a gas leak. The actor's daughter had earlier suggested they may have been killed by carbon monoxide - but the cause of death remains unclear. Speaking to TMZ, Elizabeth Jean Hackman said the family was not sure but thought the couple may have died from toxic fumes.  An investigator noted people may not show signs of poisoning if they are exposed to gas leaks or carbon monoxide, but the local utility company tested gas lines in and around the home after the bodies were found and did not find any sign of problems, the warrant said. In a statement to Sky News, the sheriff's office said: \"We do not believe foul play was a factor in their deaths, however exact cause of death has not been determined at this time.\" Why has it been ruled 'suspicious enough' for investigation? The sheriff's office outlined the reasons why the deaths were \"suspicious enough\" to require investigating. The warrant pointed to the fact that the property's front door was open, as well as two of the couple's dogs being found alive while another was dead. It also said the space heater being on the floor by Arakawa's head was a factor, as were the pills scattered on the counter. Earlier in the warrant document, it was noted that she could have knocked the heater over as she fell. Sheriff Mendoza said that the pills and prescription bottle were \"very important evidence\", and that other medications found in the house were \"something of concern\". The sheriff's office said another oddity was the fact the couple were found in separate rooms and that there was no obvious sign of a gas leak. Sheriff Mendoza has said investigators have not ruled anything out. What is happening now? Investigators are waiting for the results of a toxicology report, which could take up to three months or longer, Sheriff Mendoza said. In the meantime, they are putting together a timeline of the couple's final weeks, seeking to determine when they were last seen and spoken to, and trying to determine if they died at the same time. The sheriff noted the investigation was only \"a couple of days old\" and said finding clear answers required patience."

        "Content": " Awards season is often predictable. Last year, our crystal ball reading ahead of Oscars night was pretty much perfect - Oppenheimer cleaned up at every ceremony going, and it all started to get a bit Groundhog Day. While it's true some Oscars this year are all but dead certs, for others - and most excitingly, it's the big ones - there are fairly large question marks. Which is much more fun. Here's the verdict from Sky News entertainment team journalists Katie Spencer, Claire Gregory, Bethany Minelle and Gemma Peplow - who will win, and who they think should win. Inspired by Conclave, we've held a secret(ish) ballot. BEST FILM The nomineesAnora, The Brutalist, A Complete Unknown, Conclave, Dune: Part Two, Emilia Perez, I'm Still Here, Nickel Boys, The Substance, Wicked Who will win: Conclave - II; Anora - IIWho should win: The Brutalist - I; Anora - III \"The best picture is a battle of head v heart for me. Conclave is great, but Anora is so fresh, exciting and unexpected as a best picture nominee I would love to see it take the top prize. I just don't think it will beat those scheming priests.\"Arts and entertainment editor Claire Gregory \"Conclave is solid, compelling and classy, with a great ensemble cast. I think the Academy may secretly have resented being made to sit through three-and-a-half hours of anything, even if The Brutalist is a cinematic masterpiece. But if it was me voting, The Brutalist should win - a masterful lesson in storytelling.\"Arts and entertainment correspondent Katie Spencer \"Anora is a rags-to-riches indie story with a twist and is worthy of all the plaudits it is getting. I think it will win and should win - it has a cracking cast, skilled direction, a propulsive storyline, and humour to boot. Even excessive Take That playtime didn't take off the shine.\"Arts and entertainment reporter Bethany Minelle \"A few years ago, Conclave, a thriller about the election of a new pope, would have had this in the bag over screwball anti-fairytale Anora, which follows a young sex worker who marries the son of a Russian oligarch. But, the Academy embraced the madcap Everything Everywhere All At Once in 2023 and after the seriousness of Oppenheimer last year, plus the momentum Anora has gained, I reckon voters could be in the mood for something a little less traditional again.\"Culture and entertainment reporter, Gemma Peplow BEST ACTOR The nomineesAdrien Brody - The BrutalistTimothee Chalamet - A Complete UnknownColman Domingo - Sing SingRalph Fiennes - ConclaveSebastian Stan - The Apprentice Who will win: Adrien Brody - II; Timothee Chalamet - IIWho should win: Colman Domingo - III; Adrien Brody - I \"Adrien Brody has put in the work here for his role in The Brutalist, and the fact that after three-and-a-half hours of screentime you are not sick of his face is down to his skill alone. He will win and should win - give the man his second Oscar already.\"BM \"I've a hunch Timothee Chalamet's SAG win reflects who the wider Academy has voted for. If you think back to previous winners it tends to be those who have acted AND done something extra, such as play the piano, endured hours of prosthetics, learned to dance etc. I reckon Timmy's five years spent mastering the guitar, harmonica and sounding like Bob Dylan for his performance in A Complete Unknown will get him across the line.\"KS \"I'm bored of the Adrien/Timmy debate and would frankly rather see Colman Domingo beat them both. For me, he's one of the most consistently brilliant actors working today and Sing Sing deserves more attention than it's got this awards season.\"CG \"I also think Chalamet's SAG win could be the indicator here. The Academy loves a transformation - see consecutive 'real-life' wins for Gary Oldman (Winston Churchill) in 2018, Rami Malek (Freddie Mercury) in 2019, and Renee Zellweger (Judy Garland) in 2020. However, I vote Domingo; not least because his co-star Clarence Maclin, who plays himself in the prison drama Sing Sing, should also have been nominated in the supporting category. Sing Sing is a beautiful story of hope and redemption and Domingo's is an understated but brilliant performance. He's also always the best-dressed man at any ceremony, so his outfit will no doubt deserve its moment, too.\"GP BEST ACTRESS The nomineesCynthia Erivo - WickedKarla Sofía Gascon - Emilia PerezMikey Madison - AnoraDemi Moore - The SubstanceFernanda Torres - I'm Still Here Who will win: Demi Moore - IIIIWho should win: Demi Moore - I; Mikey Madison - III \"This one is too close to call. The Academy has traditionally loved a female ingenue - although Sky News research revealed last year that the age gap between male and female acting winners is definitely closing - which would favour Mikey Madison; and yet, Demi Moore's real-life story arc has also won her a legion of supporters this year. Those arguments are a little reductive and should not take away from the real reasons why both would be worthy winners - for two very different but equally excellent performances - but it would be wrong to say performance is the only thing taken into account when it comes to voting.\"GP \"Like Academy members no doubt, I'm a sucker for the comeback narrative - and Moore winning an Oscar after being written off as a \"popcorn\" actress is too irresistible a story arc, even if deep down, while she's excellent in The Substance, I'm not sure she really gives the best performance of the year.\"CG \"Moore has to win for throwing everything she had at this role. Stripping off, grossing us out, donning prosthetics, getting elbows-deep in blood; she was not afraid to go there. Aside from that, I think cinema-goers and her peers are very happy to have her back again. But, Madison, for the last scene of Anora alone - without saying a word we see how damaged her character really is - she would be a worthy winner.\"KS \"Madison was the surprise best actress winner at the BAFTAs, and at just 25 she's proved herself an actress to be reckoned with. She deserves to follow up with an Oscar - although Moore is a force to be reckoned with.\"BM BEST SUPPORTING ACTOR The nomineesYura Borisov - AnoraKieran Culkin - A Real PainEdward Norton - A Complete UnknownGuy Pearce - The BrutalistJeremy Strong - The Apprentice Who will win: Kieran Culkin - IIIIWho should win: Kieran Culkin - III; Yura Borisov - I \"Kieran Culkin is funny, charismatic and has picked up so much support this award season because people have enjoyed hearing what he has to say when he wins. That should not detract from the fact that he's also brilliant in A Real Pain. So much of his character is about what's going on inside his head and how he manages to bring out that inner turmoil is seriously impressive. For the record, Guy Pearce, Jeremy Strong and Edward Norton would also all be worthy winners for reminding us what brilliant character actors they all are.\"KS \"Hopefully Pearce, Strong, Norton and Borisov have perfected their 'I'm so happy for you' faces by now, as Culkin is pretty much a dead cert. This is one of the most impressive shortlists in recent years, with all five actors demonstrating how incredible performances don't always have to be the ones right in the spotlight.\"GP \"I've changed my mind a few times about supporting actor this year but I think ultimately Kieran Culkin deserves the Oscar - and let's face it, he's bound to give the best speech.\"CG \"One performance on the best supporting list stands out for me: Yura Borisov's sensitive and understated portrayal of a henchman with a heart is a true support role and executed to perfection. He may not take the prize, but he deserves to.\"BM BEST SUPPORTING ACTRESS The nomineesMonica Barbaro - A Complete UnknownAriana Grande - WickedFelicity Jones - The BrutalistIsabella Rossellini - ConclaveZoe Saldana - Emilia Perez Who will win: Zoe Saldana - IIIIWho should win: Zoe Saldana - II; Felicity Jones - I; Ariana Grande - I \"Zoe Saldana should have been nominated for best actress and not supporting for her role in Emilia Perez, as she clearly has more screentime than anyone else in that movie. That said, she's great in it so deserves a win - even if it is in the wrong category.\"CG \"Saldana is the best thing in a bit of a ropey film. She's well respected and I think the Academy will be giving her an Oscar for her career more generally, rather than Emilia Perez. But, I would vote for Felicity Jones, who took on such a physical role in The Brutalist, demonstrating the cost of the Holocaust on her character's body; you believe the pain of her osteoporosis. Both frail and unbelievably strong at the same time.\"KS \"Saldana is a great actress and gives a great performance in Emilia Perez, and following Karla Sofia Gascon's fall from grace she's likely to be the only cast member taking home a prize. One of the highest-grossing female lead actresses in history, and with work spanning an impressive range of genres, she will win and should win.\"BM \"After cleaning up throughout awards season, this is Saldana's to lose. I'm not a fan of Emilia Perez as a film (controversy aside, musicals are not for me, and this one is particularly jarring), but it would be a shame for Saldana to miss out due to the other noise surrounding it all. Having said that, I think Ariana Grande would be a deserving winner. Wicked was not for me (see above re musicals) but her performance is incredibly charismatic, and anyone who has seen her impeccable celebrity impressions will know she has real comedic chops. She shows them off perfectly in Wicked.\"GP BEST DIRECTOR The nomineesSean Baker - AnoraBrady Corbet - The BrutalistJames Mangold - A Complete UnknownJacques Audiard - Emilia PérezCoralie Fargeat - The Substance Who will win: Brady Corbet - II; Sean Baker - IIWho should win: James Mangold - I; Coralie Fargeat - III \"Nothing more complicated here than I'm a fan of James Mangold and I would love to see him win. I suspect it will go to Brady Corbet though as he has been doing well elsewhere and pulled off something pretty impressive in getting The Brutalist made - let alone getting audiences to sit for three-and-a-half hours to watch it.\"CG \"Corbet stuck to his guns, making his film his way, refusing to compromise on his vision. It might be long but the pacing is perfect and Corbet is thoroughly deserving. But, not only did Coralie Fargeat refuse to water down her ideas for The Substance, she actually injected herself with a needle full of the fluorescent liquid to get the shots she wanted - and she personally manned a firehose to spray an entire theatre with fake blood. That's what you call going the extra mile.\"KS \"Sean Baker has been the darling of awards season so far and should follow up his growing pile of wins with his first Oscar for Anora. But, The Substance is a film that takes you to places you never thought you would see, pushing the limits so far you will question your sanity (or Fargeat's). A fearless director, and the only woman to make it into the category this year, she deserves the win - and to become only the fourth woman in the Oscars' 97-year history to take home the prize.\"BM \"The Substance was not perfect; I felt Moore's character, Elisabeth Sparkle, was underdeveloped, and the ending was a little too much for me. Having said that, Fargeat's maximalist, stylised approach, with bold visuals and that pulsating, migraine-inducing score, genuinely made me feel - stress, mainly, and fearful anticipation for what was about to come. You are thinking about it long after it's finished. For that reason, I would give this one to Fargeat - although I would not be disappointed to see Baker win, either (and he probably will).\"GP Check the Sky News website from Sunday event to follow the entire event on our Oscars live blog"

        "Content": "\n          Arts and entertainment correspondent\n       Art has imitated life plenty of times at the Academy Awards but perhaps not quite as literally as it has for best picture nominee Conclave. Little did Ralph Fiennes and his co-stars know when they began filming in Rome two years ago, how real-world events would transpire to make the basic premise of this best picture nominee feel bizarrely prescient. This weekend, while the film industry comes together to recognise the great and the good in Hollywood, on the other side of the world cardinals have been gathering in Vatican City over concerns for the Pope's health. As one of its stars, John Lithgow, told reporters on the SAG Awards red carpet: \"The film has ended up extremely timely.\" While statistically winners are more likely to thank their agent or Steven Spielberg than God in their speeches, on-screen it's a different story this year. Films exploring issues around faith are unusually well represented. Perhaps most overtly through Conclave's Machiavellian cardinals but it's also explored in The Brutalist. We see the emotional toll on Adrien Brody's Jewish architect character when commissioned to build a Christian place of worship. Jesse Eissenberg's A Real Pain shows the changing role of faith plays for younger generations processing the Holocaust. \n                  Oscars 2025 predictions: Who will win and who should win?\n                 \n                  Oscars A-Z: From Anora to (a disqualified) Hans Zimmer\n                 \n                  Oscar nominees say cheese for the 2025 class photo - including Demi Moore, Ariana Grande, Timothee Chalamet and more\n                 As entertainment journalist Ronse Esangbedo explains: \"Religious films have had success at the Oscars but we don't see it often. \"I think people are yearning for more diversity of style of genre and we're seeing that more with each award show.\" Cynically while some might assume a renewed focus on events in Rome might put Conclave at a bit of an unfair advantage, in reality given that the voting deadline was 18 February - over a week before doctors said the Pope was in a critical but stable condition - it won't have swayed which film wins. While the Catholic Church arguably has greater concerns than whether a fictional take on the closed-door process of appointing a new pontiff wins an award, certainly the timing must be an irritant. To those who view the story as anti-Catholic propaganda, speaking at the end of last year, Fiennes insisted it isn't a \"facile takedown\" of Catholicism.  The best actor nominee told Sky News that for \"all churches but particularly the Catholic Church, the history… is full of very worldly motivations. \"There's obviously corruption… there's all kinds of transgressions that we know that have taken place… I think it's a big thing to open up and discuss.\" Read more:Oscars 2025 predictions: Who will win and who should win?Oscars A-Z: From Anora to a (disqualified) Hans ZimmerVatican issues update on Pope's healthOscar-winner Gene Hackman and wife found dead While Robert Harris' works have been translated into 40 languages - the popularity of Conclave in particular speaks to our fascination with a process we know so little about. Fiennes insists it's \"human\" how the cardinals in his film are seen positioning themselves for the top role. \"They're full of pride, ambition, things they've kept hidden and I think that's what's great [this film] is not cynical and that's what drew me to it.\"  Win or lose this weekend in Hollywood, Isabella Rossellini - who's nominated for best supporting actress for her brief role in the film - has been at pains to send her best wishes to Rome. \"We are very, very worried for our Pope,\" she told reporters at the SAG Awards virtual press room. \"We love this pope - Papa Francesco, Pope Francis. We wish him well. We wish him to recover.\""

The 46-year-old was accused of being violent towards Rebecca Hanson over an eight-year period. The charges were brought after he was arrested in June 2023. The TV auctioneer, from Mackworth, Derby, denied controlling or coercive behaviour spanning from 2015 to 2023, assault occasioning actual bodily harm, and assault by beating. The two assault charges related to incidents in 2015 and 2023. During the trial, Hanson claimed his wife had controlled him. He told the court he was \"almost a slave\" to her, saying she left him \"a beaten and broken man\" by controlling him and making him subservient towards her. She had claimed her husband was violent towards her and put her in a headlock in 2012, while she was pregnant with a baby she later lost.

The unnamed worker appears to cry and repeat \"damn\" as he says he can see Arakawa's body \"not moving\" from outside a window of the couple's New Mexico home. He urged the 911 call handler to \"send someone up here real quick\" as he said the house the couple were in was locked. Hackman, 95, Arakawa, 65, and one of their pet dogs were found dead on Wednesday after police carried out a welfare check. Two healthy dogs were also on the property. The actor's body was discovered in a mudroom while Arakawa was found in a bathroom next to a heater. Santa Fe sheriff Adan Mendoza told Sky's US partner network NBC that the couple may have been dead for \"a couple of weeks\". There were scattered pills and an open prescription bottle on a countertop near Arakawa, detectives from Santa Fe County Sheriff's Office wrote in a search warrant. \n                  Information from Gene Hackman's pacemaker suggests he died on 17 February, police say\n                 \n                  What we know about Gene Hackman and wife Betsy Arakawa's deaths - and why they're 'suspicious enough' to investigate\n                 \n                  Gene Hackman obituary: From Lex Luthor to Royal Tenenbaum, a reluctant celebrity who could turn his hand to any role\n                 Mr Mendoza said that the pills and prescription bottle was \"very important evidence\", and that other medications found in the house were \"something of concern\". The couple's deaths are \"suspicious enough in nature to require a thorough search and investigation\", the warrant said. There was no indication they had been shot and they had no other wounds, police said. One door to the property was found ajar with others unlocked, and there were no signs of forced entry. Read more: What we know about couple's death Preliminary findings from a medical investigation have found the couple suffered \"no external trauma\". Official results of post-mortem examinations and toxicology reports are pending, and the manner and cause of death have not yet been determined, according to the sheriff's office. Hackman's daughter had earlier suggested the couple may have been killed by carbon monoxide - but the cause of death remains unclear. The local utility company tested gas lines in and around the home after the bodies were found and did not find any sign of problems, the police warrant said. A fire bridge official later confirmed that they \"did not find anything in the home\" relating to a gas leak or carbon monoxide poisoning but said a leak could have dissipated. Tributes poured in for Hackman, who won an Oscar for his lead role in The French Connection, a 1971 action movie by William Friedkin, and another for best supporting actor in Clint Eastwood's 1992 western, Unforgiven. He was also known for playing Lex Luthor in the Superman films of the late 1970s and 1980s. Roles in the Francis Ford Coppola mystery thriller The Conversation and in the historical drama Mississippi Burning, where he starred as an FBI agent alongside Willem Dafoe, helped cement his career as one of Hollywood's greats. Among those paying tribute was the Prince of Wales, who said he was \"so sad to hear the news\". \"Hackman was a true genius of film who brought each and every character to life with power, authenticity and star quality,\" he said in a post on X. The Shawshank Redemption actor Morgan Freeman said \"bringing the French film Garde a Vue (Under Suspicion) to life with the incredibly gifted Gene Hackman\" was \"one of the personal highlights of my career\". The thriller, released in 2000, saw Hackman play wealthy tax lawyer Henry Hearst who is questioned by Freeman's character, Captain Victor Beneze, about the murder of a young girl. American filmmaker Francis Ford Coppola hailed Hackman as a \"great actor\" who was \"inspiring and magnificent in his work and complexity\". Coppola wrote and directed the Oscar-nominated 1974 mystery thriller The Conversation, which starred Hackman as a surveillance expert who has a crisis of conscience when he suspects the couple he is spying on will be murdered. Bill Murray, who starred with Hackman in the 2001 film The Tenenbaums, called him a \"tough nut\" and a \"really good\" actor.  Singer Sting said the world had \"lost a legend\" while actor and director Clint Eastwood said Hackman would be \"deeply missed\". Dirty Harry actor Eastwood starred opposite Hackman in 1997 political action thriller Absolute Power, where he played master jewel thief Luther Whitney. Hackman married Arakawa, a classical pianist, in 1991. He had three children, Christopher, Elizabeth Jean and Leslie Anne, with his late ex-wife, Faye Maltese, who died in 2017."
