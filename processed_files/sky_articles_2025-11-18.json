        "Content": " A bill that would force the US Justice Department to release all of its files on Jeffrey Epstein will be sent to the desk of Donald Trump after both houses of Congress gave it the all-clear. The House of Representatives was near unanimous in voting for the material to be released, with 427 in favour and one against. Epstein votes as they happened - catch up on the latest Hot on the heels of that vote, which was met with cheers in the chamber, the Senate said it too would pass the bill. \"As soon as it comes over from the House, we will pass the House's bill without changes, without delay, and we will finally get this done,\" said minority leader Chuck Schumer. Once the Republican-controlled Senate has formally transmitted the bill - set to happen on Wednesday, according to majority leader John Thune - it will go to Mr Trump for approval. Once the president signs it, the justice department has 30 days to release the files. How did we get here? Sky News US correspondent David Blevins said \"things are now moving very fast indeed\". \"It may be because of the scale of the result in the House,\" he explained. \"Or it may simply be because in the last few days, the president has sought to seize control of the narrative.\" Mr Trump has spent weeks decrying the Epstein files as a Democratic \"hoax\". His links to the disgraced financier, a convicted paedophile, have long been subject to scrutiny. The US president has always denied any wrongdoing. Speaking at the White House ahead of the vote on Tuesday, he said: \"I threw him out of my club many years ago because I thought he was a sick pervert and I guess I would turn out to be right.\" In a later post on his Truth Social platform, he said he doesn't care when the Senate passes the bill.  His change of heart on releasing the files came as a surprise over the weekend, as he called on Republicans in Congress to vote for the so-called Epstein Files Bill. The issue has proved to be a major source of division within Mr Trump's Make America Great Again movement. 'Time to see who is listening' Marjorie Taylor Greene, a long-time Trump backer who publicly fell out with the president just days ago, stood with Epstein survivors on the steps of the Capitol on Tuesday afternoon. She said: \"These women have fought the most horrific fight that no woman should have to fight. And they did it by banding together and never giving up. \"That's what we did by fighting so hard against the most powerful people in the world, even the president of the United States, in order to make this vote happen today.\" One of the group, Liz Stein, added: \"We have told our stories over and over and over. Now it's time to see who is listening. We ask that you vote to release the files. All of them.\"  Tap here to follow Trump100 wherever you get your podcasts Tuesday's votes followed the release of thousands of files related to Epstein as part of an investigation by Congress' House Oversight Committee. Emails, messages, photos and other documents released in recent weeks have included references to Mr Trump, the UK's since sacked US ambassador Lord Mandelson, and former British prince Andrew Mountbatten Windsor, who has faced calls from members of the committee to give evidence.

        "Content": " Scotland secured a place at the men's World Cup for the first time since 1998 as stoppage-time goals by Kieran Tierney and Kenny McLean secured a thrilling 4-2 win over Denmark at Hampden Park.  Scott McTominay's spectacular third-minute bicycle kick had given the hosts a half-time lead. Rasmus Hojlund equalised for the Danes in the 57th minute shortly before Rasmus Kristensen was sent off, but Lawrence Shankland restored Scotland's advantage. When Patrick Dorgu brought Denmark level again with nine minutes remaining, it seemed they would claim the point needed to top the group and book their place at next year's tournament in the US, Canada, and Mexico. However, Tierney fired an unstoppable shot past Kasper Schmeichel in the third minute of stoppage time And then, with the Denmark goalkeeper up in attack at the other end of the pitch, McLean hit a long-range effort from his own half to spark delirious scenes.

He told the BBC: \"We certainly put the country through it, but I'm sure it will be worth it.\" \"I couldn't get my mate Diogo Jota out of my head today,\" he added.

        "Content": "\n          Reporter\n              @ClaireGilbodyD\n The best and worst delivery companies have been revealed in new research by Citizens Advice. According to a survey carried out for the report, a record 15 million people experienced a problem with their latest delivery - more than one in three of those surveyed. Yodel came last in a league table compiled by the charity, with a score of two out of five stars. Royal Mail scored the highest at 3.25 out of five stars. Amazon Logistics came second with three stars, followed by DPD and Evri, which both got 2.25. Citizens Advice's league table measured the companies' performance based on customer service, delivery issues and how well they met accessibility needs. The most common issues people faced with their last delivery included the driver leaving before they had time to get to the door (29%), their parcel being left in an insecure location (24%), and parcels arriving late (24%). The charity pointed to regulator Ofcom introducing guidance on complaints and accessibility in 2023, but said its research showed many parcel firms were still \"ignoring the rules\". 'Tougher action needed' Dame Clare Moriarty, chief executive of Citizens Advice, said: \"We continue to see millions of people chasing lost parcels, having their accessibility needs ignored and hitting a brick wall when they try to complain. \"The question now is whether the regulator will take tougher action to improve the parcel market once and for all.\" In response, Ofcom said in a statement to Sky News: \"We have a strong track record of holding parcel firms to account on behalf of the public. \"That has involved tracking people's experiences of parcel deliveries for over a decade, and, as a result, introducing strengthened regulations on parcel firms in 2023. \"Under these rules, postal operators must have a simple and transparent complaints process in place, and have clear and effective policies and procedures for the fair treatment of disabled customers. \"While overall satisfaction is reasonably high at 78%, people's experiences can vary depending on which parcel company delivers their package, and we're continuing to press operators to make further improvements. \"We'll also continue to work with Citizens Advice - as the statutory consumer advocate for post - to achieve our shared goal of ensuring consumers receive a reliable service, whichever company is used.\"  Accessibility found to be the worst performing area Mike, in his 70s, has muscular dystrophy and relies on two walking sticks. He has asked delivery firms not to leave parcels at his front door as he struggles to get there in time. He instead asks them to deliver to his back door, which is closer to his home office and easier for him to reach. But Citizens Advice says companies ignore his requests. It results in parcels often being misdelivered or left exposed to the weather. Read more from Sky News:Number of Britons leaving the UK higher than previously thoughtWhy is flu season set to be worse this year? \"It makes you awfully frustrated, and it makes you really fed up, to the point that I'm beginning to stop buying from retailers that use certain delivery companies,\" Mike said. \"I had one delivery agent chuck a parcel over the back gate on to the concrete floor, who said he'd handed it to the resident. I had the video showing him throwing it over the back gate then taking a picture saying he'd delivered it.\" What have the delivery companies said in response?  Amazon: \"Every day at Amazon, incredible employees and independent delivery partners come together to provide fast, reliable and safe delivery for our customers. \"The vast majority of deliveries make it to customers without issue. In the rare case something occurs, we work with customers directly to make it right.\" Royal Mail: \"We are pleased Royal Mail came first in the Citizens Advice parcels league table for the fourth year running. \"Since last year, we've made great strides in providing customers with the most convenient options for sending, returning and collecting parcels. \"Aside from delivering to every home in the UK, we offer the UK's largest out-of-home network including shops, lockers and parcel post boxes, all introduced to ensure we're the nearest and simplest choice for our customers.\" Evri: \"Every parcel matters, and it is great to receive independent recognition from Citizens Advice of the progress we are already making on service. \"This comes at a time when we have grown significantly in scale to deliver over 900 million parcels a year and follows sustained investments of £57m in operations and technology supporting service improvements over the past 12 months. \"That said, we have further improvements planned and know we have more to do. \"By listening to feedback and investing in the right tools, systems, and training, we have been able to make tangible improvements for our customers as we remain focused on building further trust and consistency across each delivery. \"We are also the only UK parcel carrier to commit to accessibility improvements and since we partnered with disability equality charity Scope in October 2024 improvements include enhanced doorstep and website delivery options, with 90,000 customers already setting accessibility preferences on their Evri account.\" Yodel and DPD did not respond to requests for comment from Sky News. Citizens Advice said between August and September, Opinium Research conducted an online survey of 8,000 adults who received a parcel in the last month from Royal Mail, DPD, Yodel, Amazon Logistics or Evri. The data was weighted to be nationally representative of those that had received a parcel from one of those five companies in the last month."

        "Content": "\n          Education reporter\n       Actor Anna Maxwell Martin and a group of parents have warned that primary school tests have \"devastating effects\" for children with special educational needs and disabilities (SEND). They have written an open letter to the government asking ministers to consider reforming SATs (standard assessment tests) to accommodate the youngsters' needs. The 22 parent groups say the system is damaging for children with SEND and they want to see a more inclusive approach which incorporates the needs of the individual child. The letter to Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson said the current system \"actively harms\" children with SEND, leaving them often disengaged from school as they move on to secondary school. Maxwell Martin, who has starred in TV comedy Motherland and police drama Line Of Duty, said: \"The government needs to look much harder at how to make things better for children in schools, particularly children with SEND. \"This is a systemic failing within our assessment system, not the fault of any individual teacher or headteacher.\" What has research found? \n                  AI to tackle truancy by setting school attendance targets\n                 \n                  Ofsted launches new school report card system\n                 \n                  Biggest schools shake-up in England in a decade to cut GCSE exam time - and add AI and fake news lessons\n                 Research by the SEND parent group said only 24% of SEND children passed the SATs, and 67% of SEND children did not want to attend school because of them. Half of the parents questioned also said their child's self-esteem was damaged, and they believed SATs would have a lasting negative impact. 'Change the system' The letter to Ms Phillipson said: \"Forcing children into a system that actively harms them is not the answer. Changing the system so that our children want to attend is.\" But some think SATs do not serve any child. Lee Parkinson MBE, a primary school teacher and education consultant from Manchester, said SATs are a negative process for all children, not just children with SEND. He told Sky News: \"SATs don't serve any child, let alone those with SEND. They were never designed to support learning.\" He called the tests a \"blunt accountability tool, a stick to beat schools with, rather than something that helps teachers understand children\". 'Speed rewarded over understanding' Mr Parkinson claimed SATs were \"built to catch pupils out. They reward speed over understanding and memorisation over genuine thinking\". \"That alone disadvantages huge numbers of children, but for pupils with SEND the gap becomes a chasm. Processing speed, anxiety, sensory needs, working memory difficulties, language disorders… none of these are accounted for in a system that measures every child by the same stopwatch and mark scheme.\" Mr Parkinson added: \"For many SEND pupils, success in school looks like communication gains, emotional regulation, confidence, independence and steady academic growth in a way that matches their needs. \"SATs don't measure any of that. Instead, they label, limit and distort the reality of what progress actually looks like for the children who need thoughtful, personalised provision the most.\" The open letter also said children with SEND who failed SATs \"spend their entire year 6 convinced they are not clever enough\". Read more:How children with SEND from poorer families left behindMPs want overhaul of school support for special needs pupils 'Urgent need for rethink' Sarah Hannafin, head of policy at school leaders' union NAHT, said there is an \"urgent need\" for the government to rethink the value of SATs. \"If statutory tests are here to stay, they must be designed to be accessible for the vast majority of pupils, they should recognise the attainment and progress of all children, and they should not damage children's confidence or cause distress,\" she said. What does the government say? A Department for Education spokesperson said: \"Primary tests and assessments play a vital role in helping schools ensure every pupil can achieve and thrive, while also identifying those who need additional support.\" \"The government's independent, expert-led Curriculum and Assessment Review panel shaped key recommendations aimed at improving our national curriculum, and included key insights from SEND experts. \"We are actively working with parents and experts to improve support for children with SEND, including through more early intervention to prevent needs from escalating and investing £740 million to encourage councils to create more specialist places in mainstream schools.\""

We know what you are doing, and in ministers' words today we \"won't stand for it\". But in the wake of the collapsed China spying case last month, the security services also want to reestablish a badly dented sense of deterrence. Politics latest: China responds to MI5's spy warning to MPs  That case against two British men accused of spying for Beijing fell apart because officials would not use the words \"enemy\" or \"national security threat\" to describe China. The failure projected a sense of weakness in the face of Chinese espionage efforts, something the government is keen to dispel. Those efforts remain persistent and dangerous, security officials insist. China has always aggressively sought the official and commercial secrets of Western nations. It regards that mission as a patriotic duty, an essential part of a national project to catch up with and then overtake the West. In the words of Britain's security minister, Dan Jarvis, on Tuesday, China seeks \"to interfere in our sovereign affairs in favour of its own interests\". Read more:Parliamentarians warned of spying attempts from China agents Indeed, much of China's technological and economic progress was, until recently, built on intellectual property stolen from rival nations. Its private sector has been notorious for ripping off and reverse engineering Western know-how, pilfered from joint venture partners or through commercial espionage. 👉 Click here to listen to Electoral Dysfunction on your podcast app 👈 Intelligence agencies say the Chinese have also hoovered up vast amounts of personal data from all of us through social media platforms like TikTok and other methods, collecting in bulk for now, for sifting and harvesting later. Officially, the Chinese government denies all these allegations. It has to be said that Western spies are also hard at work snooping on China. But critics say Western nations have been naive and too trusting of the Chinese threat. While the British government remains unsure whether to identify China as an enemy or simply a commercial rival, an ambivalence remains, which Beijing will continue doing its best to exploit."

        "Content": " The wife of murdered Saudi Arabian journalist Jamal Khashoggi says \"zero justice\" has been served over her husband's death. Mr Khashoggi, a strident critic of the kingdom, was slain by Saudi agents in an operation in Istanbul in 2018, and American intelligence agencies concluded Mohammed bin Salman had ordered his capture or killing. The crown prince has denied ordering the operation, but acknowledged responsibility as Riyadh's de-facto ruler. He was hosted at the White House on Tuesday for the first time in seven years, and Donald Trump defended him and cast doubt upon his own country's assessments.  Mr Trump derided Mr Khashoggi as \"extremely controversial\" and said \"a lot of people didn't like that gentleman\". Hanan Khashoggi told Sky News' The World With Yalda Hakim she was \"disappointed\" by the remarks, as she demanded compensation from the crown prince. He has described the killing of her husband as a \"huge mistake\". Addressing Mr Trump directly, Ms Khashoggi said she would be willing to meet the US president to tell him about the Washington Post writer, who she said was \"a great man, and a professional, and he was a brave man as well\". 'They destroyed my life' Ms Khashoggi said her husband was not controversial or unlikeable - but even if he was, \"it doesn't justify the action of kidnapping him, torturing him, killing him and dismantling his body\". She also said she would meet the crown prince and \"ask him to retrieve Jamal's body, so I can bury him in a decent, good way\", as well as ask for financial compensation. \"They killed my husband, they destroyed my life,\" she added. \"They have to compensate me.\" Trump defends MBS Asked about the murder in the Oval Office, Mr Trump said: \"Whether you like him or didn't like him, things happen. \"But he (Bin Salman) knew nothing about it, and we can leave it at that. \"You don't have to embarrass our guest by asking a question like that.\"  Mr Trump even celebrated the Saudi leader for the kingdom's human rights record, without providing specific details. \"I'm very proud of the job he's done,\" he said. Human rights groups say Saudi authorities continue to harshly repress dissent by arresting human rights defenders, journalists and political dissidents. They also highlight a surge in executions in Saudi Arabia they connect to an effort to suppress internal dissent. The crown prince announced Saudi Arabia was increasing its planned investments in the US to $1trn, up from the $600bn the Saudis announced they would pour into the US when Mr Trump visited the kingdom in May."

Miles Cross, 33, admitted four counts of intentionally doing an act capable of encouraging or assisting the suicide of another.Cross provided chemicals to Shubhreet Singh on 22 August last year, Wrexham Magistrates' Court heard during an October hearing.Ms Singh, 26, died in West Yorkshire last year.The three other counts relate to three victims who are alive and cannot be named due to reporting restrictions.The incidents are said to have happened in August and September 2024.Police are also investigating a second death in connection with the packages Cross sold online. Cross had set up a business selling the chemical via an internet discussion forum and interacted with others on the forum under a pseudonym.He joined the site in July 2024 and posted a QR code, which allowed people to order the chemical directly from him and pay via his bank account.Cross received payments of £100 from four people and sent them the chemical through the post.Cross, from Wrexham, was arrested in January following a police investigation into sales via the forum to assist with suicide. Officers found the chemical and other paraphernalia at his address.His devices were seized, which linked Cross to the forum, social media profiles and the bank account. \"Miles Cross preyed on four people in a distressed state and knowingly provided a substance intended to end their lives,\" Alison Storey, specialist prosecutor with the CPS Special Crime Division, said. \"His actions were purely for financial gain, and he made the process of ordering the chemical online easy and accessible.\" She said the case was a \"stark reminder of the dangers posed by those who aim to exploit vulnerable individuals online\", adding that the CPS hopes that Cross pleading guilty brings \"some measure of justice\" to the victims and their families.

Hamas condemned the strike, saying: \"The claims and allegations of the Zionist occupation army that the targeted location is a 'training compound belonging to the movement' are pure fabrication and lies, aimed at justifying its criminal aggression.\" It said the strike targeted an open sports field used by residents of the camp, adding there were no military establishments in refugee camps in Lebanon. 👉 Tap here to follow The World with Richard Engel and Yalda Hakim wherever you get your podcasts 👈 The Israeli army said it would continue to act against the group wherever it operated.

        "Content": "A man who allegedly tried to murder his ex-partner ended up killing her sister and her three children in a house fire, a trial has heard. Prosecutors told a jury that Sharaz Ali was \"motivated by jealousy and fuelled by drink and drugs\" when he set fire to Bryonie Gawith's home early on 21 August last year. Jurors heard that Ali went to the property, on Westbury Road, Bradford, aiming to \"take revenge\" on his ex, Antonia Gawith, who was staying there after ending their \"abusive\" seven-year relationship earlier that month. Ali and his associate, Calum Sunderland, forced their way into the home before Ali poured petrol around inside and set it alight, Doncaster Crown Court was told. Antonia Gawith managed to escape, but Bryonie Gawith, 29, and her children Denisty Birtle, nine, Oscar Birtle, five, and 22-month-old Aubree Birtle died in the fire. Ali, 40, of no fixed address, and Sunderland, 26, of Keighley, are charged with murdering the family as well as attempting to murder Antonia Gawith. Mohammed Shabir, 45, who had been due to go on trial with them, died of a heart attack last month after collapsing in jail. Prosecutor David Brooke KC said the men drove from Keighley to Bradford just before 2am, stopping to buy a seven-litre can of petrol on the journey. He told jurors that Ali was captured on ring doorbell footage telling Sunderland, who was carrying the petrol and a lighter, to \"kick the door in\", which he did before running back to the car.

Mr Brooke said Ali went inside the house and poured petrol on Antonia Gawith. Antonia saw Bryonie, who had woken up, kick Ali as he was walking up the stairs, the court heard. Mr Brooke said: \"She (Antonia) managed to wrestle the container from him but he lit the lighter and a fire started including himself, the stairs and her sister. \"She ended up outside the closed front door and was then unable to get back inside. \"She ran around the back of the house but the back door had been jamming and she couldn't get it open despite her kicking it.\" Footage played in court showed Shabir and Sunderland driving away before the fire \"exploded into life\". The court heard that as Antonia was at the back of the house, her sister called 999. The trial was told that when police arrived six minutes later, flames were engulfing the front of the house, and it was too late to save Bryonie and the children. Mr Brooke said: \"Sharaz Ali was himself caught by his own actions and was later pulled out of the house by the police badly injured.\" The prosecutor also said: \"The main mover in what happened was plainly Sharaz Ali. \"Motivated by jealousy and fuelled by drink and drugs it is obvious that he decided to take revenge on his ex-partner Antonia regardless of the potential consequences for others.\" Ali and Sunderland deny the charges and the trial continues."

Sir Keir has sought to keep relationships with Beijing somewhat warm, highlighting the value of China as a trading partner. As part of their reaction to the latest spying attempt, Mr Jarvis announced a slew of new security measures. This includes new investment in sovereign encryption technology, the removal of surveillance equipment manufactured in China, and investment in UK resilience against state-based threats. Mr Jarvis said that the government would use all its tools - including sanctions - if necessary against China, mentioning \"proscription-type tool\" to disrupt proxy organisations. He also said a closed-door meeting would take place with university leaders to warn them about potential influence in the sector. But Mr Jarvis confirmed the government will continue to trade with China, and did not say if the nation would be added to the enhanced tier of the Foreign Influence Registration Scheme (FIRS). He said no decision has been made yet on this area."

We know what you are doing, and in ministers' words today we \"won't stand for it\". But in the wake of the collapsed China spying case last month, the security services also want to reestablish a badly dented sense of deterrence. Politics latest: China responds to MI5's spy warning to MPs  That case against two British men accused of spying for Beijing fell apart because officials would not use the words \"enemy\" or \"national security threat\" to describe China. The failure projected a sense of weakness in the face of Chinese espionage efforts, something the government is keen to dispel. Those efforts remain persistent and dangerous, security officials insist. China has always aggressively sought the official and commercial secrets of Western nations. It regards that mission as a patriotic duty, an essential part of a national project to catch up with and then overtake the West. In the words of Britain's security minister, Dan Jarvis, on Tuesday, China seeks \"to interfere in our sovereign affairs in favour of its own interests\".

But critics say Western nations have been naive and too trusting of the Chinese threat.

        "Content": "\n          Reporter\n              @ClaireGilbodyD\n The best and worst delivery companies have been revealed in new research by Citizens Advice. According to a survey carried out for the report, a record 15 million people experienced a problem with their latest delivery - more than one in three of those surveyed. Yodel came last in a league table compiled by the charity, with a score of two out of five stars. Royal Mail scored the highest at 3.25 out of five stars. Amazon Logistics came second with three stars, followed by DPD and Evri, which both got 2.25. Citizens Advice's league table measured the companies' performance based on customer service, delivery issues and how well they met accessibility needs. The most common issues people faced with their last delivery included the driver leaving before they had time to get to the door (29%), their parcel being left in an insecure location (24%), and parcels arriving late (24%). The charity pointed to regulator Ofcom introducing guidance on complaints and accessibility in 2023, but said its research showed many parcel firms were still \"ignoring the rules\". 'Tougher action needed' Dame Clare Moriarty, chief executive of Citizens Advice, said: \"We continue to see millions of people chasing lost parcels, having their accessibility needs ignored and hitting a brick wall when they try to complain. \"The question now is whether the regulator will take tougher action to improve the parcel market once and for all.\" In response, Ofcom said in a statement to Sky News: \"We have a strong track record of holding parcel firms to account on behalf of the public. \"That has involved tracking people's experiences of parcel deliveries for over a decade, and, as a result, introducing strengthened regulations on parcel firms in 2023. \"Under these rules, postal operators must have a simple and transparent complaints process in place, and have clear and effective policies and procedures for the fair treatment of disabled customers. \"While overall satisfaction is reasonably high at 78%, people's experiences can vary depending on which parcel company delivers their package, and we're continuing to press operators to make further improvements. \"We'll also continue to work with Citizens Advice - as the statutory consumer advocate for post - to achieve our shared goal of ensuring consumers receive a reliable service, whichever company is used.\"  Accessibility found to be the worst performing area Mike, in his 70s, has muscular dystrophy and relies on two walking sticks. He has asked delivery firms not to leave parcels at his front door as he struggles to get there in time. He instead asks them to deliver to his back door, which is closer to his home office and easier for him to reach. But Citizens Advice says companies ignore his requests. It results in parcels often being misdelivered or left exposed to the weather. Read more from Sky News:Number of Britons leaving the UK higher than previously thoughtWhy is flu season set to be worse this year? \"It makes you awfully frustrated, and it makes you really fed up, to the point that I'm beginning to stop buying from retailers that use certain delivery companies,\" Mike said. \"I had one delivery agent chuck a parcel over the back gate on to the concrete floor, who said he'd handed it to the resident. I had the video showing him throwing it over the back gate then taking a picture saying he'd delivered it.\" What have the delivery companies said in response?  Amazon: \"Every day at Amazon, incredible employees and independent delivery partners come together to provide fast, reliable and safe delivery for our customers. \"The vast majority of deliveries make it to customers without issue. In the rare case something occurs, we work with customers directly to make it right.\" Royal Mail: \"We are pleased Royal Mail came first in the Citizens Advice parcels league table for the fourth year running. \"Since last year, we've made great strides in providing customers with the most convenient options for sending, returning and collecting parcels. \"Aside from delivering to every home in the UK, we offer the UK's largest out-of-home network including shops, lockers and parcel post boxes, all introduced to ensure we're the nearest and simplest choice for our customers.\" Evri: \"Every parcel matters, and it is great to receive independent recognition from Citizens Advice of the progress we are already making on service. \"This comes at a time when we have grown significantly in scale to deliver over 900 million parcels a year and follows sustained investments of £57m in operations and technology supporting service improvements over the past 12 months. \"That said, we have further improvements planned and know we have more to do. \"By listening to feedback and investing in the right tools, systems, and training, we have been able to make tangible improvements for our customers as we remain focused on building further trust and consistency across each delivery. \"We are also the only UK parcel carrier to commit to accessibility improvements and since we partnered with disability equality charity Scope in October 2024 improvements include enhanced doorstep and website delivery options, with 90,000 customers already setting accessibility preferences on their Evri account.\" Yodel and DPD did not respond to requests for comment from Sky News. Citizens Advice said between August and September, Opinium Research conducted an online survey of 8,000 adults who received a parcel in the last month from Royal Mail, DPD, Yodel, Amazon Logistics or Evri. The data was weighted to be nationally representative of those that had received a parcel from one of those five companies in the last month."

Miles Cross, 33, admitted four counts of intentionally doing an act capable of encouraging or assisting the suicide of another.Cross provided chemicals to Shubhreet Singh on 22 August last year, Wrexham Magistrates' Court heard during an October hearing.Ms Singh, 26, died in West Yorkshire last year.The three other counts relate to three victims who are alive and cannot be named due to reporting restrictions.The incidents are said to have happened in August and September 2024.Police are also investigating a second death in connection with the packages Cross sold online. Cross had set up a business selling the chemical via an internet discussion forum and interacted with others on the forum under a pseudonym.He joined the site in July 2024 and posted a QR code, which allowed people to order the chemical directly from him and pay via his bank account.Cross received payments of £100 from four people and sent them the chemical through the post.Cross, from Wrexham, was arrested in January following a police investigation into sales via the forum to assist with suicide. Officers found the chemical and other paraphernalia at his address.His devices were seized, which linked Cross to the forum, social media profiles and the bank account. \"Miles Cross preyed on four people in a distressed state and knowingly provided a substance intended to end their lives,\" Alison Storey, specialist prosecutor with the CPS Special Crime Division, said. \"His actions were purely for financial gain, and he made the process of ordering the chemical online easy and accessible.\" She said the case was a \"stark reminder of the dangers posed by those who aim to exploit vulnerable individuals online\", adding that the CPS hopes that Cross pleading guilty brings \"some measure of justice\" to the victims and their families. North Wales Police's Detective Superintendent Chris Bell said: \"Cross took advantage and exploited his victims in their most desperate moments, profiting off their vulnerability and mental illnesses. \"I hope today's admission provides the victims and their families with some peace of mind and relief that they are now spared the ordeal of a trial.

        "Content": "\n          Royal correspondent\n              @SkyRhiannon\n The Princess of Wales has delivered a rare speech calling on businesses to value \"time and tenderness just as much as productivity and success\", as part of her push to make society put the needs of children first.  During her first speech since she was diagnosed with cancer at the start of 2024, Kate reflected on the importance of love, telling 80 business leaders, \"the love we feel in our earliest years fundamentally shapes who we become and how we thrive as adults\". But in a call to action for businesses, she added: \"Every one of you interacts with your own environment; a home, a family, a business, a workforce, a community. These are the ecosystems that you yourselves help to weave. \"Imagine a world where each of these environments were built on valuing time and tenderness just as much as productivity and success. \"As business leaders, you will face the daily challenge of finding the balance between profitability and having a positive impact. But the two are not, and should not be incompatible.\" At the Future Workforce Summit, hosted by her Royal Foundation Business Taskforce, Kate thanked her team at the Centre of Early Childhood \"for holding the fort, particularly over the last couple of years\". She was also joined by former England manager Sir Gareth Southgate as she called on business leaders to invest more in the early years development of children.

But while the survey found that 81% of business leaders believe there will be an increased need for human skills in the next five to 10 years, very few business leaders identified the unique importance of early childhood in the development of these skills. In summer 2024, the Royal Foundation Business Taskforce for Early Childhood produced a report recommending a range of interventions from creating a culture inside and outside firms that prioritises childhood to supporting parents with greater resources and flexibility in the workplace. Involving the chief executives of Ikea, NatWest Group and Deloitte, the report highlighted how the nation could benefit from an estimated £45.5bn. The report followed the launch of Kate's long-term campaign, Shaping Us, in January 2023, described as the princess' \"life's work\", and aimed at highlighting the crucial first five years of a child's life."

        "Content": "\n          Education reporter\n       Actor Anna Maxwell Martin and a group of parents have warned that primary school tests have \"devastating effects\" for children with special educational needs and disabilities (SEND). They have written an open letter to the government asking ministers to consider reforming SATs (standard assessment tests) to accommodate the youngsters' needs. The 22 parent groups say the system is damaging for children with SEND and they want to see a more inclusive approach which incorporates the needs of the individual child. The letter to Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson said the current system \"actively harms\" children with SEND, leaving them often disengaged from school as they move on to secondary school. Maxwell Martin, who has starred in TV comedy Motherland and police drama Line Of Duty, said: \"The government needs to look much harder at how to make things better for children in schools, particularly children with SEND. \"This is a systemic failing within our assessment system, not the fault of any individual teacher or headteacher.\" What has research found? \n                  AI to tackle truancy by setting school attendance targets\n                 \n                  Ofsted launches new school report card system\n                 \n                  Biggest schools shake-up in England in a decade to cut GCSE exam time - and add AI and fake news lessons\n                 Research by the SEND parent group said only 24% of SEND children passed the SATs, and 67% of SEND children did not want to attend school because of them. Half of the parents questioned also said their child's self-esteem was damaged, and they believed SATs would have a lasting negative impact. 'Change the system' The letter to Ms Phillipson said: \"Forcing children into a system that actively harms them is not the answer. Changing the system so that our children want to attend is.\" But some think SATs do not serve any child. Lee Parkinson MBE, a primary school teacher and education consultant from Manchester, said SATs are a negative process for all children, not just children with SEND. He told Sky News: \"SATs don't serve any child, let alone those with SEND. They were never designed to support learning.\" He called the tests a \"blunt accountability tool, a stick to beat schools with, rather than something that helps teachers understand children\". 'Speed rewarded over understanding' Mr Parkinson claimed SATs were \"built to catch pupils out. They reward speed over understanding and memorisation over genuine thinking\". \"That alone disadvantages huge numbers of children, but for pupils with SEND the gap becomes a chasm. Processing speed, anxiety, sensory needs, working memory difficulties, language disorders… none of these are accounted for in a system that measures every child by the same stopwatch and mark scheme.\" Mr Parkinson added: \"For many SEND pupils, success in school looks like communication gains, emotional regulation, confidence, independence and steady academic growth in a way that matches their needs. \"SATs don't measure any of that. Instead, they label, limit and distort the reality of what progress actually looks like for the children who need thoughtful, personalised provision the most.\" The open letter also said children with SEND who failed SATs \"spend their entire year 6 convinced they are not clever enough\". Read more:How children with SEND from poorer families left behindMPs want overhaul of school support for special needs pupils 'Urgent need for rethink' Sarah Hannafin, head of policy at school leaders' union NAHT, said there is an \"urgent need\" for the government to rethink the value of SATs. \"If statutory tests are here to stay, they must be designed to be accessible for the vast majority of pupils, they should recognise the attainment and progress of all children, and they should not damage children's confidence or cause distress,\" she said. What does the government say? A Department for Education spokesperson said: \"Primary tests and assessments play a vital role in helping schools ensure every pupil can achieve and thrive, while also identifying those who need additional support.\" \"The government's independent, expert-led Curriculum and Assessment Review panel shaped key recommendations aimed at improving our national curriculum, and included key insights from SEND experts. \"We are actively working with parents and experts to improve support for children with SEND, including through more early intervention to prevent needs from escalating and investing £740 million to encourage councils to create more specialist places in mainstream schools.\""

Ms Sultana's event has prompted speculation of a de-facto leadership bid, ahead of a battle for the top job expected in the new year. Members will vote on the leadership model at the conference, beginning officially on 29 November, but the idea proposed in the party's draft constitution is for a single leader rather than a co-leader model. Independent MPs Mr Corbyn and Ms Sultana are yet to say if they will stand for the leadership, though both are widely expected to. The speakers at Ms Sultana's event are figures seen as close to the Coventry South MP and her vision for the party, including Mish Rahman, a former Labour NEC member who is now active in the Democratic Bloc group. Dembloc is a grassroots group of would-be Your Party members who have pushed for activists to have more say in Your Party. They have regularly tweeted in support of Ms Sultana and she spoke at an event they hosted on Monday night.

It follows months of factionalism and infighting at the heart of what promised to be a major moment for the British left but has so far been dominated by rows over leadership, finances and even its name. This has broadly involved two factions - those close to Mr Corbyn who have worked with the former Labour leader for many years, and those close to Ms Sultana who see her as a fresh face for the British left. Your Party says it has 50,000 paid members - but only a fraction will be able to attend the conference after being chosen through a sortition."

We know what you are doing, and in ministers' words today we \"won't stand for it\". But in the wake of the collapsed China spying case last month, the security services also want to reestablish a badly dented sense of deterrence. Politics latest: China responds to MI5's spy warning to MPs  That case against two British men accused of spying for Beijing fell apart because officials would not use the words \"enemy\" or \"national security threat\" to describe China. The failure projected a sense of weakness in the face of Chinese espionage efforts, something the government is keen to dispel. Those efforts remain persistent and dangerous, security officials insist. China has always aggressively sought the official and commercial secrets of Western nations. It regards that mission as a patriotic duty, an essential part of a national project to catch up with and then overtake the West. In the words of Britain's security minister, Dan Jarvis, on Tuesday, China seeks \"to interfere in our sovereign affairs in favour of its own interests\".

Officially, the Chinese government denies all these allegations. It has to be said that Western spies are also hard at work snooping on China. But critics say Western nations have been naive and too trusting of the Chinese threat. While the British government remains unsure whether to identify China as an enemy or simply a commercial rival, an ambivalence remains, which Beijing will continue doing its best to exploit."

        "Content": " Mass killings and millions forced to flee for their lives have made Sudan the \"epicentre of suffering in the world\", according to the UN's humanitarian affairs chief. About 12 million people are believed to have been displaced and at least 40,000 killed in the civil war - but aid groups say the true death toll could be far greater. Tom Fletcher, the UN's under-secretary-general for humanitarian affairs, told Sky's The World With Yalda Hakim the situation was \"horrifying\". \"It's utterly grim right now - it's the epicentre of suffering in the world,\" he said of Sudan. The war between the Sudanese army and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) - who were once allies - started in Khartoum in April 2023 but has spread across the country. The fighting has inflicted almost unimaginable misery on a nation that was already suffering a humanitarian crisis. Famine has been declared in some areas and Mr Fletcher said there was a \"sense of rampant brutality and impunity\" in the east African nation. \"I spoke to so many people who told me stories of mass executions, mass rape, sexual violence being weaponised as part of the conflict,\" he said. The fall of a key city Last month, the RSF captured Al Fashir - the capital of North Darfur state - after a siege of more than 18 months. Hundreds have been killed and tens of thousands forced to flee, according to the UN and aid groups.  The World Health Organisation said more than 450 people alone were reportedly killed at a maternity hospital in the city. RSF fighters also went house to house to murder civilians and carried out sexual assault and rape, according to aid workers and displaced people. The journey to escape Al Fashir goes through areas with no access to food, water or medical help - and Mr Fletcher said people had described to him the \"horrors\" of trying to make it out. \"One woman [was] carrying her dead neighbour's malnourished child - and then she herself was attacked on the road as she fled towards Tawila,\" he told Sky News.  Such is the violence in Al Fashir, blood from mass killings appears to stain the sand in satellite images from Yale's Humanitarian Research Lab, Mr Fletcher added. \"We've got to make sure there are teams going in to investigate these atrocities. Al Fashir is a crime scene right now,\" he said. \"But we've also got to make sure we've got protection for civilians from the future atrocities.\" Children at the forefront of suffering Mr Fletcher told Yalda Hakim that children had \"borne the brunt\" and made up one in five of those killed in Al Fashir. He said a child he met \"recoiled from me\" and \"flinched\" when he gestured towards a Manchester City logo on his shirt when they were kicking a ball around. \"This is a six-year-old, so what has he seen and experienced to be that terrified of other people?\" he asked. He's urging the international community to boost funding to help civilians, and a \"much more vigorous, energised diplomacy\" to try to end the fighting. \"This can't be so complex, so difficult, that the world can't fix it,\" he told Sky News. \"And we've seen some momentum. We've seen the quad - Egypt, America, Saudi, the UAE just recently - getting more engaged. \"I'm in daily contact with them all, including the White House envoy, Dr Massad Boulos, but we need to sustain that diplomatic engagement and show the creativity and patience that's needed.\" Read more:Genocide unfolding in Darfur, warns Sudanese government'Tens of thousands killed in two days' in Sudan city  Hopes of an imminent end to the violence currently look unlikely. Sudan's military leader, General Abdel-Fattah Burhan, said on Friday that his forces would not stop until the RSF is wiped out. \"This war will not come to an end with a truce, but when rebels are destroyed,\" he said - according to a statement from Sudan's ruling council. \"We call on all Sudanese to join the fight, and for those who can carry weapons to come forward.\" The RSF and the Sudanese army have previously agreed to various ceasefire proposals during their two-and-a-half-year-old war, but none have succeeded."

She also said she would meet the crown prince and \"ask him to retrieve Jamal's body, so I can bury him in a decent, good way\", as well as ask for financial compensation. \"They killed my husband, they destroyed my life,\" she added. \"They have to compensate me.\" Trump defends MBS Asked about the murder in the Oval Office, Mr Trump said: \"Whether you like him or didn't like him, things happen. \"But he (Bin Salman) knew nothing about it, and we can leave it at that. \"You don't have to embarrass our guest by asking a question like that.\"  Mr Trump even celebrated the Saudi leader for the kingdom's human rights record, without providing specific details. \"I'm very proud of the job he's done,\" he said. Human rights groups say Saudi authorities continue to harshly repress dissent by arresting human rights defenders, journalists and political dissidents. They also highlight a surge in executions in Saudi Arabia they connect to an effort to suppress internal dissent. The crown prince announced Saudi Arabia was increasing its planned investments in the US to $1trn, up from the $600bn the Saudis announced they would pour into the US when Mr Trump visited the kingdom in May."

        "Content": "\n          Middle East correspondent\n              @adamparsons\n  At the United Nations, there was broad agreement about the Trump plan for Gaza. The Americans heralded the resolution as a key step forward in securing precious peace. Even the Russians, who had put forward a rival resolution, decided to merely abstain. On paper, it looks convincing. Thirteen votes in favour, none against and the two abstentions of Russia and China. But that isn't the whole story. The challenge is that the people who actually fought the war aren't quite as happy. Israel goes along with most of it but is adamant that there should be no road to Palestinian statehood. That desire was inserted into the resolution to placate some countries who felt that too much power was being put into the hands of Israel and America.  But Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has made it abundantly clear that he will allow no such thing. And the reality is that, were Netanyahu to lose his job at next year's elections, he's incredibly unlikely to be succeeded by anyone with a very different take on the subject. So, while the resolution might say there's a path towards a two-state solution, it's hard to find that path running through Israeli politics. Then there's Hamas, which objects, just as vehemently, to the idea that foreigners will not just be running Gaza, but will also be maintaining its security and taking responsibility for disarming Hamas itself.  Clinging to a shred of optimism There is still more we don't know than we actually do know. Who will make up this stabilisation force, what mandate it will follow, how much influence will be exerted by the UN, who will pay for the rebuilding and how the much-heralded Board of Peace will work - including the role of Tony Blair? When, and how, will Israeli troops leave? What happens if the remaining deceased hostages are not returned? When will humanitarian aid really start flooding into the region? What will actually happen to Hamas? And so, so many more questions beyond that. The list stretches to the horizon. Read more:Inside Jordan warehouse where Gaza aid is backing upRemains of Israeli soldier killed in Gaza returned - 11 years later It is easy to be overwhelmed by it all, but there are those here clinging to a shred of optimism. The resolution has been passed and that means the ongoing engagement of America, which many see as the key to ongoing peace. The number of American military personnel, as well as diplomats and private sector employees, now actively planning for Gaza's future runs into many thousands. The optimistic logic runs that, so long as the US is planning for peace rather than war, then peace - shaky, transactional, pragmatic and unpredictable as it may be - is to be welcomed."

        "Content": "The Louvre Museum has temporarily closed one of its galleries due to structural weaknesses.  It came just weeks after a four-strong gang carried out an audacious heist at the Paris landmark, making off with £77.5m worth of jewels. The Campana gallery, which houses nine rooms of ancient Greek ceramics on the first floor, was closed because its structures, designed in the 1930s, are in a dire state, the world's most-visited museum said. A technical report showed weakness in the beams under the second floor of the Sully wing, making it necessary to close the Campana gallery on Monday and relocate 65 museum staff from the second floor, the Louvre said in a statement. On 19 October, two men parked a movers' lift outside the museum, rode up to the second floor, smashed a window and cracked open display cases with angle grinders. The thieves drove away on motorbikes with historical jewels worth $102 million (£77.5 million).  A stolen crown was dropped during the heist, but the other jewels have not yet been recovered. Four suspects are being investigated. The Campana gallery is adjacent to the Apollo gallery, home to the French crown jewels that were targeted in last month's raid. Before the heist, the museum's top administrator had warned about conditions inside the museum, which was visited by 8.7 million people last year. Valerie Baud of the CFDT, a French trade union federation, said staff representatives have been warning about the condition of the building for years because \"it affects working conditions and visitors\". \"But we didn't realise it was this bad,\" she said. \"It is a major deterioration in the situation.\"  A state auditor's report said the management had neglected security and infrastructure in favour of artwork acquisitions and post-pandemic relaunch projects. Originally built in Paris in the late 12th century, the Louvre Palace was for centuries the official residence of the kings of France, until Louis XIV - weary of rebellious crowds in the capital - abandoned it for Versailles, after which it became a museum for the royal art collection in 1793."

Mr Summers, a former president of Harvard University, kept in touch with Epstein after the billionaire financier pleaded guilty in 2008, emails released last week showed.

I take full responsibility for my misguided decision to continue communicating with Mr Epstein,\" he said.   Epstein took his own life in a Manhattan jail in 2019 while awaiting trial on charges he sexually abused and trafficked underage girls. In an email that year, Mr Summers asked Epstein for guidance in relation to a woman with whom he was trying to start a relationship. In the message, Mr Summers wrote: \"I said what are you up to. She said 'I'm busy'.

Cloudflare, which provides network and security services for many online businesses in order to help their websites and applications operate, says around a fifth of all global websites use some of its services.

        "Content": "\n          Middle East correspondent\n              @adamparsons\n  At the United Nations, there was broad agreement about the Trump plan for Gaza. The Americans heralded the resolution as a key step forward in securing precious peace. Even the Russians, who had put forward a rival resolution, decided to merely abstain. On paper, it looks convincing. Thirteen votes in favour, none against and the two abstentions of Russia and China. But that isn't the whole story. The challenge is that the people who actually fought the war aren't quite as happy. Israel goes along with most of it but is adamant that there should be no road to Palestinian statehood. That desire was inserted into the resolution to placate some countries who felt that too much power was being put into the hands of Israel and America.  But Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has made it abundantly clear that he will allow no such thing. And the reality is that, were Netanyahu to lose his job at next year's elections, he's incredibly unlikely to be succeeded by anyone with a very different take on the subject. So, while the resolution might say there's a path towards a two-state solution, it's hard to find that path running through Israeli politics. Then there's Hamas, which objects, just as vehemently, to the idea that foreigners will not just be running Gaza, but will also be maintaining its security and taking responsibility for disarming Hamas itself.  Clinging to a shred of optimism There is still more we don't know than we actually do know. Who will make up this stabilisation force, what mandate it will follow, how much influence will be exerted by the UN, who will pay for the rebuilding and how the much-heralded Board of Peace will work - including the role of Tony Blair? When, and how, will Israeli troops leave? What happens if the remaining deceased hostages are not returned? When will humanitarian aid really start flooding into the region? What will actually happen to Hamas? And so, so many more questions beyond that. The list stretches to the horizon. Read more:Inside Jordan warehouse where Gaza aid is backing upRemains of Israeli soldier killed in Gaza returned - 11 years later It is easy to be overwhelmed by it all, but there are those here clinging to a shred of optimism. The resolution has been passed and that means the ongoing engagement of America, which many see as the key to ongoing peace. The number of American military personnel, as well as diplomats and private sector employees, now actively planning for Gaza's future runs into many thousands. The optimistic logic runs that, so long as the US is planning for peace rather than war, then peace - shaky, transactional, pragmatic and unpredictable as it may be - is to be welcomed."

        "Content": " The wife of murdered Saudi Arabian journalist Jamal Khashoggi says \"zero justice\" has been served over her husband's death. Mr Khashoggi, a strident critic of the kingdom, was slain by Saudi agents in an operation in Istanbul in 2018, and American intelligence agencies concluded Mohammed bin Salman had ordered his capture or killing. The crown prince has denied ordering the operation, but acknowledged responsibility as Riyadh's de-facto ruler. He was hosted at the White House on Tuesday for the first time in seven years, and Donald Trump defended him and cast doubt upon his own country's assessments.  Mr Trump derided Mr Khashoggi as \"extremely controversial\" and said \"a lot of people didn't like that gentleman\". Hanan Khashoggi told Sky News' The World With Yalda Hakim she was \"disappointed\" by the remarks, as she demanded compensation from the crown prince. He has described the killing of her husband as a \"huge mistake\". Addressing Mr Trump directly, Ms Khashoggi said she would be willing to meet the US president to tell him about the Washington Post writer, who she said was \"a great man, and a professional, and he was a brave man as well\". 'They destroyed my life' Ms Khashoggi said her husband was not controversial or unlikeable - but even if he was, \"it doesn't justify the action of kidnapping him, torturing him, killing him and dismantling his body\". She also said she would meet the crown prince and \"ask him to retrieve Jamal's body, so I can bury him in a decent, good way\", as well as ask for financial compensation. \"They killed my husband, they destroyed my life,\" she added. \"They have to compensate me.\" Trump defends MBS Asked about the murder in the Oval Office, Mr Trump said: \"Whether you like him or didn't like him, things happen. \"But he (Bin Salman) knew nothing about it, and we can leave it at that. \"You don't have to embarrass our guest by asking a question like that.\"  Mr Trump even celebrated the Saudi leader for the kingdom's human rights record, without providing specific details. \"I'm very proud of the job he's done,\" he said. Human rights groups say Saudi authorities continue to harshly repress dissent by arresting human rights defenders, journalists and political dissidents. They also highlight a surge in executions in Saudi Arabia they connect to an effort to suppress internal dissent. The crown prince announced Saudi Arabia was increasing its planned investments in the US to $1trn, up from the $600bn the Saudis announced they would pour into the US when Mr Trump visited the kingdom in May."

        "Content": "The US Justice Department engaged in a \"disturbing pattern of profound investigative missteps\" in the process of securing an indictment against former FBI director James Comey, a judge has said. Magistrate Judge William Fitzpatrick said these \"missteps\" include \"fundamental misstatements of the law\" by a prosecutor to the grand jury that indicted Comey in September, the use of potentially privileged communications during an investigation and unexplained irregularities in the transcript of the grand jury proceedings. He said these issues \"led an FBI agent and a prosecutor to potentially undermine the integrity of the grand jury proceeding\". Mr Fitzpatrick directed prosecutors to provide Comey's lawyers with all grand jury materials from the case after reviewing the transcript himself and coming away deeply concerned about the integrity of the case. \"The procedural and substantive irregularities that occurred before the grand jury, and the manner in which evidence presented to the grand jury was collected and used, may rise to the level of government misconduct resulting in prejudice to Mr Comey,\" the judge said in his order on Monday. In response, the Justice Department asked for the ruling to be put on hold to give prosecutors time to file objections. It also said it believed the judge \"may have misinterpreted\" some facts in issuing his ruling. \n                  Epstein files: Bill to release documents gets all-clear from Congress\n                 \n                  Wife of murdered Saudi journalist says 'zero justice' has been served after Trump dismisses US intelligence findings\n                 \n                  'Deeply ashamed' former US treasury secretary Larry Summers quits public life over links to Jeffrey Epstein\n                 The judge in Comey's trial, which is scheduled to begin on 5 January, froze the ruling pending the resolution of the government's objections. Comey is alleged to have made a false statement to the Senate Judiciary Committee in September 2020 by denying he had authorised the disclosure of information to the media, and that he obstructed a congressional proceeding. He denies the charges. The charges were brought by Lindsey Halligan, Mr Trump's former personal attorney, who was installed as the US attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia in September. Proceedings against Comey began after the US president publicly urged Attorney General Pam Bondi to take action against him and other perceived adversaries. He wrote on Truth Social: \"We can't delay any longer, it's killing our reputation and credibility...

Mr Trump and his supporters labelled the investigation a \"hoax\" and a \"witch hunt\" used to undermine his first administration - despite several government reviews showing that Moscow interfered on behalf of the Republican's campaign."

A small tear has certainly appeared in US tech stocks over the past week, with the tech-heavy Nasdaq closing below a key technical indicator for the first time since late April on Monday.

They are likely to be crucial in determining the path for shares ahead. The world's largest company by market value is the beating heart of Wall Street's artificial intelligence boom and any sign of slowdowns, for both revenues and profits, will be catalysts for further sell-offs. Fears have been growing for months that record values are overdone. Stocks linked to AI suffered particularly on Monday, building on declines seen last week, and futures indicated more pain to come when trading begins in the US, though drops were expected to be limited.  Financial analysts said baskets of top AI-linked stocks had now entered so-called correction territory, falling more than 10% in short order this month. Others pointed to an impact on confidence in the crypto market. Bitcoin, which hit a $125,000 spot rate level only last month, stood at $91,000 on Tuesday. It had begun the year around the $94,000 level. Victoria Scholar, head of investment for Interactive Investor, said: \"This year was meant to be the year of the bitcoin bulls supported by a highly crypto-friendly administration in the White House and Trump's 'less is more' approach towards regulation. \"However, fears of an AI bubble and concerns about the market's heavy dependence on a handful of tech giants have caused investors to dial back their exposure to speculative assets such as bitcoin. \"There's a general sense of nervousness that has captured the market mood lately and bitcoin appears to be in the firing line.\" Wider sentiment has also been harmed by weaker bets on the prospects for a further interest rate cut by the US central bank next month. Many financial analysts described the stock market shifts as a healthy correction, given all the uncertainties which include the possibility of a US court ruling against Donald Trump's reciprocal tariffs regime ahead. Mike Gallagher, director of research at Continuum Economics, told Sky's US partner CNBC that the market action implies equities could fall about 5% from recent highs - or \"a bit more\". \"There's some things coming over the horizon that make you want to take a bit of risk off the table,\" he told the channel's Squawk Box Europe show. \"So, part of it is just natural pocket taking, part of it is thinking, 'well, is the macro story going to be perfect? No, it's not.\" He concluded: \"To get a major sell-off, you may need major bad news, and that we haven't actually got to that point yet.\" In the hour after Wall Street opened, the tech company-heavy Nasdaq Composite had dropped nearly 1.8%. The S&P 500 US index of companies relied on to be stable and profitable, lost more than 1% and the index of 30 major companies listed on US stock exchanges, the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA), dropped 1.3%."

Joseph Emerson, a former Alaska Airlines pilot, was sentenced to time served and three years' supervised release by Judge Amy Baggio in the US District Court in Portland, Oregon. Emerson tried to cut the engines of a Horizon Air flight from Everett, Washington, to San Francisco in October 2023. Flight crew subdued him, and the plane was diverted to Portland with more than 80 people on board. The off-duty pilot told police he was upset over a friend's death and had taken psychedelic mushrooms two days before. He said he hadn't slept in more than 40 hours. \"Pilots are not perfect. They are human,\" the judge said. \"They are people and all people need help sometimes.\" Emerson was riding off-duty in an extra seat in the cockpit at the time.

I am here as a direct result of my actions,\" Emerson told the court. \"I can tell you that this very tragic event has forced me to grow as an individual.\" Geoffrey Barrow, assistant US attorney in the district of Oregon, said 84 people could have lost their lives due to Emerson's serious actions and that the crew \"saved the day by intervening\".

        "Content": "\n          Reporter\n              @ClaireGilbodyD\n The best and worst delivery companies have been revealed in new research by Citizens Advice. According to a survey carried out for the report, a record 15 million people experienced a problem with their latest delivery - more than one in three of those surveyed. Yodel came last in a league table compiled by the charity, with a score of two out of five stars. Royal Mail scored the highest at 3.25 out of five stars. Amazon Logistics came second with three stars, followed by DPD and Evri, which both got 2.25. Citizens Advice's league table measured the companies' performance based on customer service, delivery issues and how well they met accessibility needs. The most common issues people faced with their last delivery included the driver leaving before they had time to get to the door (29%), their parcel being left in an insecure location (24%), and parcels arriving late (24%). The charity pointed to regulator Ofcom introducing guidance on complaints and accessibility in 2023, but said its research showed many parcel firms were still \"ignoring the rules\". 'Tougher action needed' Dame Clare Moriarty, chief executive of Citizens Advice, said: \"We continue to see millions of people chasing lost parcels, having their accessibility needs ignored and hitting a brick wall when they try to complain. \"The question now is whether the regulator will take tougher action to improve the parcel market once and for all.\" In response, Ofcom said in a statement to Sky News: \"We have a strong track record of holding parcel firms to account on behalf of the public. \"That has involved tracking people's experiences of parcel deliveries for over a decade, and, as a result, introducing strengthened regulations on parcel firms in 2023. \"Under these rules, postal operators must have a simple and transparent complaints process in place, and have clear and effective policies and procedures for the fair treatment of disabled customers. \"While overall satisfaction is reasonably high at 78%, people's experiences can vary depending on which parcel company delivers their package, and we're continuing to press operators to make further improvements. \"We'll also continue to work with Citizens Advice - as the statutory consumer advocate for post - to achieve our shared goal of ensuring consumers receive a reliable service, whichever company is used.\"  Accessibility found to be the worst performing area Mike, in his 70s, has muscular dystrophy and relies on two walking sticks. He has asked delivery firms not to leave parcels at his front door as he struggles to get there in time. He instead asks them to deliver to his back door, which is closer to his home office and easier for him to reach. But Citizens Advice says companies ignore his requests. It results in parcels often being misdelivered or left exposed to the weather. Read more from Sky News:Number of Britons leaving the UK higher than previously thoughtWhy is flu season set to be worse this year? \"It makes you awfully frustrated, and it makes you really fed up, to the point that I'm beginning to stop buying from retailers that use certain delivery companies,\" Mike said. \"I had one delivery agent chuck a parcel over the back gate on to the concrete floor, who said he'd handed it to the resident. I had the video showing him throwing it over the back gate then taking a picture saying he'd delivered it.\" What have the delivery companies said in response?  Amazon: \"Every day at Amazon, incredible employees and independent delivery partners come together to provide fast, reliable and safe delivery for our customers. \"The vast majority of deliveries make it to customers without issue. In the rare case something occurs, we work with customers directly to make it right.\" Royal Mail: \"We are pleased Royal Mail came first in the Citizens Advice parcels league table for the fourth year running. \"Since last year, we've made great strides in providing customers with the most convenient options for sending, returning and collecting parcels. \"Aside from delivering to every home in the UK, we offer the UK's largest out-of-home network including shops, lockers and parcel post boxes, all introduced to ensure we're the nearest and simplest choice for our customers.\" Evri: \"Every parcel matters, and it is great to receive independent recognition from Citizens Advice of the progress we are already making on service. \"This comes at a time when we have grown significantly in scale to deliver over 900 million parcels a year and follows sustained investments of £57m in operations and technology supporting service improvements over the past 12 months. \"That said, we have further improvements planned and know we have more to do. \"By listening to feedback and investing in the right tools, systems, and training, we have been able to make tangible improvements for our customers as we remain focused on building further trust and consistency across each delivery. \"We are also the only UK parcel carrier to commit to accessibility improvements and since we partnered with disability equality charity Scope in October 2024 improvements include enhanced doorstep and website delivery options, with 90,000 customers already setting accessibility preferences on their Evri account.\" Yodel and DPD did not respond to requests for comment from Sky News. Citizens Advice said between August and September, Opinium Research conducted an online survey of 8,000 adults who received a parcel in the last month from Royal Mail, DPD, Yodel, Amazon Logistics or Evri. The data was weighted to be nationally representative of those that had received a parcel from one of those five companies in the last month."

No, it's not.\" He concluded: \"To get a major sell-off, you may need major bad news, and that we haven't actually got to that point yet.\" In the hour after Wall Street opened, the tech company-heavy Nasdaq Composite had dropped nearly 1.8%. The S&P 500 US index of companies relied on to be stable and profitable, lost more than 1% and the index of 30 major companies listed on US stock exchanges, the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA), dropped 1.3%."

        "Content": " A crackdown on online pricing has seen investigations opened into eight companies, with a further 100 facing warnings over their conduct. The competition watchdog said it was formally examining practices at StubHub, viagogo, AA Driving School, BSM Driving School, Gold's Gym, Wayfair, Appliances Direct and Marks Electrical. The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) said the 100 other companies, which it did not identify, were getting letters outlining concerns about additional fees and sales tactics. Money latest: Nationwide 'lost my £70k' The action against StubHub and viagogo - part of the same company after a 2021 merger - was revealed as the government reportedly prepares to separately confirm a ban on the resale of tickets for live events above their face value. It is part of a long-threatened crackdown on touts to shield consumers from rip-off prices. The regulator's separate action falls under the new Digital Markets, Competition and Consumers Act which gives it additional powers to protect consumers - and further investigations are anticipated. \n                  Best and worst parcel delivery companies revealed\n                 \n                  AI bubble fears take hold of stock markets and bitcoin\n                 \n                  Backlash over £195 'Tom Kerridge beef wellington' from M&S | Money blog\n                 The CMA said StubHub and viagogo were under review \"regarding the mandatory additional charges applied when consumers buy tickets - and whether or not these fees are included upfront\". The AA Driving School and BSM Driving School were being investigated over their \"presentation of mandatory fees on these sites\", the CMA said, \"specifically, whether these fees are included in the total price the consumer sees at the beginning of the purchase process.\" Gold's Gym is under investigation over its presentation of a one-off joining fee for its annual membership, and whether the way it presents this fee breaks the law. It explained that the examination of homeware retailers Wayfair, Appliances Direct, and Marks Electrical was related to whether their time-limited sales \"ended when they said they would, or whether customers are being automatically opted in to purchasing additional services\". Commenting on the CMA's action an AA Driving School spokesperson said: \"We are comfortable that the £3 booking fee for lessons is already transparent and in line with the CMA's rules and are more than happy to additionally notify customers earlier in the journey as well, which we have already done.\" The other companies were yet to comment. The CMA's first major act under the new digital market rules was to give itself special oversight over Apple and Google.  The CMA's so-called \"strategic market status\" rulings mean both companies will face specific obligations to limit their dominance in smartphone and tablet operating systems (iOS and Android respectively), app distribution and browsers. Commenting on its latest inquiry, CMA chief executive Sarah Cardell said: \"At a time when household budgets are under constant pressure and we're all hunting for the best deal possible, it's crucial that people are able to shop online with confidence, knowing that the price they see is the price they'll pay, and any sales are genuine. \"Whether you're spending your hard-earned cash on concert tickets or driving lessons, joining a gym or buying furniture and appliances for your home, you deserve a fair deal. \"It's our job to protect consumers from misleading prices and illegal pressure selling and today marks an important milestone as we take action across the economy to make sure businesses do the right thing by their customers.\" \"Since the launch of the new regime, we've been working hard to help businesses understand the law. But alongside supporting businesses to comply, we've always been clear that we will take swift action where we suspect potentially serious breaches of the law. \"This is just the start of our work. Any businesses who break consumer law should be in no doubt we will stamp out illegal conduct and protect the interests of consumers and fair-dealing businesses.\""

Facebook, AWS (Amazon Web Services), bet365, Canva, BrightHR, and the multiplayer game League of Legends also suffered outages, according to Downdetector.com. More than 10,000 people reported issues linked to Cloudflare, a web infrastructure company, on Tuesday morning.   The issues were first reported around 11am, with several websites, including X, coming back online temporarily before suffering further problems attributed to an \"internal server error on Cloudflare's network\". Cloudflare, which provides network and security services for many online businesses in order to help their websites and applications operate, says around a fifth of all global websites use some of its services. The company said in a server update that it was \"experiencing an internal service degradation\" and that some services may be intermittently affected. It added: \"We are seeing services recover, but customers may continue to observe higher-than-normal error rates as we continue remediation efforts.\" At 1.09pm, Cloudflare said it had identified the issue and was implementing a fix. The outage coincides with Cloudflare's scheduled maintenance at its SCL (Santiago) data centre on Tuesday. Graeme Stewart, head of the public sector at Check Point, a cybersecurity firm credited with creating the first firewall, said: \"Cloudflare going down today sits in the same pattern we saw with the recent AWS and Azure outages. These platforms are vast, efficient and used by almost every part of modern life.\" \"When a platform of this size slips, the impact spreads far and fast and everyone feels it at once,\" he explained. Read more from Sky News:Paris's Louvre closes gallery weeks after heistHacker ordered to pay back over £4m in Bitcoin Mr Stewart said the reported outages did not happen because each organisation failed on its own, but because \"a single layer they all rely on stopped responding\". \"Many organisations still run everything through one route with no meaningful backup. When that route fails, there is no fallback. That is the weakness we keep seeing play out,\" he said. \"The internet was meant to be resilient through distribution, yet we have ended up concentrating huge amounts of global traffic into a handful of cloud providers.\""

The Fife Ethylene Plant (FEP) at Mossmorran - which produces the base material for plastics - is expected to shut in February next year, subject to a full employee consultation. A total of 179 directly employed jobs will be at risk, along with 250 contractors, with the possibility of 50 staff transferring to the Fawley Petrochemical Complex almost 500 miles away in Hampshire. In a statement, the firm said: \"We considered various options to continue production and tested the market for a potential buyer, but the UK's current economic and policy environment combined with market conditions, high supply costs and plant efficiency do not create a competitive future for the site. \"FEP has been a cornerstone of chemical production in the UK for 40 years, and its closure reflects the challenges of operating in a policy environment that is accelerating the exit of vital industries, domestic manufacturing, and the high-value jobs they provide.\" The company acknowledged the impact this will have on its workforce, contractors and local communities.

A spokesperson added: \"This is, of course, a commercial decision for the company to take. \"The UK government explored every reasonable avenue to support the site, but Exxon has had significant global challenges, and this move comes on the heels of closing another chemical plant in France. \"Our focus now must be on supporting the workforce in the months ahead.\" A senior UK government source said there had been \"extensive\" engagement between with the company ahead of the announcement. Forbes 'extremely disappointed' Scotland's Deputy First Minister Kate Forbes said she was \"extremely disappointed by the sudden news\" and described it as a \"significant blow\" to the nation's economy. The MSP added: \"I have met with the business on a number of occasions and expressed my deep concern about the impact this announcement will have on the dedicated workforce, as well as the contractors and supply chain companies whose employment relies on the site.\" The Scottish government will set up a taskforce to look at what it can do to support workers, but Ms Forbes said the majority of powers sit with the UK government on such an issue. She said: \"UK ministers must consider what more they can do for the workers at the plant, and take urgent action to address the high cost of energy which is slowly crippling industry, to help support the sector and the livelihoods of those who depend on it.\" Read more from Sky News:More than 100 firms face online pricing crackdownAI bubble fears take hold of stock markets and bitcoin Calls for a 'planned' transition Robert Deavy, a senior organiser for trade union GMB, which represents contractors on the site, called for politicians to put together a \"planned and measured\" transition.

How many dominoes have to fall?\" Earlier this year, the oil refinery at Grangemouth closed its doors after more than a century in operation, with operator Petroineos blaming soaring costs. More than 400 jobs were lost at the site, leaving both the Scottish and UK governments scrambling to first protect the workforce and subsequently to secure other work. Mr Deavy added: \"Our members do not need more politicians wringing their hands or making more speeches promising just transitions. There is nothing just about what is going on and there is no transition. \"We need politicians willing to finally stand up and demand an industrial strategy that protects the UK's crucial oil and gas while actually delivering a planned and measured transition instead of the economic carnage unfolding day by day.\""

        "Content": " The government is set to ban the resale of tickets for live events above their face value, Sky News understands. Music and sport fans have long complained about live event tickets being quickly bought up only to be immediately relisted at grossly inflated prices. The process is often carried out using bots - automated apps that repeatedly mimic customers to sweep up large numbers of tickets as soon as they're released. The people operating them can be based anywhere in the world. A government consultation had sought views on a proposed cap of 30% above cost, but ministers are expected to set the resale limit at face value, Sky News understands. Service fees charged will also be capped. The government refused to comment when approached by Sky News, but it's believed an announcement could come on Wednesday. Labour pledged in their manifesto to put an end to rip-off tickets and repeated the promise when they came to power. But there has been little word on the policy since, with seven months having gone by since a consultation ended. Dua Lipa, Coldplay, Sam Fender, Iron Maiden, and Radiohead were among acts who last week urged the government to follow through and \"restore faith in the ticketing system\". The Football Supporters' Association, some ticketing firms, and groups representing the theatre and music industries also signed the statement. Ticketmaster parent company, Live Nation Entertainment, said it \"fully supports\" banning resale above face value and added that it already had such a policy. Some UK secondary ticketing sites already have a face value cap or limit the mark-up. Others allow prices far in excess of face value. For example, Viagogo and Stubhub are listing tickets for Radiohead's Saturday show in London from around £400 for seating and from over £700 for standing. The official price was £85 for standing and between £75 to £195 for seating (plus fees). Those prices are almost pocket change compared with some of the amounts quoted earlier this year for the Oasis reunion shows - consumer group Which? found tickets as high as £4,442. Read more from Sky News:Anthony Joshua to take on Jake Paul in boxing matchHow a field became an illegal waste mountain in just months StubHub International warned a price cap would \"condemn fans to take risks to see their favourite live events\". \"With a price cap on regulated marketplaces, ticket transactions will move to black markets,\" said a spokesperson. \"When a regulated market becomes a black market, only bad things happen for consumers. Fraud, fear, and zero recourse.\" Viagogo made similar claims and said regulated price caps had \"repeatedly failed fans\". \"In countries like Ireland and Australia fraud rates are nearly four times higher than in the UK as price caps push consumers towards unregulated sites,\" said a spokesperson."

This is despite former Labour leader Mr Corbyn and ex-Labour MP Ms Sultana co-launching the party in July.

Ms Sultana's event has prompted speculation of a de-facto leadership bid, ahead of a battle for the top job expected in the new year. Members will vote on the leadership model at the conference, beginning officially on 29 November, but the idea proposed in the party's draft constitution is for a single leader rather than a co-leader model. Independent MPs Mr Corbyn and Ms Sultana are yet to say if they will stand for the leadership, though both are widely expected to. The speakers at Ms Sultana's event are figures seen as close to the Coventry South MP and her vision for the party, including Mish Rahman, a former Labour NEC member who is now active in the Democratic Bloc group. Dembloc is a grassroots group of would-be Your Party members who have pushed for activists to have more say in Your Party. They have regularly tweeted in support of Ms Sultana and she spoke at an event they hosted on Monday night.

It follows months of factionalism and infighting at the heart of what promised to be a major moment for the British left but has so far been dominated by rows over leadership, finances and even its name. This has broadly involved two factions - those close to Mr Corbyn who have worked with the former Labour leader for many years, and those close to Ms Sultana who see her as a fresh face for the British left. Your Party says it has 50,000 paid members - but only a fraction will be able to attend the conference after being chosen through a sortition."

We know what you are doing, and in ministers' words today we \"won't stand for it\". But in the wake of the collapsed China spying case last month, the security services also want to reestablish a badly dented sense of deterrence. Politics latest: China responds to MI5's spy warning to MPs  That case against two British men accused of spying for Beijing fell apart because officials would not use the words \"enemy\" or \"national security threat\" to describe China. The failure projected a sense of weakness in the face of Chinese espionage efforts, something the government is keen to dispel. Those efforts remain persistent and dangerous, security officials insist. China has always aggressively sought the official and commercial secrets of Western nations. It regards that mission as a patriotic duty, an essential part of a national project to catch up with and then overtake the West. In the words of Britain's security minister, Dan Jarvis, on Tuesday, China seeks \"to interfere in our sovereign affairs in favour of its own interests\". Read more:Parliamentarians warned of spying attempts from China agents Indeed, much of China's technological and economic progress was, until recently, built on intellectual property stolen from rival nations.

Officially, the Chinese government denies all these allegations. It has to be said that Western spies are also hard at work snooping on China. But critics say Western nations have been naive and too trusting of the Chinese threat. While the British government remains unsure whether to identify China as an enemy or simply a commercial rival, an ambivalence remains, which Beijing will continue doing its best to exploit."

This activity involves a covert and calculated attempt by a foreign power to interfere with our sovereign affairs in favour of its own interests, and this government will not tolerate it.\" The minister said that Foreign Secretary Yvette Cooper met with China's foreign minister Wang Yi on 6 November and told him \"any activity that threatens UK national security, particularly in relation to the UK's parliament and democracy, will not be tolerated\". This latest warning comes after the collapse of a prosecution of two people suspected of spying on behalf of China. 👉 Click here to listen to Electoral Dysfunction on your podcast app 👈 The previous spying allegations led to controversy over how the government under Labour responded to the Crown Prosecution Service's requests for evidence. Sir Keir Starmer sought to blame the previous Conservative government for the issues, which centred on whether China could be designated an \"enemy\" under First World War-era legislation. Sir Keir has sought to keep relationships with Beijing somewhat warm, highlighting the value of China as a trading partner. As part of their reaction to the latest spying attempt, Mr Jarvis announced a slew of new security measures. This includes new investment in sovereign encryption technology, the removal of surveillance equipment manufactured in China, and investment in UK resilience against state-based threats. Mr Jarvis said that the government would use all its tools - including sanctions - if necessary against China, mentioning \"proscription-type tool\" to disrupt proxy organisations. He also said a closed-door meeting would take place with university leaders to warn them about potential influence in the sector. But Mr Jarvis confirmed the government will continue to trade with China, and did not say if the nation would be added to the enhanced tier of the Foreign Influence Registration Scheme (FIRS). He said no decision has been made yet on this area."

        "Content": " Extending the freeze on tax thresholds would amount to a breach of the Labour Party manifesto, the Conservatives have argued. Mel Stride, the shadow chancellor, told a press conference in central London that freezing the thresholds at which income tax and higher rates of income tax begin to apply was a \"stealth tax that will hurt working people\". Politics latest: Number of Britons leaving the UK significantly higher than previously thought Ahead of the general election, the Labour Party promised not to increase taxes on \"working people\", including national insurance, income tax and VAT. It has already been accused of breaking the pledge of national insurance by increasing the amount paid by employers - though Labour said its promise only applied to employees. While extending the freeze on tax thresholds - dubbed a stealth tax because it drags people into paying higher rates even if their wages increase - would not be a technical breach of the manifesto, it would lead to people paying more tax. The current freeze in thresholds, brought in by the previous Conservative government after the pandemic, is due to expire in 2028. \n                  'Not now': Badenoch backs triple lock pension for the moment\n                 \n                  Baroness Newlove, the victims campaigner whose husband Garry was murdered by gang of teenagers, has died\n                 \n                  Reform councillor defects to Tories after becoming 'uncomfortable' with party\n                 But Sky News understands that Rachel Reeves, the chancellor, is expected to freeze income tax thresholds for another two years beyond 2028, in a move that is expected to raise about £8bn by 2010. It is one of a number of measures being considered by Ms Reeves as she seeks to fill an estimated £30bn hole in the public finances. Mr Stride, who was speaking alongside Tory leader Kemi Badenoch, pointed to words spoken by Ms Reeves at last year's budget where she said: \"I have come to the conclusion that extending the threshold freeze would hurt working people. \"It would take more money out of their pay slips. I am keeping every single promise on tax that I made in our manifesto, so there will be no extension of the freeze in income tax and national insurance thresholds.\" Mr Stride said the Tories had calculated that the move could cost some families up to £1,300 across the two years of the freeze, and said it would leave families paying £900 more in tax every year going forward. Ms Badenoch also criticised the potential plan to raise the thresholds, arguing it was being used to \"fund more benefits and shut her backbenchers up\". She was referring to the possibility that Labour may scrap the two-child benefit cap, which means parents can only claim benefits for their first two children. She said scrapping the cap could increase spending by £3.5bn and result in \"more taxes to pay for more welfare spending\". \"Nobody voted for this,\" she said. \"If this Labour government scraps the two-child benefit cap, I want people to know that a future Conservative government will bring it back. \"The cap makes sure that people on benefits have to make the same decisions about having children as everybody else - this is fairness.\" Read more:Labour's immigration reforms at a glanceStarmer: I'll lead Labour into next general election Meanwhile, as Ms Badenoch was laying out her plans, Reform UK leader Nigel Farage claimed they had identified £25bn of annual savings based off targeting foreign nationals in the UK. Speaking alongside Zia Yusuf, Reform's head of policy, Mr Farage said he would limit Universal Credit to British citizens only, raise the immigration health surcharge and reform personal independence payments. Labour Party chair Anna Turley said: \"Reform and the Tories can argue all they like about who will return us to austerity faster - the fact is their plans don't add up and would be a disaster for Britain. \"Nigel Farage is happy to trigger a trade war with Europe, hammering shoppers at the checkouts with higher prices and undoing the work the Labour government has done to drive prices down through three landmark international trade deals. \"Kemi Badenoch's plan to bring forward £47bn of cuts would mean money drained out of your local hospital, your child's school, and your local police. Families who are still bearing the brunt of Liz Truss' mortgage-smashing mini-budget can't afford to pay the price for more of the same old Tory mistakes.\""

Politics latest: Reeves to 'put up taxes to spend more on benefits', claims Badenoch Estimates for net migration of British nationals were previously based on the International Passenger Survey, but the ONS said this had a very small sample size and had been \"stretched beyond its original purpose\". The estimates are now produced using data from the Department for Work and Pensions, which incorporates everyone with a National Insurance number and which can be used to determine the likely migration status of UK individuals. It means that rather than the 77,000 British nationals who were thought to have left the UK in the year ending December 2024, 257,000 in fact left. The statistics, published this morning, show there was also an increase in British nationals returning to the UK last year - up by 83,000 to 143,000, from 60,000. \n                  Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood threatens Trump-style visa ban on three countries as part of radical asylum reforms\n                 \n                  Shabana Mahmood is the new hard woman of British politics - and potential successor to Starmer\n                 \n                  Changes needed to fix 'broken system', as illegal migration 'creating division across our country', says home secretary\n                 The UK population is now also thought to be 97,000 lower than previously estimated. The ONS tracks legal migration and some irregular migration. It said migration from outside the EU had been the main driver of international immigration in recent years, largely due to work and study purposes, as well as for humanitarian reasons such as the Ukraine war. The new data also shows that the peak of net migration - the number of arrivals minus the number of departures - was higher than previously thought. The ONS estimates that net migration hit 944,000 in the year ending March 2023, which is higher than the previously estimated peak of 906,000 in the year ending June 2023. This was followed by a sharper fall than initially reported, with net migration in the year ending December 2024 now estimated to be 345,000, lower than the original estimate of 431,000 that was published by the ONS in May of this year. The figures come amid a wide debate about immigration and asylum that saw the home secretary unveil the biggest policy changes to the UK since the Second World War. Shabana Mahmood, the home secretary, told Sky News' political editor Beth Rigby that the number of illegal immigrants in the UK was \"too high\" and that she was \"horrified\" by the 27% increase in irregular arrivals in the year to June.

The time successful asylum seekers must wait to claim permanent residency in the UK will also increase from five years to 20, and there will no longer be a legal obligation to provide financial support to asylum seekers - so those with the right to work but choose not to will receive no support. In addition, a new appeals body will be set up to significantly speed up the time it takes to decide whether to refuse an asylum application.

Music and sport fans have long complained about live event tickets being quickly bought up only to be immediately relisted at grossly inflated prices. The process is often carried out using bots - automated apps that repeatedly mimic customers to sweep up large numbers of tickets as soon as they're released. The people operating them can be based anywhere in the world. A government consultation had sought views on a proposed cap of 30% above cost, but ministers are expected to set the resale limit at face value, Sky News understands. Service fees charged will also be capped. The government refused to comment when approached by Sky News, but it's believed an announcement could come on Wednesday. Labour pledged in their manifesto to put an end to rip-off tickets and repeated the promise when they came to power. But there has been little word on the policy since, with seven months having gone by since a consultation ended. Dua Lipa, Coldplay, Sam Fender, Iron Maiden, and Radiohead were among acts who last week urged the government to follow through and \"restore faith in the ticketing system\". The Football Supporters' Association, some ticketing firms, and groups representing the theatre and music industries also signed the statement.

Facebook, AWS (Amazon Web Services), bet365, Canva, BrightHR, and the multiplayer game League of Legends also suffered outages, according to Downdetector.com. More than 10,000 people reported issues linked to Cloudflare, a web infrastructure company, on Tuesday morning.   The issues were first reported around 11am, with several websites, including X, coming back online temporarily before suffering further problems attributed to an \"internal server error on Cloudflare's network\". Cloudflare, which provides network and security services for many online businesses in order to help their websites and applications operate, says around a fifth of all global websites use some of its services. The company said in a server update that it was \"experiencing an internal service degradation\" and that some services may be intermittently affected. It added: \"We are seeing services recover, but customers may continue to observe higher-than-normal error rates as we continue remediation efforts.\" At 1.09pm, Cloudflare said it had identified the issue and was implementing a fix. The outage coincides with Cloudflare's scheduled maintenance at its SCL (Santiago) data centre on Tuesday. Graeme Stewart, head of the public sector at Check Point, a cybersecurity firm credited with creating the first firewall, said: \"Cloudflare going down today sits in the same pattern we saw with the recent AWS and Azure outages. These platforms are vast, efficient and used by almost every part of modern life.\" \"When a platform of this size slips, the impact spreads far and fast and everyone feels it at once,\" he explained. Read more from Sky News:Paris's Louvre closes gallery weeks after heistHacker ordered to pay back over £4m in Bitcoin Mr Stewart said the reported outages did not happen because each organisation failed on its own, but because \"a single layer they all rely on stopped responding\". \"Many organisations still run everything through one route with no meaningful backup. When that route fails, there is no fallback. That is the weakness we keep seeing play out,\" he said. \"The internet was meant to be resilient through distribution, yet we have ended up concentrating huge amounts of global traffic into a handful of cloud providers.\""

Alice and Ellen were born in 1936 and trained as ballet dancers in their youth. They began their entertainment careers in the 1950s after their family fled from East Germany to West Germany. Professionally known as The Kessler Twins, they were then discovered by the director of the Lido cabaret theatre in Paris in 1955, launching their international career.

        "Content": "\n          Education reporter\n       Actor Anna Maxwell Martin and a group of parents have warned that primary school tests have \"devastating effects\" for children with special educational needs and disabilities (SEND). They have written an open letter to the government asking ministers to consider reforming SATs (standard assessment tests) to accommodate the youngsters' needs. The 22 parent groups say the system is damaging for children with SEND and they want to see a more inclusive approach which incorporates the needs of the individual child. The letter to Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson said the current system \"actively harms\" children with SEND, leaving them often disengaged from school as they move on to secondary school. Maxwell Martin, who has starred in TV comedy Motherland and police drama Line Of Duty, said: \"The government needs to look much harder at how to make things better for children in schools, particularly children with SEND. \"This is a systemic failing within our assessment system, not the fault of any individual teacher or headteacher.\" What has research found? \n                  AI to tackle truancy by setting school attendance targets\n                 \n                  Ofsted launches new school report card system\n                 \n                  Biggest schools shake-up in England in a decade to cut GCSE exam time - and add AI and fake news lessons\n                 Research by the SEND parent group said only 24% of SEND children passed the SATs, and 67% of SEND children did not want to attend school because of them. Half of the parents questioned also said their child's self-esteem was damaged, and they believed SATs would have a lasting negative impact. 'Change the system' The letter to Ms Phillipson said: \"Forcing children into a system that actively harms them is not the answer. Changing the system so that our children want to attend is.\" But some think SATs do not serve any child. Lee Parkinson MBE, a primary school teacher and education consultant from Manchester, said SATs are a negative process for all children, not just children with SEND. He told Sky News: \"SATs don't serve any child, let alone those with SEND. They were never designed to support learning.\" He called the tests a \"blunt accountability tool, a stick to beat schools with, rather than something that helps teachers understand children\". 'Speed rewarded over understanding' Mr Parkinson claimed SATs were \"built to catch pupils out. They reward speed over understanding and memorisation over genuine thinking\". \"That alone disadvantages huge numbers of children, but for pupils with SEND the gap becomes a chasm. Processing speed, anxiety, sensory needs, working memory difficulties, language disorders… none of these are accounted for in a system that measures every child by the same stopwatch and mark scheme.\" Mr Parkinson added: \"For many SEND pupils, success in school looks like communication gains, emotional regulation, confidence, independence and steady academic growth in a way that matches their needs. \"SATs don't measure any of that. Instead, they label, limit and distort the reality of what progress actually looks like for the children who need thoughtful, personalised provision the most.\" The open letter also said children with SEND who failed SATs \"spend their entire year 6 convinced they are not clever enough\". Read more:How children with SEND from poorer families left behindMPs want overhaul of school support for special needs pupils 'Urgent need for rethink' Sarah Hannafin, head of policy at school leaders' union NAHT, said there is an \"urgent need\" for the government to rethink the value of SATs. \"If statutory tests are here to stay, they must be designed to be accessible for the vast majority of pupils, they should recognise the attainment and progress of all children, and they should not damage children's confidence or cause distress,\" she said. What does the government say? A Department for Education spokesperson said: \"Primary tests and assessments play a vital role in helping schools ensure every pupil can achieve and thrive, while also identifying those who need additional support.\" \"The government's independent, expert-led Curriculum and Assessment Review panel shaped key recommendations aimed at improving our national curriculum, and included key insights from SEND experts. \"We are actively working with parents and experts to improve support for children with SEND, including through more early intervention to prevent needs from escalating and investing £740 million to encourage councils to create more specialist places in mainstream schools.\""

        "Content": " The government is set to ban the resale of tickets for live events above their face value, Sky News understands. Music and sport fans have long complained about live event tickets being quickly bought up only to be immediately relisted at grossly inflated prices. The process is often carried out using bots - automated apps that repeatedly mimic customers to sweep up large numbers of tickets as soon as they're released. The people operating them can be based anywhere in the world. A government consultation had sought views on a proposed cap of 30% above cost, but ministers are expected to set the resale limit at face value, Sky News understands. Service fees charged will also be capped. The government refused to comment when approached by Sky News, but it's believed an announcement could come on Wednesday. Labour pledged in their manifesto to put an end to rip-off tickets and repeated the promise when they came to power. But there has been little word on the policy since, with seven months having gone by since a consultation ended. Dua Lipa, Coldplay, Sam Fender, Iron Maiden, and Radiohead were among acts who last week urged the government to follow through and \"restore faith in the ticketing system\". The Football Supporters' Association, some ticketing firms, and groups representing the theatre and music industries also signed the statement. Ticketmaster parent company, Live Nation Entertainment, said it \"fully supports\" banning resale above face value and added that it already had such a policy.

        "Content": " Do you feel like you know Alan Carr and what he would say or do? What about Taylor Swift, or even Donald Trump? The new Cambridge Dictionary word of the year for 2025 has been revealed: \"parasocial\" - defined as involving or relating to a connection that someone feels between themselves and a famous person they do not know. Psychologists have studied how the rise of one-sided parasocial relationships has redefined fame, fandom and celebrity. For example, when pop star Taylor Swift and American footballer Travis Kelce announced their engagement, many fans felt a strong connection to them despite most not having met them. The parasocial relationships between people and online influencers and AI chatbots is a growing phenomenon. Many people even value parasocial relationships more than some real ones. A 2024 study revealed that while people found their emotional needs were still best met by friends and family, parasocial relationships with YouTubers were valued more than relationships with \"real\" acquaintances or colleagues. Colin McIntosh of the Cambridge Dictionary said: \"What was once a specialist academic term has become mainstream. \n                  Meta rolls out PG-13 restrictions on Instagram teen accounts\n                 \n                  Denmark proposes social media ban for under-15s - as PM hits out at 'monster'\n                 \n                  Trump and Xi discuss TikTok deal to stop US ban\n                 \"Millions of people are engaged in parasocial relationships; many more are simply intrigued by their rise.\" He added that the Cambridge Dictionary website had seen a spike in the number of people searching for the word parasocial. Read more: What are parasocial relationships? The rise of parasocial relationships The term parasocial dates to 1956, when two University of Chicago sociologists observed that television viewers engaged in parasocial relationships with on-screen personalities, resembling those they formed with 'real' family and friends. They observed how the flourishing television industry brought the faces and on-screen personalities of actors into viewer's homes. Simone Schnall, professor of experimental social psychology at the University of Cambridge, said: \"We've entered an age where many people form unhealthy and intense parasocial relationships with influencers. \"This leads to a sense that people 'know' those they form parasocial bonds with, can trust them and even to extreme forms of loyalty. \"Yet it's completely one-sided.\" She went on to say that as trust in mainstream media breaks down, people turn to individual personalities as authorities. After spending so many hours consuming content from these personality authorities, consumers end up developing parasocial bonds, seeing them more as friends, family or even cult leaders. She added that AI tools like ChatGPT, which many people treat as a friend, is adding a new dimension to parasocial relationships. She warned that: \"This is an illusion of a relationship and group think, and we know young people can be susceptible for this.\" Parasocial relationships also carry other risks. Following someone else's experiences day in, day out, inevitably leads to social comparison - and can risk people developing unhealthy ideals or expectations. Other new words this year Other new words in this year's Cambridge Dictionary include \"delulu\", a play on the word delusional, gibberish word \"skibidi\" and \"tradwife\", short for traditional wife. Other words noted as having an impact this year include \"slop\"; content on the internet that is of very low quality, especially that created by AI. Another is \"memeify\", meaning to turn an event, image or person into a meme - an idea, joke, image or video that is quickly shared on the internet."

Today's is... My husband was born on 28 June 1959 and began working in September 1975. We were married on 1 September 1979, and I was born on 28 February 1959. As our family grew, we decided that I would stay at home to raise our three children, as my husband was the primary earner. Sadly, my husband was made redundant in June 2020 and passed away on 15 February 2023, before reaching his state pension age. Throughout his working life, he paid national insurance contributions for approximately 45 years. I began receiving my state pension in February this year, but I was surprised to find that I am not receiving the full amount. I have been advised that I am not entitled to inherit any portion of my late husband's pension or contributions, which I find difficult to understand. Could you advise whether any part of my husband's NI contributions - particularly any protected payments or entitlements - could be applied to increase my pension? Yvonne Smith Money live reporter Jess Sharp tackles this one... Thanks for your email, Yvonne, and I am very sorry for your loss. Dealing with pensions can be an overwhelming task, especially when you're not in a \"typical\" circumstance. When the new state pension was introduced, the system was overhauled with the aim of getting people to build up their own pension benefit, based on the national insurance contributions they had made. Get latest tips and deals in the Money blog Anyone reaching state pension age on or after 6 April 2016 receives this version of the state pension. Due to the changes, there's now little wiggle room for people to inherit state pension contributions. But I spoke to Charlene Young, senior pensions and saving expert at AJ Bell, who pointed out that because you were married before 6 April 2016, you can inherit up to 50% of any protected payment your husband was set to receive. What is a protected payment? There are rules to make sure people who built up most of their NI record before the changes get no less under the new regime than they would have under the old rules, Young explained. \"Put simply, the DWP will take the highest pension amount under the old versus the new system. Any extra amount someone is entitled above the new full, flat rate of £230.25 is called a protected amount,\" she said.

Young gave this example: If your husband would have received a state pension of £12 above the standard, full flat rates, you could inherit 50% of this, equivalent to £6 a week, on top of your own state pension. If your husband was ever \"contracted out\" in his working life, then it's unlikely he would have built up a protected payment, and this would mean there is nothing to inherit from his state pension record. But he might have had additional pension benefits (outside the state pension) thanks to contracting out. You should have been able to inherit any unused pension pot, or receive a spouse's pension, depending on the type of workplace scheme he was in. Check your credit record  You stopped working when you started your family, and Young noted that if you were claiming child benefit during that time, you would have still been able to build up your own state pension record. This is thanks to Home Responsibilities Protection (HRP), the forerunner to the national insurance credit system. \"The DWP has made many errors when it comes to underpaying state pensions to women, including errors with HRP. This is because people claiming child benefit before 2000 didn't have to include their NI number when applying for it, meaning records were not always full,\" Young said. She urged you to double-check your NI record for gaps between 1978 and 2010, particularly in those years you stayed at home to raise your children. The quickest way is to do this online. If you have missing HRP, you could be entitled to a cash payment to correct things. \"The second step is then to press the DWP on whether your husband would have expected a protected payment had he reached state pension age, as you would be eligible to inherit 50% of that on top of your state pension,\" she said.
