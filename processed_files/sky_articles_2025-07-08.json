        "Content": " Emmanuel Macron has said the UK and France have a \"shared responsibility\" to tackle the \"burden\" of illegal migration, as he urged co-operation between London and Paris ahead of a crunch summit later this week. Addressing parliament in the Palace of Westminster on Tuesday, the French president said the UK-France summit would bring \"cooperation and tangible results\" regarding the small boats crisis in the Channel. Politics latest: Lord Norman Tebbit dies, aged 94 Mr Macron - who is the first European leader to make a state visit to the UK since Brexit - told the audience that while migrants' \"hope for a better life elsewhere is legitimate\", \"we cannot allow our countries' rules for taking in people to be flouted and criminal networks to cynically exploit the hopes of so many individuals with so little respect for human life\". \"France and the UK have a shared responsibility to address irregular migration with humanity, solidarity and fairness,\" he added. Looking ahead to the UK-France summit on Thursday, he promised the \"best ever cooperation\" between France and the UK \"to fix today what is a burden for our two countries\". Sir Keir Starmer will hope to reach a deal with his French counterpart on a \"one in, one out\" migrant returns deal at the key summit on Thursday. King Charles also addressed the delegations at a state banquet in Windsor Castle on Tuesday evening, saying the summit would \"deepen our alliance and broaden our partnerships still further\". Sitting next to President Macron, the monarch said: \"Our armed forces will cooperate even more closely across the world, including to support Ukraine as we join together in leading a coalition of the willing in defence of liberty and freedom from oppression. In other words, in defence of our shared values.\" In April, British officials confirmed a pilot scheme was being considered to deport migrants who cross the English Channel in exchange for the UK accepting asylum seekers in France with legitimate claims. The two countries have engaged in talks about a one-for-one swap, enabling undocumented asylum seekers who have reached the UK by small boat to be returned to France. 👉Listen to Politics at Sam and Anne's on your podcast app👈        Britain would then receive migrants from France who would have a right to be in the UK, like those who already have family settled here. The small boats crisis is a pressing issue for the prime minister, given that more than 20,000 migrants crossed the English Channel to the UK in the first six months of this year - a rise of almost 50% on the number crossing in 2024. Elsewhere in his speech, the French president addressed Brexit, and said the UK could not \"stay on the sidelines\" despite its departure from the European Union. He said European countries had to break away from economic dependence on the US and China.

        "Content": " The Princess of Wales and celebrities attended the King's star-studded state banquet on Tuesday, where Emmanuel Macron paid tribute to the late Queen Elizabeth II. On the first day of Mr Macron's state visit, King Charles gave a toast in French and said the three-day trip was another chance to \"celebrate a deep and enduring friendship\". \"What's possibly the most remarkable thing is the way in which the speciality of one country is part of the story of the other,\" the monarch said. \"For centuries, our citizens have admired one another. We've made each other laugh, and we've imitated one another.\" After the King's speech, Mr Macron told him France had a \"real affection for your mother\" Queen Elizabeth II, adding he believed the feeling was \"reciprocal\". \"She was your queen,\" he said. \"To us, she was the Queen.\" He capped off his speech - which repeated his calls for closer relations that he made earlier in the Palace of Westminster - by saying: \"In honour of the United Kingdom, of this entente amico that unites our two fraternal peoples in an unwavering alliance. \"Long live the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland! Long live France!\" The Princess of Wales also made her first appearance at a state banquet in almost two years, sitting next to the French president. She last made an appearance at a grand royal dinner in November 2023 in honour of the South Korean president. It comes after she opened up about her \"rollercoaster\" cancer recovery last week. Also in attendance were Sir Mick Jagger, frontman of The Rolling Stones, who was joined by his fiancee Melanie Hamrick, and Sir Elton John, who was accompanied by his husband David Furnish.

        "Content": "There are 161 people still missing in Texas in the aftermath of last weekend's deadly flash floods, the state's governor has said. Speaking at a news conference on Tuesday, governor Gregg Abbot said the number of missing had risen markedly. He said among the missing were five children and one counsellor from Camp Mystic - where at least 27 people were killed in the flash flooding. At least 109 people are confirmed to have died in the floods, which took place on the 4 July weekend, but this figure has been steadily climbing ever since. The bulk of deaths, and the main search for additional bodies, have been concentrated in Kerr County and the city of Kerrville. The area was transformed into a disaster zone when torrential rains struck the region early last Friday, unleashing deadly flooding along the Guadalupe River. The likes of Travis County, Kendall County, Burnett County, Williamson County, and Tom Green County were also hit. Mr Abbot said many of those who were unaccounted for were in the Texas Hill Country area, but had not registered at a camp or hotel, posing further challenges for authorities. Camp Mystic Mr Abbot planned to make another visit to Camp Mystic. The century-old all-girls Christian summer camp was badly hit by the flash floods, with at least 27 campers and counsellors dying. There were scenes of devastation at the camp as the flood water receded. Outside the cabins where the girls had slept, mud-splattered blankets and pillows were scattered. Also in the debris were pink, purple and light blue luggage, decorated with stickers. Political row However, a political row has unfolded parallel to the recovery efforts, with some questioning whether local authorities sent out warnings and alerts early enough. Similarly, Democrats have criticised Donald Trump over cuts his Elon Musk-launched Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) has made to the National Weather Service - but it isn't clear whether these actually made any difference.

The wall of water overwhelmed cabins, tents and trails along the river's edge. Some survivors were found clinging to trees. Some of the campers had to swim out of their cabin windows to get to safety, while others clung to rope to make it to higher ground."

Authorities also believe that evidence is pointing towards the vehicle \"significantly exceeding the speed limit for the highway\" at the time. The accident happened at 12.30am local time on Thursday (11.30pm Wednesday BST) on the A-52 motorway in the region of Cernadilla, Zamora. \"Among other things, the marks left by one of the vehicle's wheels are being examined,\" the statement from the Civil Guard in Zamora added. Authorities said the report is not yet complete and, once finished, would \"be submitted to the Puebla de Sanabria court\". The 28-year-old Portuguese forward died in the accident in northwestern Spain. Jota's brother, Andre Silva, was also killed in the crash. Local media reported that the speed limit for the road is 120kph (74mph). Pictures following the crash showed debris scattered along the side of the road, including what appeared to be parts of the Lamborghini, which had veered off the road and burst into flames. Family and fans were joined by Liverpool stars past and present and members of Jota's national team for the funeral of the brothers in Portugal on Saturday.  Jota's wife Rute Cardoso, whom he had married just 11 days before the accident, and the footballer's parents, were among those at the service at the Igreja Matriz de Gondomar church in the town of Gondomar, near Porto. Flowers in the shape of football shirts were brought by Liverpool, featuring the brothers' shirt numbers. A number 20, to mark Jota's shirt number for Liverpool, was carried by captain Virgil van Dijk. Andy Robertson brought another featuring a number 30 in honour of Silva, who played in Portugal's second division with Penafiel.

        "Content": "\n          Arts and entertainment reporter\n              @BethanyMinelle\n  Former MasterChef host Gregg Wallace has vowed he will \"not go quietly\", amid reports that he has been sacked from MasterChef. It comes after the TV host faced an investigation, commissioned by MasterChef's production company Banijay UK, into alleged inappropriate behaviour while working for the BBC. In November, the 60-year-old stepped back from presenting the cooking show after accusations that he made sexual comments towards staff and celebrity guests on a range of programmes over 17 years. Broadcaster Kirsty Wark, author and actor Emma Kennedy, and presenter Kirstie Allsopp, were among the high-profile figures who made claims of inappropriate behaviour against Wallace. In a statement, released ahead of the publication of the summary of a report into the claims, the 60-year-old said he had been \"cleared of the most serious and sensational accusations\" made against him. However, he said the report, carried out by independent law firm Lewis Silkin, had found him \"primarily guilty of inappropriate language between 2005 and 2018\". Wallace's statement, published on Instagram, came hours before the BBC News reported that 50 more people had made claims to the corporation against the presenter, including allegations he groped one MasterChef worker and pulled his trousers down in front of another. In his statement, Wallace labelled BBC News's claims as \"uncorroborated tittle-tattle\". Wallace wrote: \"I have taken the decision to speak out ahead of the publication of the Silkin's report - a decision I do not take lightly. \"But after 21 years of loyal service to the BBC, I cannot sit in silence while my reputation is further damaged to protect others. \"I have now been cleared by the Silkin's report of the most serious and sensational accusations made against me. \"The most damaging claims (including from public figures which have not been upheld) were found to be baseless after a full and forensic six-month investigation. \"To be clear, the Silkin's report exonerates me of all the serious allegations which made headlines last year and finds me primarily guilty of inappropriate language between 2005 and 2018.\" 'I was hired as the cheeky greengrocer - now that's a problem' Wallace said he recognised that \"some of my humour and language\" was at times \"inappropriate\" and, for that, he apologised \"without reservation\". \"But I was never the caricature now being sold for clicks,\" Wallace, who also referred to his recent diagnosis of autism, added. \"I was hired by the BBC and MasterChef as the cheeky greengrocer. A real person with warmth, character, rough edges, and all. \"For over two decades, that authenticity was part of the brand. Now, in a sanitised world, that same personality is seen as a problem.\" Wallace: Complaints from 'middle-class women of a certain age' Shortly after the allegations first emerged, Wallace recorded a video where he dismissed his accusers as \"middle-class women of a certain age\". His remarks were met with huge criticism - including from Downing Street, where a spokesperson for the prime minister described them as \"completely inappropriate and misogynistic\". Wallace responded by posting a follow-up clip where he apologised and said he \"wasn't in a good space\" when he posted the comments. Wallace was replaced in the 20th season of MasterChef, which aired this spring, by restaurant critic and former I'm A Celebrity contestant Grace Dent. Several Christmas episodes of the show were also pulled from the BBC's 2024 festive schedule. In April, Wallace spoke to the Daily Mail, denying all accusations against him and saying he had contemplated suicide following the allegations. Wallace's lawyers have previously called allegations that he engages in behaviour of a sexually harassing nature \"entirely false\". A spokesperson for the BBC said: \"Banijay UK instructed the law firm Lewis Silkin to run an investigation into allegations against Gregg Wallace. We are not going to comment until the investigation is complete and the findings are published.\" A Banijay spokesperson told Sky News: \"We won't be commenting until our report is published.\" They have signalled the report will be published later this week or next. Banijay previously said Wallace was \"committed to fully co-operating\" with the external review. Read more from Sky News:Problems emerging at 'Alligator Alcatraz'First malaria treatment for babies approvedThree men guilty of arson attack ordered by Wagner Group Alongside MasterChef, Wallace presented Inside The Factory for BBC Two from 2015 to 2023. He also featured on various BBC shows over the years, including Saturday Kitchen, Eat Well For Less, Supermarket Secrets, Celebrity MasterChef and MasterChef: The Professionals, as well as being a Strictly Come Dancing contestant in 2014. More recently, Wallace has been promoting his health and lifestyle website, offering one-to-one coaching from both himself and a team of experts, which includes nutritionists and doctors, and his wife Anna in the role of recipe curator.

        "Content": "\n          Business and economics correspondent\n              @pkelso\n  At least 13 people may have taken their own lives after being accused of wrongdoing based on evidence from the Horizon IT system that the Post Office and developers Fujitsu knew could be false, the public inquiry has found. A further 59 people told the inquiry they considered ending their lives, 10 of whom tried on at least one occasion, while other postmasters and family members recount suffering from alcoholism and mental health disorders including anorexia and depression, family breakup, divorce, bankruptcy and personal abuse. Follow latest on public inquiry into Post Office scandal Writing in the first volume of the Post Office Horizon IT Inquiry report, chairman Sir Wyn Williams concludes that this enormous personal toll came despite senior employees at the Post Office knowing the Horizon IT system could produce accounts \"which were illusory rather than real\" even before it was rolled out to branches. Sir Wyn said: \"I am satisfied from the evidence that I have heard that a number of senior, and not so senior, employees of the Post Office knew or, at the very least, should have known that Legacy Horizon was capable of error… Yet, for all practical purposes, throughout the lifetime of Legacy Horizon, the Post Office maintained the fiction that its data was always accurate.\"  Referring to the updated version of Horizon, known as Horizon Online, which also had \"bugs errors and defects\" that could create illusory accounts, he said: \"I am satisfied that a number of employees of Fujitsu and the Post Office knew that this was so.\" The first volume of the report focuses on what Sir Wyn calls the \"disastrous\" impact of false accusations made against at least 1,000 postmasters, and the various redress schemes the Post Office and government has established since miscarriages of justice were identified and proven. Recommendations regarding the conduct of senior management of the Post Office, Fujitsu and ministers will come in a subsequent report, but Sir Wyn is clear that unjust and flawed prosecutions were knowingly pursued. \"All of these people are properly to be regarded as victims of wholly unacceptable behaviour perpetrated by a number of individuals employed by and/or associated with the Post Office and Fujitsu from time to time and by the Post Office and Fujitsu as institutions,\" he says.  What are the inquiry's recommendations? Calling for urgent action from government and the Post Office to ensure \"full and fair compensation\", he makes 19 recommendations including: • Government and the Post Office to agree a definition of \"full and fair\" compensation to be used when agreeing payouts• Ending \"unnecessarily adversarial attitude\" to initial offers that have depressed the value of payouts, ⁠and ensuring consistency across all four compensation schemes• The creation of a standing body to administer financial redress to people wronged by public bodies• Compensation to be extended to close family members of those affected who have suffered \"serious negative consequences\"• The Post Office, Fujitsu and government agreeing a programme for \"restorative justice\", a process that brings together those that have suffered harm with those that have caused it Regarding the human impact of the Post Office's pursuit of postmasters, including its use of unique powers of prosecution, Sir Wyn writes: \"I do not think it is easy to exaggerate the trauma which persons are likely to suffer when they are the subject of criminal investigation, prosecution, conviction and sentence.\" He says that even the process of being interviewed under caution by Post Office investigators \"will have been troubling at best and harrowing at worst\". 👉 Listen to Sky News Daily on your podcast app 👈 'Hostile and abusive behaviour' The report finds that those wrongfully convicted were \"subject to hostile and abusive behaviour\" in their local communities, felt shame and embarrassment, with some feeling forced to move. Detailing the impact on close family members of those prosecuted, Sir Wyn writes: \"Wives, husbands, children and parents endured very significant suffering in the form of distress, worry and disruption to home life, in employment and education. \"In a number of cases, relationships with spouses broke down and ended in divorce or separation. \"In the most egregious cases, family members themselves suffered psychiatric illnesses or psychological problems and very significant financial losses… their suffering has been acute.\"  The report includes 17 case studies of those affected by the scandal including some who have never spoken publicly before. They include Millie Castleton, daughter of Lee Castleton, one of the first postmasters prosecuted. She told the inquiry how her family being \"branded thieves and liars\" affected her mental health, and contributed to a diagnosis of anorexia that forced her to drop out of university. Her account concludes: \"Even now as I go into my career, I still find it so incredibly hard to trust anyone, even subconsciously. I sabotage myself by not asking for help with anything. \"I'm trying hard to break this cycle but I'm 26 and am very conscious that I may never be able to fully commit to natural trust. But my family is still fighting. I'm still fighting, as are many hundreds involved in the Post Office trial.\" Read more:Analysis: Inquiry's heart-breaking legacySir Alan Bates calls for justice for victims Fujitsu has 'moral obligation' to pay-up Responding to criticism about victims suffering long delays before receiving compensation, Post Office minister, Gareth Thomas, told Sky News that he accepted that payments should have been made sooner and pledged \"to go further and faster\" in future. \"We've been working on the initial scope of a scheme to compensate family members that were very closely associated with those who suffered most as a result of the scandal,\" he said. Mr Thomas added that it was not acceptable that compensation was effectively being paid by taxpayers, while Fujitsu had not made any contributions. \"We have underlined that in face-to-face meetings with them. To be fair, they have accepted that they have that moral obligation. \"We have made clear to them that we think they should make an interim payment ahead of Sir Wynne's final report, which will set out the degree of culpability of all sorts of the players in this terrible scandal, including the role of Fujitsu,\" he said. Inquiry findings 'important milestone' Business Secretary Jonathan Reynolds said the inquiry's report \"marks an important milestone for sub-postmasters and their families\". He added that he was \"committed to ensuring wronged sub-postmasters are given full, fair, and prompt redress\". \"The recommendations contained in Sir Wyn's report require careful reflection, including on further action to complete the redress schemes,\" Mr Reynolds said. \"Government will promptly respond to the recommendations in full in parliament.\" Anyone feeling emotionally distressed or suicidal can call Samaritans for help on 116 123 or email jo@samaritans.org in the UK.

        "Content": " The UK's public finances are in a \"relatively vulnerable position\", the government's official forecaster has warned.\n The Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) cited a drag from successive economic shocks, recent U-turns on spending cuts and higher-than-expected policy commitments. It sounded alarm over the projected path for debt as a result, in its annual fiscal risks and sustainability report. It saw total debt above 270% of gross domestic product (GDP) by the early 2070s - up from a current level of 96.5% - declaring that rising debts have led to \"a substantial erosion of the UK's capacity to respond to future shocks\". Money latest: Amazon launches 24/7 grocery deliveries The OBR's report highlighted damage from the COVID pandemic and cost of living crisis that followed Russia's invasion of Ukraine. But it raised fears that past and current government policies were further harming the sustainability of the public finances. \n                  Building societies step up protest against Reeves's cash ISA reforms\n                 \n                  Reeves's tax turmoil deepens\n                 \n                  Rachel Reeves hints at tax rises in autumn budget after welfare bill U-turn\n                 The report said that the pension triple lock, for example, was now estimated to cost £15.5bn annually by 2029-30. That was \"around three times higher than initial expectations\", it said. The lock, which rises each year in line with inflation, wage growth or 2.5% - whichever is higher - had risen by more than the 2.5% base in eight of the 13 years of operation to date, the report stated. The watchdog said it reflected more volatile inflation than expected. It also picked up on the latest government U-turns over planned welfare and winter fuel payment cuts in the face of rebellions by Labour MPs.  The decisions are expected to leave Chancellor Rachel Reeves facing a black hole of £6.75bn while weaker-than-expected economic growth could add a further £9bn to that sum in the run-up to the autumn budget, according to Sky News projections that see a void of around £20bn. The OBR highlighted future risks from rising defence spending and the impact of climate change. Public sector pay demands could also prove a drag, with resident doctors voting in favour of strikes over pay. While ministers acknowledge damage to the public purse from the U-turns, Ms Reeves has repeatedly ruled out a new wave of borrowing to fund a spending spree.  As such, the government has not ruled out the prospect of some form of wealth tax to help meet its commitments despite the top 1% of earners contributing almost a third of all income tax already - on top of other targeted taxes such as capital gains. The report said: \"Efforts to put the UK's public finances on a more sustainable footing have met with only limited and temporary success in recent years in the aftermath of the shocks, debt has also continued to rise and borrowing remained elevated because governments have reversed plans to consolidate the public finances. \"Planned tax rises have been reversed, and, more significantly, planned spending reductions have been abandoned.\" Shadow chancellor Mel Stride said of the report: \"The OBR's report lays bare the damage: Britain now has the third-highest deficit and the fourth-highest debt burden in Europe, with borrowing costs among the highest in the developed world. \"Under Rachel Reeves' economic mismanagement and Keir Starmer's weak leadership, our public finances have become dangerously exposed - vulnerable to future shocks, welfare spending rising unsustainably, taxes rising to record highs and crippling levels of debt interest. \"Labour's recklessness risks it all - your pension, your job, your home, your savings.\" A Number 10 spokesman said: \"We recognise the realities set out in the OBR's report and we're taking the decisions needed to provide stability to the public finances.\""

        "Content": " Emmanuel Macron has said the UK and France have a \"shared responsibility\" to tackle the \"burden\" of illegal migration, as he urged co-operation between London and Paris ahead of a crunch summit later this week. Addressing parliament in the Palace of Westminster on Tuesday, the French president said the UK-France summit would bring \"cooperation and tangible results\" regarding the small boats crisis in the Channel. Politics latest: Lord Norman Tebbit dies, aged 94 Mr Macron - who is the first European leader to make a state visit to the UK since Brexit - told the audience that while migrants' \"hope for a better life elsewhere is legitimate\", \"we cannot allow our countries' rules for taking in people to be flouted and criminal networks to cynically exploit the hopes of so many individuals with so little respect for human life\". \"France and the UK have a shared responsibility to address irregular migration with humanity, solidarity and fairness,\" he added. Looking ahead to the UK-France summit on Thursday, he promised the \"best ever cooperation\" between France and the UK \"to fix today what is a burden for our two countries\". Sir Keir Starmer will hope to reach a deal with his French counterpart on a \"one in, one out\" migrant returns deal at the key summit on Thursday. King Charles also addressed the delegations at a state banquet in Windsor Castle on Tuesday evening, saying the summit would \"deepen our alliance and broaden our partnerships still further\". Sitting next to President Macron, the monarch said: \"Our armed forces will cooperate even more closely across the world, including to support Ukraine as we join together in leading a coalition of the willing in defence of liberty and freedom from oppression. In other words, in defence of our shared values.\" In April, British officials confirmed a pilot scheme was being considered to deport migrants who cross the English Channel in exchange for the UK accepting asylum seekers in France with legitimate claims. The two countries have engaged in talks about a one-for-one swap, enabling undocumented asylum seekers who have reached the UK by small boat to be returned to France. 👉Listen to Politics at Sam and Anne's on your podcast app👈        Britain would then receive migrants from France who would have a right to be in the UK, like those who already have family settled here. The small boats crisis is a pressing issue for the prime minister, given that more than 20,000 migrants crossed the English Channel to the UK in the first six months of this year - a rise of almost 50% on the number crossing in 2024. Elsewhere in his speech, the French president addressed Brexit, and said the UK could not \"stay on the sidelines\" despite its departure from the European Union.

        "Content": "\n          Arts and entertainment reporter\n              @BethanyMinelle\n  Former MasterChef host Gregg Wallace has vowed he will \"not go quietly\", amid reports that he has been sacked from MasterChef. It comes after the TV host faced an investigation, commissioned by MasterChef's production company Banijay UK, into alleged inappropriate behaviour while working for the BBC. In November, the 60-year-old stepped back from presenting the cooking show after accusations that he made sexual comments towards staff and celebrity guests on a range of programmes over 17 years. Broadcaster Kirsty Wark, author and actor Emma Kennedy, and presenter Kirstie Allsopp, were among the high-profile figures who made claims of inappropriate behaviour against Wallace. In a statement, released ahead of the publication of the summary of a report into the claims, the 60-year-old said he had been \"cleared of the most serious and sensational accusations\" made against him. However, he said the report, carried out by independent law firm Lewis Silkin, had found him \"primarily guilty of inappropriate language between 2005 and 2018\". Wallace's statement, published on Instagram, came hours before the BBC News reported that 50 more people had made claims to the corporation against the presenter, including allegations he groped one MasterChef worker and pulled his trousers down in front of another. In his statement, Wallace labelled BBC News's claims as \"uncorroborated tittle-tattle\". Wallace wrote: \"I have taken the decision to speak out ahead of the publication of the Silkin's report - a decision I do not take lightly. \"But after 21 years of loyal service to the BBC, I cannot sit in silence while my reputation is further damaged to protect others. \"I have now been cleared by the Silkin's report of the most serious and sensational accusations made against me. \"The most damaging claims (including from public figures which have not been upheld) were found to be baseless after a full and forensic six-month investigation. \"To be clear, the Silkin's report exonerates me of all the serious allegations which made headlines last year and finds me primarily guilty of inappropriate language between 2005 and 2018.\" 'I was hired as the cheeky greengrocer - now that's a problem' Wallace said he recognised that \"some of my humour and language\" was at times \"inappropriate\" and, for that, he apologised \"without reservation\". \"But I was never the caricature now being sold for clicks,\" Wallace, who also referred to his recent diagnosis of autism, added. \"I was hired by the BBC and MasterChef as the cheeky greengrocer. A real person with warmth, character, rough edges, and all. \"For over two decades, that authenticity was part of the brand. Now, in a sanitised world, that same personality is seen as a problem.\" Wallace: Complaints from 'middle-class women of a certain age' Shortly after the allegations first emerged, Wallace recorded a video where he dismissed his accusers as \"middle-class women of a certain age\". His remarks were met with huge criticism - including from Downing Street, where a spokesperson for the prime minister described them as \"completely inappropriate and misogynistic\". Wallace responded by posting a follow-up clip where he apologised and said he \"wasn't in a good space\" when he posted the comments. Wallace was replaced in the 20th season of MasterChef, which aired this spring, by restaurant critic and former I'm A Celebrity contestant Grace Dent. Several Christmas episodes of the show were also pulled from the BBC's 2024 festive schedule. In April, Wallace spoke to the Daily Mail, denying all accusations against him and saying he had contemplated suicide following the allegations. Wallace's lawyers have previously called allegations that he engages in behaviour of a sexually harassing nature \"entirely false\". A spokesperson for the BBC said: \"Banijay UK instructed the law firm Lewis Silkin to run an investigation into allegations against Gregg Wallace. We are not going to comment until the investigation is complete and the findings are published.\" A Banijay spokesperson told Sky News: \"We won't be commenting until our report is published.\" They have signalled the report will be published later this week or next. Banijay previously said Wallace was \"committed to fully co-operating\" with the external review.

        "Content": "\n          Business and economics correspondent\n              @pkelso\n  At least 13 people may have taken their own lives after being accused of wrongdoing based on evidence from the Horizon IT system that the Post Office and developers Fujitsu knew could be false, the public inquiry has found. A further 59 people told the inquiry they considered ending their lives, 10 of whom tried on at least one occasion, while other postmasters and family members recount suffering from alcoholism and mental health disorders including anorexia and depression, family breakup, divorce, bankruptcy and personal abuse. Follow latest on public inquiry into Post Office scandal Writing in the first volume of the Post Office Horizon IT Inquiry report, chairman Sir Wyn Williams concludes that this enormous personal toll came despite senior employees at the Post Office knowing the Horizon IT system could produce accounts \"which were illusory rather than real\" even before it was rolled out to branches. Sir Wyn said: \"I am satisfied from the evidence that I have heard that a number of senior, and not so senior, employees of the Post Office knew or, at the very least, should have known that Legacy Horizon was capable of error… Yet, for all practical purposes, throughout the lifetime of Legacy Horizon, the Post Office maintained the fiction that its data was always accurate.\"  Referring to the updated version of Horizon, known as Horizon Online, which also had \"bugs errors and defects\" that could create illusory accounts, he said: \"I am satisfied that a number of employees of Fujitsu and the Post Office knew that this was so.\" The first volume of the report focuses on what Sir Wyn calls the \"disastrous\" impact of false accusations made against at least 1,000 postmasters, and the various redress schemes the Post Office and government has established since miscarriages of justice were identified and proven. Recommendations regarding the conduct of senior management of the Post Office, Fujitsu and ministers will come in a subsequent report, but Sir Wyn is clear that unjust and flawed prosecutions were knowingly pursued. \"All of these people are properly to be regarded as victims of wholly unacceptable behaviour perpetrated by a number of individuals employed by and/or associated with the Post Office and Fujitsu from time to time and by the Post Office and Fujitsu as institutions,\" he says.  What are the inquiry's recommendations? Calling for urgent action from government and the Post Office to ensure \"full and fair compensation\", he makes 19 recommendations including: • Government and the Post Office to agree a definition of \"full and fair\" compensation to be used when agreeing payouts• Ending \"unnecessarily adversarial attitude\" to initial offers that have depressed the value of payouts, ⁠and ensuring consistency across all four compensation schemes• The creation of a standing body to administer financial redress to people wronged by public bodies• Compensation to be extended to close family members of those affected who have suffered \"serious negative consequences\"• The Post Office, Fujitsu and government agreeing a programme for \"restorative justice\", a process that brings together those that have suffered harm with those that have caused it Regarding the human impact of the Post Office's pursuit of postmasters, including its use of unique powers of prosecution, Sir Wyn writes: \"I do not think it is easy to exaggerate the trauma which persons are likely to suffer when they are the subject of criminal investigation, prosecution, conviction and sentence.\" He says that even the process of being interviewed under caution by Post Office investigators \"will have been troubling at best and harrowing at worst\". 👉 Listen to Sky News Daily on your podcast app 👈 'Hostile and abusive behaviour' The report finds that those wrongfully convicted were \"subject to hostile and abusive behaviour\" in their local communities, felt shame and embarrassment, with some feeling forced to move. Detailing the impact on close family members of those prosecuted, Sir Wyn writes: \"Wives, husbands, children and parents endured very significant suffering in the form of distress, worry and disruption to home life, in employment and education. \"In a number of cases, relationships with spouses broke down and ended in divorce or separation. \"In the most egregious cases, family members themselves suffered psychiatric illnesses or psychological problems and very significant financial losses… their suffering has been acute.\"  The report includes 17 case studies of those affected by the scandal including some who have never spoken publicly before. They include Millie Castleton, daughter of Lee Castleton, one of the first postmasters prosecuted. She told the inquiry how her family being \"branded thieves and liars\" affected her mental health, and contributed to a diagnosis of anorexia that forced her to drop out of university. Her account concludes: \"Even now as I go into my career, I still find it so incredibly hard to trust anyone, even subconsciously. I sabotage myself by not asking for help with anything. \"I'm trying hard to break this cycle but I'm 26 and am very conscious that I may never be able to fully commit to natural trust. But my family is still fighting. I'm still fighting, as are many hundreds involved in the Post Office trial.\" Read more:Analysis: Inquiry's heart-breaking legacySir Alan Bates calls for justice for victims Fujitsu has 'moral obligation' to pay-up Responding to criticism about victims suffering long delays before receiving compensation, Post Office minister, Gareth Thomas, told Sky News that he accepted that payments should have been made sooner and pledged \"to go further and faster\" in future. \"We've been working on the initial scope of a scheme to compensate family members that were very closely associated with those who suffered most as a result of the scandal,\" he said. Mr Thomas added that it was not acceptable that compensation was effectively being paid by taxpayers, while Fujitsu had not made any contributions. \"We have underlined that in face-to-face meetings with them. To be fair, they have accepted that they have that moral obligation. \"We have made clear to them that we think they should make an interim payment ahead of Sir Wynne's final report, which will set out the degree of culpability of all sorts of the players in this terrible scandal, including the role of Fujitsu,\" he said. Inquiry findings 'important milestone' Business Secretary Jonathan Reynolds said the inquiry's report \"marks an important milestone for sub-postmasters and their families\". He added that he was \"committed to ensuring wronged sub-postmasters are given full, fair, and prompt redress\". \"The recommendations contained in Sir Wyn's report require careful reflection, including on further action to complete the redress schemes,\" Mr Reynolds said. \"Government will promptly respond to the recommendations in full in parliament.\" Anyone feeling emotionally distressed or suicidal can call Samaritans for help on 116 123 or email jo@samaritans.org in the UK.

That was \"around three times higher than initial expectations\", it said. The lock, which rises each year in line with inflation, wage growth or 2.5% - whichever is higher - had risen by more than the 2.5% base in eight of the 13 years of operation to date, the report stated. The watchdog said it reflected more volatile inflation than expected. It also picked up on the latest government U-turns over planned welfare and winter fuel payment cuts in the face of rebellions by Labour MPs.  The decisions are expected to leave Chancellor Rachel Reeves facing a black hole of £6.75bn while weaker-than-expected economic growth could add a further £9bn to that sum in the run-up to the autumn budget, according to Sky News projections that see a void of around £20bn. The OBR highlighted future risks from rising defence spending and the impact of climate change. Public sector pay demands could also prove a drag, with resident doctors voting in favour of strikes over pay. While ministers acknowledge damage to the public purse from the U-turns, Ms Reeves has repeatedly ruled out a new wave of borrowing to fund a spending spree.  As such, the government has not ruled out the prospect of some form of wealth tax to help meet its commitments despite the top 1% of earners contributing almost a third of all income tax already - on top of other targeted taxes such as capital gains. The report said: \"Efforts to put the UK's public finances on a more sustainable footing have met with only limited and temporary success in recent years in the aftermath of the shocks, debt has also continued to rise and borrowing remained elevated because governments have reversed plans to consolidate the public finances. \"Planned tax rises have been reversed, and, more significantly, planned spending reductions have been abandoned.\" Shadow chancellor Mel Stride said of the report: \"The OBR's report lays bare the damage: Britain now has the third-highest deficit and the fourth-highest debt burden in Europe, with borrowing costs among the highest in the developed world. \"Under Rachel Reeves' economic mismanagement and Keir Starmer's weak leadership, our public finances have become dangerously exposed - vulnerable to future shocks, welfare spending rising unsustainably, taxes rising to record highs and crippling levels of debt interest. \"Labour's recklessness risks it all - your pension, your job, your home, your savings.\" A Number 10 spokesman said: \"We recognise the realities set out in the OBR's report and we're taking the decisions needed to provide stability to the public finances.\""

        "Content": "\n          Political editor\n              @BethRigby\n Emmanuel Macron addressing parliament in the Palace of Westminster's Royal Gallery was a highly anticipated moment in the long history of our two nations. That story - the conflict and a historic Anglo-French agreement that ended centuries of feuding, the Entente Cordiale - adorn the walls of this great hall. Looming over the hundreds of MPs and peers who had gathered in the heat to hear the French president speak, hang two monumental paintings depicting British victories in the Napoleonic wars, while the glass stand in the room commemorates the 408 Lords who lost their lives fighting for Europe in two world wars. Politics latest: UK and France will get 'tangible results' on migration The French president came to parliament as the first European leader to be honoured with a state visit since Brexit. It was the first address of a French president to parliament since 2008, and Mr Macron used it to mark what he called a new era in Anglo-Franco relations.  Peers and MPs cheered with delight when he confirmed France would loan the Bayeux Tapestry to the UK in the run-up to the anniversary of William the Conqueror's birthday. \"I have to say, it took properly more years to deliver that project than all the Brexit texts,\" he joked as former prime minister Theresa May watched on from the front row From Brexit to migration, European security, to a two-state solution and the recognition of Palestine, Mr Macron did not shy away from thorny issues, as he turned the page on Brexit tensions woven through Anglo-French relations in recent years, in what one peer described to me as a \"very political speech rather than just the usual warm words\". He also used this address to praise Sir Keir Starmer, sitting in the audience, for his leadership on security and Ukraine, and his commitment to the international order and alliances forged from the ashes of the Second World War. For that, he received a loud ovation from the gathered parliamentarians.  Read more:Thatcher loyalist Norman Tebitt dies aged 94Public finances in 'relatively vulnerable position' The test now for Sir Keir is whether he can turn his deft diplomatic work in recent months with Mr Macron into concrete action to give him a much-needed win on the domestic front, particularly after his torrid week on welfare. The government hopes that France's aim for \"cooperation and tangible results\" at the upcoming political summit as part of this state visit, will give Starmer a much-needed boost. The PM is attempting to drive-down crossings by negotiating a one-in one-out return treaty with France. Under this plan, those crossing the Channel illegally will be sent back to France in exchange for Britain taking in an asylum seeker with a family connection in the UK. But as I understand it, the deal is still in the balance, with some EU countries unhappy about France and the UK agreeing on a bilateral deal."

The British number three, 29, was attempting to become just the third home player in the open era to defeat a men's title holder after Roger Taylor and Tim Henman but succumbed to a straight sets defeat (6-2, 6-3, 6-3) in just an hour and 39 minutes.

One US source said: \"The US pressure on Israel has begun, and tonight it will be heavy.\" The source, who is not authorised to speak publicly, was referring to the White House dinner on Monday night between Trump and Netanyahu. A second Middle Eastern diplomatic source agreed that the American pressure on Israel would be intense. Netanyahu arrived in Washington DC in the early hours of Monday morning and held meetings on Monday with Steve Witkoff, Trump's Middle East envoy, and Marco Rubio, the secretary of state and national security adviser. The Israeli prime minister plans to be in Washington until Thursday with meetings on Capitol Hill on Tuesday. Trump has made clear his desire to bring the Gaza conflict to an end. However, he has never articulated how a lasting peace, which would satisfy both the Israelis and Palestinians, could be achieved. His varying comments about ownership of Gaza, moving Palestinians out of the territory and permanent resettlement, have presented a confusing policy.  Situation for Palestinians worse than ever Over the coming days, we will see the extent to which Trump demands that Netanyahu accepts the current Gaza ceasefire deal, even if it falls short of Israel's war aims - the elimination of Hamas. The strategic objective to permanently remove Hamas seems always to have been impossible. Hamas as an entity was the extreme consequence of the Israeli occupation. The Palestinians' challenge has not gone away, and the situation for Palestinians now is worse than it has ever been in Gaza and also the West Bank. It is not clear how Trump plans to square that circle.

In this context, the complexities of conflicts - in Ukraine or Gaza - are often of secondary importance to the president. If Netanyahu can be persuaded to end the war, what would he need? The hostages back - for sure. That would require agreement from Hamas. They would only agree to this if they have guarantees on Gaza's future and their own future. More circles to square.

Two powerful men in the Blue Room of the White House, deciding the direction of the region. Will it be seen as the moment the region was remoulded? But to whose benefit? Trump is a dealmaker with an eye on the prize. But Netanyahu is a political master; they don't call him \"the magician\" for nothing. Trump makes decisions instinctively. He can shift position quickly and often listens to the last person in the room. Right now - that person is Netanyahu. Gaza is one part of a jigsaw of challenges, which could become opportunities. Diplomatic normalisation between Israel and the Arab world is a prize for Trump and could genuinely secure him the Nobel Peace Prize. But without the Gaza piece, the jigsaw is incomplete."

Warning: This story contains descriptions of rape and sexual violence The findings, published by the Dinah Project, argue that these acts amount to conflict-related sexual violence (CRSV), and assert that \"Hamas used sexual violence as a tactical weapon of war\". The report draws on 18 months of investigation and is based on survivor testimonies, eyewitness accounts, and interviews with first responders, morgue personnel and healthcare professionals. According to the Dinah Project, the documented patterns - such as forced nudity, gang rapes, genital mutilation, and threats of forced marriage - indicate a deliberate and coordinated use of sexual violence by Hamas operatives during the attack. Reported incidents span at least six locations, including the Nova music festival, and several kibbutzim in southern Israel. One section of the report describes victims \"found fully or partially naked from the waist down, with their hands tied behind their backs and/or to structures such as trees and poles, and shot\". At the Nova music festival and surrounding areas, the investigators found \"reasonable grounds to believe\" that multiple women were raped or gang-raped before being killed. The report's findings are consistent with earlier investigations by the United Nations and the International Criminal Court (ICC). Read more:What is the possible Gaza hostage and ceasefire deal?Israeli soldier describes arbitrary killing of civilians in Gaza The UN's Special Representative on Sexual Violence in Conflict previously concluded that there were \"reasonable grounds to believe\" CRSV took place during the attack. Significantly, the Dinah Project urges the international community to officially recognise the use of sexual violence by Hamas as a deliberate strategy of war and calls on the United Nations to add Hamas to its list of parties responsible for conflict-related sexual violence. The nature and scale of sexual violence on 7 October have been a subject of intense controversy, with some accusing parties of weaponising the narrative for political ends. This report seeks to confront what its authors call \"denial, misinformation, and global silence,\" and to provide justice for the victims. Hamas has denied that its fighters have used sexual violence and mistreated female hostages."

The Florida Division of Emergency Management (FDEM), run by Governor Ron DeSantis, posted on X that detainees were at the site on 3 July just before 1pm local time (6pm UK time). Donald Trump held a tour of the facility on 1 July that took journalists around \"Alligator Alcatraz\". Its name is a reference to both the local reptile population and the former maximum-security Alcatraz Federal Penitentiary in San Francisco Bay, California. The tour showed the rapid construction of the centre, designed to accommodate up to 3,000 detainees. The purpose of the site is to house individuals detained by US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). James Uthmeier, Florida's attorney general, posted on X: \"And in just a week, Alligator Alcatraz was built.\" Political commentator Benny Johnson, who was on the tour, praised the eight-day turnaround. \"I don't think anyone realises how impressive Alligator Alcatraz is,\" he said. \n                  Benjamin Netanyahu nominates Donald Trump for Nobel Peace Prize - as Gaza ceasefire talks continue \n                 \n                  Trump applying 'heavy pressure' on Netanyahu to end war in Gaza\n                 \n                  More than 160 people still missing after deadly Texas floods\n                 Amid those positive comments, videos emerged highlighting flooding in the centre, with electricity cables covered with water on the day of the tour. The flooding was said to have been caused by a small storm. However, the state department claims the structures and tents can withstand category two hurricanes, reaching 110mph winds. FDEM spokesperson Stephanie Hartman wrote in a statement that \"vendors had tightened any seams at the base of the structures that allowed water to come in during the storm\". She described the water intrusion as minimal. Steff Gaulter, a Sky News meteorologist, said: \"In the last 10 years, we've seen 13 hurricanes that have hit Florida. Seven of them have been category three or higher. \"As well as needing to know how strong these storms are as they come, it's also very unpredictable, their track can change at the last minute.\" The American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE) and the Structural Engineering Institute (SEI) have said structures in risk category two - which Alligator Alcatraz falls under - need to withstand 121mph wind gusts. If the housing tents exceed 300 occupants per tent, the guidelines go up to 167mph. Ms Gaulter explained: \"You don't necessarily need a hurricane in order to see a gust of wind over 100mph. In the lowest category of hurricane, category one, the range of winds would be between 74mph and 95mph. But even in that category, you can easily get a gust of wind up to 120mph.\" Dr Patrick McSharry, Professor at Carnegie Mellon University and former head of catastrophe risk financing at Oxford University, told Sky News that in a hurricane \"there's no way that a tent is going to be in any way something that you would advise someone to be in\". \"It's more the case of having a plan in place that can be mobilised really fast to get people out of that dangerous situation.\" The site is also located in a hurricane-prone region as defined by ASCE. Discussing building regulations, Dr McSharry said: \"We're dealing here potentially with human lives so it's an even more sensitive calculation I think that needs to be made.\" Sky News put these concerns to Ron DeSantis and the Florida state department, but did not receive responses. White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson told Sky News: \"Alligator Alcatraz is a state-of-the-art facility that will play a critical role in fulfilling the president's promise to get the worst criminal illegal aliens out of America as fast as possible. \"President Trump is grateful to partner with [Homeland] Secretary [Kristi] Noem and Ron DeSantis on this important project.\" Satellite imagery obtained by Sky News shows the rapid construction of the centre, which was formerly Dade-Collier Training Airport. Five days after the centre was announced by Florida's attorney general James Uthmeier, more than 60 new trailers can be seen on the right-hand side of the runway. Satellite imagery obtained by Sky News also shows that from 24 June to the opening date on 1 July, more than seven large housing tents were put up at the site. The site is reportedly set to open with 3,000 beds, expanding to 5,000 by early July.   It is also reported that the site will cost an estimated $450m (£330m) per year to operate, with a bed costing $245 (£180) per day. The bill is reported to be covered by the state of Florida, which plans to get money back from the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and Department of Homeland Security (DHS). Tessa Petit, director of the Florida Immigrant Coalition, told Sky News: \"It was constructed too [quickly]. This is a sign that we're seeing a disaster [waiting to] happen as we look at it. \"Usual detention centres come up with, you know, their bricks and mortar, right? This is not bricks and mortar. This is just tents and mobile homes that are assembled on an airstrip.\" \"There's a detention of immigrants in a place that has been in the past ravaged by hurricanes and we're getting into hurricane season,\" Ms Petit added. She is concerned that medical support and sanitary provisions, like a sewage system, will not have been properly installed. \"You can't build a sewage system that can sustain 3,000 people in eight days. You can't dig in the Everglades. So, what are going be the additional sanitary conditions?\" she said. There are also sustainability concerns about the site. The Centre for Biological Diversity has filed a lawsuit in US District Court to protect the Florida Everglades. They state it is \"a reckless plan to build a massive detention centre for people caught in immigration raids\". Tania Galloni, an attorney working with the Centre for Biological Diversity, stated the proposed plan \"has not undergone the environmental review required by federal law, and the public has had no chance to provide feedback\".

Authorities also believe that evidence is pointing towards the vehicle \"significantly exceeding the speed limit for the highway\" at the time. The accident happened at 12.30am local time on Thursday (11.30pm Wednesday BST) on the A-52 motorway in the region of Cernadilla, Zamora. \"Among other things, the marks left by one of the vehicle's wheels are being examined,\" the statement from the Civil Guard in Zamora added.

Local media reported that the speed limit for the road is 120kph (74mph). Pictures following the crash showed debris scattered along the side of the road, including what appeared to be parts of the Lamborghini, which had veered off the road and burst into flames. Family and fans were joined by Liverpool stars past and present and members of Jota's national team for the funeral of the brothers in Portugal on Saturday.  Jota's wife Rute Cardoso, whom he had married just 11 days before the accident, and the footballer's parents, were among those at the service at the Igreja Matriz de Gondomar church in the town of Gondomar, near Porto. Flowers in the shape of football shirts were brought by Liverpool, featuring the brothers' shirt numbers. A number 20, to mark Jota's shirt number for Liverpool, was carried by captain Virgil van Dijk. Andy Robertson brought another featuring a number 30 in honour of Silva, who played in Portugal's second division with Penafiel.

        "Content": "\n          Social affairs and health reporter\n              @megbaynes\n The first malaria treatment for babies and young children has been approved for use. The treatment is dissolvable, including in breast milk, and has a sweet cherry flavour to make it easier to administer. Eight countries took part in a trial for the new treatment - Burkina Faso, Cote d'Ivoire, Kenya, Malawi, Mozambique, Nigeria, Tanzania and Uganda - and it is expected to be rolled out across Africa in a matter of weeks. Until now, there has been no approved malaria treatment for infants weighing less than 4.5kg (around 10lb). Instead, young infants have been treated with versions made for older children. This brought with it a risk of overdose, because infant livers are not fully developed. \"The available malaria treatments have only been properly tested in children aged at least six months because smaller infants are usually excluded from treatment trials,\" said Professor Umberto D'Alessandro, from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. The new dose strength designed for young infants was developed by Novartis, with scientific and financial support from MMV, a Swiss non-profit working to treat, prevent and eliminate malaria. \n                  Mosquitoes being genetically modified to kill the malaria parasite they carry\n                 \n                  Over half of world's population could be at risk of mosquito-borne diseases, experts warn\n                 \n                  What 2023 has taught us about... science and technology \n                 Around 30 million babies are born in areas of malaria risk every year, with one survey reporting infections ranging between 3.4% and 18.4% in infants less than six months old. The drug, known as Coartem Baby or Riamet Baby, will be available on a largely not-for-profit basis. In March, scientists said they were genetically modifying mosquitoes in a bid to stop the spread of the disease. It would mean a mosquito bite in regions of the world where the disease is endemic no longer carries a potential death sentence. It comes as scientists warned more than half of the world's population could be at risk of catching diseases transmitted by mosquitoes such as malaria and dengue by the end of the century"

        "Content": " Israel's prime minister has nominated Donald Trump for the Nobel Peace Prize. Benjamin Netanyahu made the announcement at a White House dinner, handing over the letter for the US president to read. \"Coming from you in particular, this is very meaningful,\" Mr Trump said. The Israeli leader said Mr Trump was \"forging peace as we speak, and one country and one region after the other\". Organisers award the prize to the person who does the most for \"fraternity between nations, for the abolition or reduction of standing armies and for the holding and promotion of peace congresses\". Mr Trump took credit for stopping Iran and Israel's \"12-day war\" last month, announcing it with fanfare on Truth Social, and the ceasefire has so far held. The president has claimed US strikes obliterated Iran's purported nuclear weapons programme - and that the country now wants to restart negotiations. \"We have scheduled Iran talks, and they want to,\" Mr Trump told reporters on Monday. \"They want to talk.\" 👉 Follow Trump100 on your podcast app 👈 Iran hasn't confirmed the move, but its president told US broadcaster Tucker Carlson he believes his country can resolve differences with the US through dialogue. Masoud Pezeshkian also said Iran would be willing to resume cooperation with the UN nuclear watchdog. However, he said full access to nuclear sites wasn't yet possible as US strikes had damaged them so badly.  Away from Iran, fighting continues in Gaza and Ukraine. Mr Trump famously boasted before his second stint in the White House that he could end the Ukraine war in 24 hours. The reality has been very different - with Ukraine saying last week that Russia unleashed the heaviest aerial attack of the war so far. Critics have also claimed Vladimir Putin is \"playing\" his US counterpart and that he has no intention of agreeing a ceasefire.  However, Mr Trump could try to take credit for progress in Gaza if - as he's suggested - an agreement on a 60-day ceasefire is done this week. Indirect negotiations with Hamas are taking place that could lead to the release of some of the remaining 50 Israeli hostages and a surge in aid to Gaza. The White House said Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff is travelling to Qatar this week to try to seal the agreement. Read more:Israeli soldier describes arbitrary killing of civilians in GazaIDF troops 'psychologically broken' after Gaza - UN expert  Whether a temporary pause could open a path to a lasting peace remains uncertain, with the two sides' criteria for peace still far apart. Mr Netanyahu has said Hamas must surrender, disarm and leave Gaza - something it refuses to do. He also told reporters on Monday that the US and Israel were working with other countries who would give Palestinians \"a better future\" - and indicated those in Gaza could move elsewhere. \"If people want to stay, they can stay, but if they want to leave, they should be able to leave,\" he added. \"We've had great cooperation from... surrounding countries, great cooperation from every single one of them. So something good will happen,\" Mr Trump said. The president was widely criticised earlier this year when he suggested resettling Gaza's population to countries such as Jordan and Egypt and turning it into the \"Riviera of the Middle East\". Human rights groups said the plan amounted to ethnic cleansing and most Gazans said they would never consider leaving."

One US source said: \"The US pressure on Israel has begun, and tonight it will be heavy.\" The source, who is not authorised to speak publicly, was referring to the White House dinner on Monday night between Trump and Netanyahu. A second Middle Eastern diplomatic source agreed that the American pressure on Israel would be intense. Netanyahu arrived in Washington DC in the early hours of Monday morning and held meetings on Monday with Steve Witkoff, Trump's Middle East envoy, and Marco Rubio, the secretary of state and national security adviser. The Israeli prime minister plans to be in Washington until Thursday with meetings on Capitol Hill on Tuesday. Trump has made clear his desire to bring the Gaza conflict to an end. However, he has never articulated how a lasting peace, which would satisfy both the Israelis and Palestinians, could be achieved. His varying comments about ownership of Gaza, moving Palestinians out of the territory and permanent resettlement, have presented a confusing policy.  Situation for Palestinians worse than ever Over the coming days, we will see the extent to which Trump demands that Netanyahu accepts the current Gaza ceasefire deal, even if it falls short of Israel's war aims - the elimination of Hamas. The strategic objective to permanently remove Hamas seems always to have been impossible. Hamas as an entity was the extreme consequence of the Israeli occupation. The Palestinians' challenge has not gone away, and the situation for Palestinians now is worse than it has ever been in Gaza and also the West Bank. It is not clear how Trump plans to square that circle.

Those close to him often emphasise this. He is also looking to cement his legacy as a peacemaker. He genuinely craves the Nobel Peace Prize. In this context, the complexities of conflicts - in Ukraine or Gaza - are often of secondary importance to the president. If Netanyahu can be persuaded to end the war, what would he need? The hostages back - for sure. That would require agreement from Hamas. They would only agree to this if they have guarantees on Gaza's future and their own future. More circles to square.

Two powerful men in the Blue Room of the White House, deciding the direction of the region. Will it be seen as the moment the region was remoulded? But to whose benefit? Trump is a dealmaker with an eye on the prize. But Netanyahu is a political master; they don't call him \"the magician\" for nothing. Trump makes decisions instinctively. He can shift position quickly and often listens to the last person in the room. Right now - that person is Netanyahu. Gaza is one part of a jigsaw of challenges, which could become opportunities. Diplomatic normalisation between Israel and the Arab world is a prize for Trump and could genuinely secure him the Nobel Peace Prize. But without the Gaza piece, the jigsaw is incomplete."

He said among the missing were five children and one counsellor from Camp Mystic - where at least 27 people were killed in the flash flooding. At least 109 people are confirmed to have died in the floods, which took place on the 4 July weekend, but this figure has been steadily climbing ever since. The bulk of deaths, and the main search for additional bodies, have been concentrated in Kerr County and the city of Kerrville. The area was transformed into a disaster zone when torrential rains struck the region early last Friday, unleashing deadly flooding along the Guadalupe River. The likes of Travis County, Kendall County, Burnett County, Williamson County, and Tom Green County were also hit. Mr Abbot said many of those who were unaccounted for were in the Texas Hill Country area, but had not registered at a camp or hotel, posing further challenges for authorities. Camp Mystic Mr Abbot planned to make another visit to Camp Mystic. The century-old all-girls Christian summer camp was badly hit by the flash floods, with at least 27 campers and counsellors dying. There were scenes of devastation at the camp as the flood water receded. Outside the cabins where the girls had slept, mud-splattered blankets and pillows were scattered.

Their aunt, Jennifer Harber, wrote in a detailed statement on a GoFundMe page for the family that the sisters' \"hands were locked together\" when rescuers found them about 15 miles downstream. She said they had been staying in a cabin with their grandparents along the river, while their mother and father, Annie and RJ, were lodged farther up the hill, away from the water. On the GoFundMe page, which was set up on Saturday, Ms Harber said the girls' parents were safe, but their grandparents Mike and Charlene had still not been found.

        "Content": "By Freya Gibson and Sophia Massam, Data and Forensics team   Videos and satellite imagery show how quickly Donald Trump's detention centre in Florida has been constructed - as experts suggest the design of the site is flawed and will compromise the safety of people being held there.\n  Sky News' Data and Forensics team has verified footage posted on social media that shows water covering the ground near electricity cables during a storm as the first detainees were due to arrive. The Florida Division of Emergency Management (FDEM), run by Governor Ron DeSantis, posted on X that detainees were at the site on 3 July just before 1pm local time (6pm UK time). Donald Trump held a tour of the facility on 1 July that took journalists around \"Alligator Alcatraz\". Its name is a reference to both the local reptile population and the former maximum-security Alcatraz Federal Penitentiary in San Francisco Bay, California. The tour showed the rapid construction of the centre, designed to accommodate up to 3,000 detainees. The purpose of the site is to house individuals detained by US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). James Uthmeier, Florida's attorney general, posted on X: \"And in just a week, Alligator Alcatraz was built.\" Political commentator Benny Johnson, who was on the tour, praised the eight-day turnaround. \"I don't think anyone realises how impressive Alligator Alcatraz is,\" he said. \n                  Benjamin Netanyahu nominates Donald Trump for Nobel Peace Prize - as Gaza ceasefire talks continue \n                 \n                  Trump applying 'heavy pressure' on Netanyahu to end war in Gaza\n                 \n                  More than 160 people still missing after deadly Texas floods\n                 Amid those positive comments, videos emerged highlighting flooding in the centre, with electricity cables covered with water on the day of the tour. The flooding was said to have been caused by a small storm. However, the state department claims the structures and tents can withstand category two hurricanes, reaching 110mph winds. FDEM spokesperson Stephanie Hartman wrote in a statement that \"vendors had tightened any seams at the base of the structures that allowed water to come in during the storm\". She described the water intrusion as minimal. Steff Gaulter, a Sky News meteorologist, said: \"In the last 10 years, we've seen 13 hurricanes that have hit Florida. Seven of them have been category three or higher. \"As well as needing to know how strong these storms are as they come, it's also very unpredictable, their track can change at the last minute.\" The American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE) and the Structural Engineering Institute (SEI) have said structures in risk category two - which Alligator Alcatraz falls under - need to withstand 121mph wind gusts. If the housing tents exceed 300 occupants per tent, the guidelines go up to 167mph. Ms Gaulter explained: \"You don't necessarily need a hurricane in order to see a gust of wind over 100mph. In the lowest category of hurricane, category one, the range of winds would be between 74mph and 95mph. But even in that category, you can easily get a gust of wind up to 120mph.\" Dr Patrick McSharry, Professor at Carnegie Mellon University and former head of catastrophe risk financing at Oxford University, told Sky News that in a hurricane \"there's no way that a tent is going to be in any way something that you would advise someone to be in\". \"It's more the case of having a plan in place that can be mobilised really fast to get people out of that dangerous situation.\" The site is also located in a hurricane-prone region as defined by ASCE. Discussing building regulations, Dr McSharry said: \"We're dealing here potentially with human lives so it's an even more sensitive calculation I think that needs to be made.\" Sky News put these concerns to Ron DeSantis and the Florida state department, but did not receive responses. White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson told Sky News: \"Alligator Alcatraz is a state-of-the-art facility that will play a critical role in fulfilling the president's promise to get the worst criminal illegal aliens out of America as fast as possible. \"President Trump is grateful to partner with [Homeland] Secretary [Kristi] Noem and Ron DeSantis on this important project.\" Satellite imagery obtained by Sky News shows the rapid construction of the centre, which was formerly Dade-Collier Training Airport. Five days after the centre was announced by Florida's attorney general James Uthmeier, more than 60 new trailers can be seen on the right-hand side of the runway. Satellite imagery obtained by Sky News also shows that from 24 June to the opening date on 1 July, more than seven large housing tents were put up at the site. The site is reportedly set to open with 3,000 beds, expanding to 5,000 by early July.   It is also reported that the site will cost an estimated $450m (£330m) per year to operate, with a bed costing $245 (£180) per day. The bill is reported to be covered by the state of Florida, which plans to get money back from the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and Department of Homeland Security (DHS). Tessa Petit, director of the Florida Immigrant Coalition, told Sky News: \"It was constructed too [quickly]. This is a sign that we're seeing a disaster [waiting to] happen as we look at it. \"Usual detention centres come up with, you know, their bricks and mortar, right? This is not bricks and mortar. This is just tents and mobile homes that are assembled on an airstrip.\" \"There's a detention of immigrants in a place that has been in the past ravaged by hurricanes and we're getting into hurricane season,\" Ms Petit added. She is concerned that medical support and sanitary provisions, like a sewage system, will not have been properly installed. \"You can't build a sewage system that can sustain 3,000 people in eight days. You can't dig in the Everglades. So, what are going be the additional sanitary conditions?\" she said. There are also sustainability concerns about the site. The Centre for Biological Diversity has filed a lawsuit in US District Court to protect the Florida Everglades. They state it is \"a reckless plan to build a massive detention centre for people caught in immigration raids\". Tania Galloni, an attorney working with the Centre for Biological Diversity, stated the proposed plan \"has not undergone the environmental review required by federal law, and the public has had no chance to provide feedback\".

        "Content": "\n          Business and economics correspondent\n              @pkelso\n  At least 13 people may have taken their own lives after being accused of wrongdoing based on evidence from the Horizon IT system that the Post Office and developers Fujitsu knew could be false, the public inquiry has found. A further 59 people told the inquiry they considered ending their lives, 10 of whom tried on at least one occasion, while other postmasters and family members recount suffering from alcoholism and mental health disorders including anorexia and depression, family breakup, divorce, bankruptcy and personal abuse. Follow latest on public inquiry into Post Office scandal Writing in the first volume of the Post Office Horizon IT Inquiry report, chairman Sir Wyn Williams concludes that this enormous personal toll came despite senior employees at the Post Office knowing the Horizon IT system could produce accounts \"which were illusory rather than real\" even before it was rolled out to branches. Sir Wyn said: \"I am satisfied from the evidence that I have heard that a number of senior, and not so senior, employees of the Post Office knew or, at the very least, should have known that Legacy Horizon was capable of error… Yet, for all practical purposes, throughout the lifetime of Legacy Horizon, the Post Office maintained the fiction that its data was always accurate.\"  Referring to the updated version of Horizon, known as Horizon Online, which also had \"bugs errors and defects\" that could create illusory accounts, he said: \"I am satisfied that a number of employees of Fujitsu and the Post Office knew that this was so.\" The first volume of the report focuses on what Sir Wyn calls the \"disastrous\" impact of false accusations made against at least 1,000 postmasters, and the various redress schemes the Post Office and government has established since miscarriages of justice were identified and proven. Recommendations regarding the conduct of senior management of the Post Office, Fujitsu and ministers will come in a subsequent report, but Sir Wyn is clear that unjust and flawed prosecutions were knowingly pursued. \"All of these people are properly to be regarded as victims of wholly unacceptable behaviour perpetrated by a number of individuals employed by and/or associated with the Post Office and Fujitsu from time to time and by the Post Office and Fujitsu as institutions,\" he says.  What are the inquiry's recommendations? Calling for urgent action from government and the Post Office to ensure \"full and fair compensation\", he makes 19 recommendations including: • Government and the Post Office to agree a definition of \"full and fair\" compensation to be used when agreeing payouts• Ending \"unnecessarily adversarial attitude\" to initial offers that have depressed the value of payouts, ⁠and ensuring consistency across all four compensation schemes• The creation of a standing body to administer financial redress to people wronged by public bodies• Compensation to be extended to close family members of those affected who have suffered \"serious negative consequences\"• The Post Office, Fujitsu and government agreeing a programme for \"restorative justice\", a process that brings together those that have suffered harm with those that have caused it Regarding the human impact of the Post Office's pursuit of postmasters, including its use of unique powers of prosecution, Sir Wyn writes: \"I do not think it is easy to exaggerate the trauma which persons are likely to suffer when they are the subject of criminal investigation, prosecution, conviction and sentence.\" He says that even the process of being interviewed under caution by Post Office investigators \"will have been troubling at best and harrowing at worst\". 👉 Listen to Sky News Daily on your podcast app 👈 'Hostile and abusive behaviour' The report finds that those wrongfully convicted were \"subject to hostile and abusive behaviour\" in their local communities, felt shame and embarrassment, with some feeling forced to move. Detailing the impact on close family members of those prosecuted, Sir Wyn writes: \"Wives, husbands, children and parents endured very significant suffering in the form of distress, worry and disruption to home life, in employment and education. \"In a number of cases, relationships with spouses broke down and ended in divorce or separation. \"In the most egregious cases, family members themselves suffered psychiatric illnesses or psychological problems and very significant financial losses… their suffering has been acute.\"  The report includes 17 case studies of those affected by the scandal including some who have never spoken publicly before. They include Millie Castleton, daughter of Lee Castleton, one of the first postmasters prosecuted. She told the inquiry how her family being \"branded thieves and liars\" affected her mental health, and contributed to a diagnosis of anorexia that forced her to drop out of university. Her account concludes: \"Even now as I go into my career, I still find it so incredibly hard to trust anyone, even subconsciously. I sabotage myself by not asking for help with anything. \"I'm trying hard to break this cycle but I'm 26 and am very conscious that I may never be able to fully commit to natural trust. But my family is still fighting. I'm still fighting, as are many hundreds involved in the Post Office trial.\" Read more:Analysis: Inquiry's heart-breaking legacySir Alan Bates calls for justice for victims Fujitsu has 'moral obligation' to pay-up Responding to criticism about victims suffering long delays before receiving compensation, Post Office minister, Gareth Thomas, told Sky News that he accepted that payments should have been made sooner and pledged \"to go further and faster\" in future. \"We've been working on the initial scope of a scheme to compensate family members that were very closely associated with those who suffered most as a result of the scandal,\" he said. Mr Thomas added that it was not acceptable that compensation was effectively being paid by taxpayers, while Fujitsu had not made any contributions. \"We have underlined that in face-to-face meetings with them. To be fair, they have accepted that they have that moral obligation. \"We have made clear to them that we think they should make an interim payment ahead of Sir Wynne's final report, which will set out the degree of culpability of all sorts of the players in this terrible scandal, including the role of Fujitsu,\" he said. Inquiry findings 'important milestone' Business Secretary Jonathan Reynolds said the inquiry's report \"marks an important milestone for sub-postmasters and their families\". He added that he was \"committed to ensuring wronged sub-postmasters are given full, fair, and prompt redress\". \"The recommendations contained in Sir Wyn's report require careful reflection, including on further action to complete the redress schemes,\" Mr Reynolds said. \"Government will promptly respond to the recommendations in full in parliament.\" Anyone feeling emotionally distressed or suicidal can call Samaritans for help on 116 123 or email jo@samaritans.org in the UK.

        "Content": " The UK's public finances are in a \"relatively vulnerable position\", the government's official forecaster has warned.\n The Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) cited a drag from successive economic shocks, recent U-turns on spending cuts and higher-than-expected policy commitments. It sounded alarm over the projected path for debt as a result, in its annual fiscal risks and sustainability report. It saw total debt above 270% of gross domestic product (GDP) by the early 2070s - up from a current level of 96.5% - declaring that rising debts have led to \"a substantial erosion of the UK's capacity to respond to future shocks\". Money latest: Amazon launches 24/7 grocery deliveries The OBR's report highlighted damage from the COVID pandemic and cost of living crisis that followed Russia's invasion of Ukraine. But it raised fears that past and current government policies were further harming the sustainability of the public finances. \n                  Building societies step up protest against Reeves's cash ISA reforms\n                 \n                  Reeves's tax turmoil deepens\n                 \n                  Rachel Reeves hints at tax rises in autumn budget after welfare bill U-turn\n                 The report said that the pension triple lock, for example, was now estimated to cost £15.5bn annually by 2029-30. That was \"around three times higher than initial expectations\", it said. The lock, which rises each year in line with inflation, wage growth or 2.5% - whichever is higher - had risen by more than the 2.5% base in eight of the 13 years of operation to date, the report stated. The watchdog said it reflected more volatile inflation than expected. It also picked up on the latest government U-turns over planned welfare and winter fuel payment cuts in the face of rebellions by Labour MPs.  The decisions are expected to leave Chancellor Rachel Reeves facing a black hole of £6.75bn while weaker-than-expected economic growth could add a further £9bn to that sum in the run-up to the autumn budget, according to Sky News projections that see a void of around £20bn. The OBR highlighted future risks from rising defence spending and the impact of climate change. Public sector pay demands could also prove a drag, with resident doctors voting in favour of strikes over pay. While ministers acknowledge damage to the public purse from the U-turns, Ms Reeves has repeatedly ruled out a new wave of borrowing to fund a spending spree.  As such, the government has not ruled out the prospect of some form of wealth tax to help meet its commitments despite the top 1% of earners contributing almost a third of all income tax already - on top of other targeted taxes such as capital gains. The report said: \"Efforts to put the UK's public finances on a more sustainable footing have met with only limited and temporary success in recent years in the aftermath of the shocks, debt has also continued to rise and borrowing remained elevated because governments have reversed plans to consolidate the public finances. \"Planned tax rises have been reversed, and, more significantly, planned spending reductions have been abandoned.\" Shadow chancellor Mel Stride said of the report: \"The OBR's report lays bare the damage: Britain now has the third-highest deficit and the fourth-highest debt burden in Europe, with borrowing costs among the highest in the developed world. \"Under Rachel Reeves' economic mismanagement and Keir Starmer's weak leadership, our public finances have become dangerously exposed - vulnerable to future shocks, welfare spending rising unsustainably, taxes rising to record highs and crippling levels of debt interest. \"Labour's recklessness risks it all - your pension, your job, your home, your savings.\" A Number 10 spokesman said: \"We recognise the realities set out in the OBR's report and we're taking the decisions needed to provide stability to the public finances.\""

Donald Trump had insisted that unless Britain could finalise the details of its metals trade deal with the US by 9 July, he would raise the tariffs faced by steel and aluminium imports from the 25% the UK currently pays to the 50% paid by other countries. If it could seal the deal, those tariffs could drop to zero. Money blog: 10 happiest and unhappiest professions for shift workers However, despite weeks of negotiations and promises that the deal would be completed by the end of June, talks have foundered on two key issues. First, the US is insisting that only steel \"melted and poured\" in the UK (in other words, forged in blast furnaces or electric arc furnaces) can be included in the deal. However, one of Britain's biggest steel exporters to the US, Tata Steel, is not melting and pouring its UK steel because of the closure of its blast furnaces. Second, the US is wary of the fact that while the government has taken control of British Steel, which operates Britain's last remaining blast furnaces in Scunthorpe, the company itself still legally has Chinese owners. Government insiders have told businesses they still expect to have a deal done by the end of this month, and that they are confident the White House will not impose the 50% tariffs for the time being. They say one of the chief challenges they face is that the administration is so overwhelmed by attempts to negotiate with other countries that they lack the bandwidth to deal with the small print on Britain's deal.  \"As far as the Americans are concerned, the UK is already a done deal,\" said one person close to the negotiations. The problem is that while a deal has been done on car and aerospace exports to the US, the metals element of the trade agreement is still some way from being signed. In the meantime, steel exports continue to incur tariffs - albeit lower than those imposed on other countries around the world."

Sky News has learnt that potential buyers of the Lincolnshire site were contacted on Monday by the restructuring experts hired when the refinery's parent, State Oil, collapsed into insolvency proceedings early last week.

Speaking publicly for the first time since the attack, Archie Norman declined to answer whether the business had paid a ransom. \"It's a business decision, it's a principal decision,\" he told members of the Business and Trade Committee (BTC). \"The question you have to ask is - and I think all businesses should ask - is, when they look at the demand, what are they getting for it? \"Because once your systems are compromised and you're going to have to rebuild anyway, maybe they've got exfiltrated data that you don't want to publish. Maybe there's something there, but in our case, substantially the damage had been done.\" When asked again later, Mr Norman said: \"We're not discussing any of the details of our interaction with the threat actor, including this subject, but that subject is fully shared with the NCA [National Crime Agency].\" He added: \"We don't think it's in the public interest to go into that subject on it, because it is a matter of law enforcement.\" The initial entry into M&S's systems took place on 17 April through \"sophisticated impersonation\" that involved a third party, Mr Norman said. It was two days later, on Easter Saturday, before the company became aware of the attack, and approximately a week after the intrusion before the retailer heard directly from the attacker.  A day later, after learning of the attack, the authorities were notified, while customers were told on Tuesday 22 April, MPs heard. As well as British authorities, the FBI was contacted, which is \"more muscled up in this zone\" and was \"very supportive\", Mr Norman said.

Sir Wyn Williams's first report documents with stark clarity how hundreds of sub-postmasters, wrongly accused of theft and fraud due to the faulty Horizon IT system, lost their livelihoods, homes, reputations - and in some cases, their lives. Follow Post Office inquiry latest Thirteen people are believed to have taken their lives as a result of the scandal. Fifty-nine contemplated it. It talks of alcohol addiction, serious mental illness, and bankruptcy - all tearing families apart and leaving behind a heartbreaking legacy. But if the scandal was a failure of justice, the response to it has become a second injustice. \n                  Anorexia, bankruptcy, suicide – how the Horizon IT system ruined lives\n                 \n                  At least 13 people may have taken their own lives linked to Post Office scandal, public inquiry finds\n                 \n                  Daughters of woman wrongly convicted in Post Office scandal reveal 'human impact' on family\n                 Critical on a technical level The report is critical, on a fairly technical level, about the complexity, delays, and bureaucracy of redress schemes that have left victims still waiting years for full compensation.  Hundreds of whom have died before seeing \"full and fair redress\". While Sir Wyn is fair to the government and the Post Office in stating that he believes their commitment to delivering the above has been in \"good faith\", he concludes this has not been achieved for every victim, describing \"formidable\" difficulties. There are 19 recommendations - including a push to ensure consistency across all four redress schemes, with an agreed and public definition of \"full and fair redress\". Compensation  Among them, that family members of victims should be compensated, and a permanent public body established to manage future redress schemes in future. Additionally, Fujitsu, the Post Office, and the government should engage in formal restorative justice programmes. There was also a flavour of what is to come in the final report later this year or next. The report has found that both Fujitsu and Post Office staff knew Horizon could produce false data but concealed this, maintaining a false narrative of accuracy. One of the most important things now, though, is how and when the government, Post Office, and Fujitsu respond officially. Sir Wyn has also set a deadline of 10 October 2025 for that. The victims of this scandal have waited long enough."

        "Content": "\n          City editor\n              @MarkKleinmanSky\n The private equity backers of David Lloyd Leisure, the premium health and fitness clubs chain, are close to finalising a £2bn deal that will see it continue as the company's long-term owner. Sky News has learnt that TDR Capital, which has owned David Lloyd Leisure since 2013, is putting the finishing touches to a so-called continuation vehicle which effectively transfers ownership of the group from one of its funds to another entity which has many of the same investors. Banking sources said that TDR had lined up a string of major new investors to help fund the £800m of equity commitments required to finance the deal. Post Office latest: Reaction to inquiry's first report The remaining £1.2bn is in the form of David Lloyd Leisure's existing debt rolling over to the continuation vehicle. One banking source said on Tuesday that there had been over £1bn of demand for the equity portion of the transaction. David Lloyd Leisure is one of Europe's biggest health and fitness operators, with 134 clubs and more than 11,500 employees. \n                  At least 13 people may have taken their own lives linked to Post Office scandal, public inquiry finds\n                 \n                  Public finances in 'relatively vulnerable position', OBR warns\n                 \n                  UK to miss deadline to agree steel and aluminium tariffs\n                 Under TDR's ownership, it has expanded its site numbers by 50%, including opening 30 venues in mainland Europe. In its last financial year, it recorded earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation of just over £230m - a one-third rise on the previous year. The chain now boasts more than 800,000 members, as of last month. People close to the company said its investment in spas and the introduction of popular wellness concepts such as meditation, yoga and tai chi have been partly responsible for its improved performance. They added that it had a strong pipeline of new clubs both in the UK and Europe, with 30 new openings planned in the coming years, and proposals to open more than 200 Padel courts across its sites. The decision to transfer ownership of David Lloyd Leisure to a continuation vehicle would allow new and existing investors the opportunity to benefit from future growth, according to insiders. It also offers limited partners, or investors, in the TDR fund in which David Lloyd Leisure is currently held the opportunity to realise their investment. TDR, which also owns Asda and Stonegate Group, Britain's biggest pub company, has explored a sale of David Lloyd Leisure in the past, including recently, but did not attract offers of a sufficient value, according to bankers. Jefferies is advising TDR on the continuation vehicle - which has become an increasingly common way for private equity firms to resolve issues relating to the ownership of long-held assets - and its negotiations with investors. A TDR spokesman declined to comment."

Sky News has learnt that Mubadala is in advanced discussions to acquire shares in the company from existing investors. If completed, the transaction would add to a smaller stake in Revolut which was bought by the Abu Dhabi fund last year as part of a wider secondary transaction. Money blog: 10 happiest and unhappiest professions for shift workers Mubadala, which declined to comment on Tuesday, is said to be keen to buy further Revolut shares when they become available, reflecting its confidence in the fintech's ability to attract a significantly higher valuation in future. The identity of the selling shareholders was unclear, although Balderton, the technology investor which has backed Revolut since early in its existence, is said to be among those which have been keen to monetise a chunk of their holdings. Revolut announced a secondary share sale nearly a year ago, which saw founder and chief executive Nik Storonsky reap a windfall worth hundreds of millions of pounds by selling a small proportion of his shareholding. \n                  Santander bank deal could mean TSB name disappears from UK high street\n                 \n                  NatWest boss thanks British taxpayer for 2008 bailout after government sells remaining shares\n                 \n                  Treasury holds talks with fintech unicorns about London IPO prospects\n                 Major tech investors including SoftBank, Coatue and D1 Capital Partners are also among Revolut's shareholders. The Financial Times recently reported that Mr Storonsky was in line for a multibillion-dollar payout if he succeeds in attaining a $150bn valuation for the company he set up a decade ago. Revolut is in the latter stages of activating a UK banking licence awarded after fraught discussions between the company and regulators nearly a year ago. \"We are progressing through the final stages of mobilisation and continue to work constructively with the [Prudential Regulation Authority],\" a spokesperson said. \"Given Revolut's global scale, this is the largest and most complex mobilisation ever undertaken in the UK. \"A thorough review is an expected part of the process and getting this right is more important than rushing to meet a specific date. \"We are looking forward to launching a fully regulated UK bank for our millions of UK customers this year.\" Revolut now boasts roughly 50 million customers globally. Founded in 2015, it has experienced a string of regulatory and compliance challenges, with reports last year highlighting its release of funds from accounts flagged by the National Crime Agency as suspicious. The company's growth has taken place at breakneck speed, with customer numbers soaring from 16.4 million at the point of the Series E fundraising just over three years ago. Attention has begun to shift to when and where Revolut will decide to become a public company. New York is expected to be the preferred choice of its board and leading investors, with Mr Storonsky suggesting that London would be an illogical listing venue for a company of Revolut's profile. Revolut is chaired by Martin Gilbert, the City veteran who previously ran Aberdeen Asset Management. Its other directors include Michael Sherwood, the former Goldman Sachs executive who was jointly responsible for its operations outside the US and who was regarded as one of the most skilled traders of his generation. Revolut declined to comment on Mubadala's additional stake purchase."

That story - the conflict and a historic Anglo-French agreement that ended centuries of feuding, the Entente Cordiale - adorn the walls of this great hall. Looming over the hundreds of MPs and peers who had gathered in the heat to hear the French president speak, hang two monumental paintings depicting British victories in the Napoleonic wars, while the glass stand in the room commemorates the 408 Lords who lost their lives fighting for Europe in two world wars. Politics latest: UK and France will get 'tangible results' on migration The French president came to parliament as the first European leader to be honoured with a state visit since Brexit. It was the first address of a French president to parliament since 2008, and Mr Macron used it to mark what he called a new era in Anglo-Franco relations.  Peers and MPs cheered with delight when he confirmed France would loan the Bayeux Tapestry to the UK in the run-up to the anniversary of William the Conqueror's birthday. \"I have to say, it took properly more years to deliver that project than all the Brexit texts,\" he joked as former prime minister Theresa May watched on from the front row From Brexit to migration, European security, to a two-state solution and the recognition of Palestine, Mr Macron did not shy away from thorny issues, as he turned the page on Brexit tensions woven through Anglo-French relations in recent years, in what one peer described to me as a \"very political speech rather than just the usual warm words\". He also used this address to praise Sir Keir Starmer, sitting in the audience, for his leadership on security and Ukraine, and his commitment to the international order and alliances forged from the ashes of the Second World War. For that, he received a loud ovation from the gathered parliamentarians.  Read more:Thatcher loyalist Norman Tebitt dies aged 94Public finances in 'relatively vulnerable position' The test now for Sir Keir is whether he can turn his deft diplomatic work in recent months with Mr Macron into concrete action to give him a much-needed win on the domestic front, particularly after his torrid week on welfare. The government hopes that France's aim for \"cooperation and tangible results\" at the upcoming political summit as part of this state visit, will give Starmer a much-needed boost. The PM is attempting to drive-down crossings by negotiating a one-in one-out return treaty with France. Under this plan, those crossing the Channel illegally will be sent back to France in exchange for Britain taking in an asylum seeker with a family connection in the UK. But as I understand it, the deal is still in the balance, with some EU countries unhappy about France and the UK agreeing on a bilateral deal."

        "Content": "\n          Political correspondent\n              @tamcohen\n A UN committee on disability rights has criticised the UK government's welfare reforms, saying they will \"increase poverty rates\".  In an intervention likely to be seized on by MPs seeking to further water down the measures, the committee asks ministers for answers on 10 issues surrounding the benefit changes - and says the reforms risk \"regression\" for disabled people. The committee, which reports to the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights, asks about British politicians suggesting people are defrauding the benefits system. One point on which it wants clarification is: \"Public statements by politicians and authorities portraying persons with disabilities as making profit of social benefits, making false statements to get social and disability benefits or being a burden to society.\" Other questions are on the impact the measures will have on \"young persons, new claimants of disability benefits, women with disabilities, persons with disabilities with high level supports\" and others. They ask ministers about what measures they have taken to address \"the foreseeable risk of increasing poverty rates amongst persons with disabilities if cuts are approved\" and claim the welfare bill has had \"limited scrutiny\". The letter claims that the committee has \"received credible information\" that the Universal Credit and Personal Independent Payment Bill \"will deepen the signs of regression\" that the committee warned about in a report last year on the cost of living crisis and its impact on disabled people. \n                  Wealth tax may not be fully formed proposal - but could be put in the mix\n                 \n                  Government declines to rule out wealth tax after ex-Labour leader Lord Kinnock calls for one\n                 \n                  Another tantrum from the Labour backbenches is inevitable\n                 An intervention by the UN will be an embarrassment to the government, which has promised its welfare reforms will help disabled people into work.  Liz Kendall, the welfare secretary, was criticised heavily earlier in the year for saying some people on benefits were \"taking the mickey\". After a chaotic first vote in Parliament on 1 July, in which MPs succeeded in watering down the reforms significantly, the government now says its reforms will lift 50,000 people out of poverty. The bill was backed by 335 MPs, with 260 against - a majority of 75. Read more:This has been PM's most damaging U-turn yetIs Starmer at the mercy of his MPs? The first version of the reforms would have - the government's assessment said - pushed 250,000 people into poverty. Charities are urging MPs to continue to push for further changes - including on cuts to Universal Credit sickness payments.  A different UN committee heavily criticised benefit changes made by the Conservatives in 2016 and called on the UK to take \"corrective measures\" when Labour came into office. The UN's committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (CESCR) concluded that \"welfare reform\" measures introduced by Conservative-led governments in 2012 and 2016 had disproportionately affected disabled people, low-income families, and workers in \"precarious employment\". The committee said this had led to \"severe economic hardship, increased reliance on food banks, homelessness, negative impacts on mental health, and the stigmatisation of benefit claimants\". The Department for Work and Pensions has been contacted for comment. The Universal Credit and Personal Independent Payment Bill returns to the Commons on Wednesday for its remaining stages. Mikey Erhardt, policy lead at Disability Rights UK, said: \"The fact that the UN has yet again felt it needs to write to the UK government about our cruel and punitive social security system should be a national shame. \"We hope this letter is a wake-up call for MPs. Despite all the chaos of the last-minute climbdowns and concessions, the Universal Credit bill remains broken. \"There are still billions of cuts on the table, and we urge MPs to approach tomorrow's proceedings with caution as their vote will have serious implications for disabled people across the country. \"If disabled people feel unable to trust the government's promises on co-production and the UN needed to raise concerns over the bill's impact, how can MPs vote this bill through?\""

        "Content": " Norman Tebbit, the former Tory minister who served in Margaret Thatcher's government, has died at the age of 94. Lord Tebbit died \"peacefully at home\" on Monday night, his son William confirmed. One of Mrs Thatcher's most loyal cabinet ministers, he was a leading political voice throughout the turbulent 1980s. Politics latest: Tributes paid to 'icon' Norman Tebbit He held the posts of employment secretary, trade secretary, Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster and Conservative Party chairman before resigning as an MP in 1992 after his wife was left disabled by the Provisional IRA's bombing of the Grand Hotel in Brighton. He considered standing for the Conservative leadership after Mrs Thatcher's resignation in 1990, but was committed to taking care of his wife. Tory leader Kemi Badenoch called him an \"icon\" in British politics and said he was \"one of the leading exponents of the philosophy we now know as Thatcherism\". \"But to many of us it was the stoicism and courage he showed in the face of terrorism, which inspired us as he rebuilt his political career after suffering terrible injuries in the Brighton bomb, and cared selflessly for his wife Margaret, who was gravely disabled in the bombing,\" she wrote on X. \"He never buckled under pressure and he never compromised. Our nation has lost one of its very best today and I speak for all the Conservative family and beyond in recognising Lord Tebbit's enormous intellect and profound sense of duty to his country. \"May he rest in peace.\" Read more:Norman Tebbit obituary: Thatcher loyalist and IRA bombing survivor Tory grandee David Davis told Sky News Lord Tebbit was a \"great working class Tory, always ready to challenge establishment conventional wisdom for the bogus nonsense it often was\". \"He was one of Thatcher's bravest and strongest lieutenants, and a great friend,\" Sir David said. \"He had to deal with the agony that the IRA visited on him and his wife, and he did so with characteristic unflinching courage. He was a great man.\" Reform leader Nigel Farage said Lord Tebbit \"gave me a lot of help in my early days as an MEP\". He was \"a great man. RIP,\" he added. Born to working-class parents in north London, he was made a life peer in 1992, a position he held until he retired in 2022. Lord Tebbit was trade secretary when he was injured in the Provisional IRA's bombing in Brighton during the Conservative Party conference in 1984. Five people died in the attack and Lord Tebbit's wife Margaret was left paralysed from the neck down. She died in 2020 at the age of 86. Before entering politics, his first job, aged 16, was at the Financial Times where he had his first experience of trade unions and vowed to \"break the power of the closed shop\". He then trained as a pilot with the RAF - at one point narrowly escaping from the burning cockpit of a jet - before becoming the MP for Epping in 1970, then for Chingford in 1974. As a cabinet minister, he was responsible for legislation that weakened the powers of the trade unions and the closed shop, making him the political embodiment of the Thatcherite ideology that was in full swing. His tough approach was put to the test when riots erupted in Brixton, south London, against the backdrop of high rates of unemployment and mistrust between the black community and the police. He was frequently misquoted as having told the unemployed to \"get on your bike\", and was often referred to as \"Onyerbike\" for some time afterwards. What he actually said was he grew up in the 1930s with an unemployed father who did not riot, \"he got on his bike and looked for work, and he kept looking 'til he found it\"."

        "Content": " The UK's public finances are in a \"relatively vulnerable position\", the government's official forecaster has warned.\n The Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) cited a drag from successive economic shocks, recent U-turns on spending cuts and higher-than-expected policy commitments. It sounded alarm over the projected path for debt as a result, in its annual fiscal risks and sustainability report. It saw total debt above 270% of gross domestic product (GDP) by the early 2070s - up from a current level of 96.5% - declaring that rising debts have led to \"a substantial erosion of the UK's capacity to respond to future shocks\". Money latest: Amazon launches 24/7 grocery deliveries The OBR's report highlighted damage from the COVID pandemic and cost of living crisis that followed Russia's invasion of Ukraine. But it raised fears that past and current government policies were further harming the sustainability of the public finances. \n                  Building societies step up protest against Reeves's cash ISA reforms\n                 \n                  Reeves's tax turmoil deepens\n                 \n                  Rachel Reeves hints at tax rises in autumn budget after welfare bill U-turn\n                 The report said that the pension triple lock, for example, was now estimated to cost £15.5bn annually by 2029-30. That was \"around three times higher than initial expectations\", it said. The lock, which rises each year in line with inflation, wage growth or 2.5% - whichever is higher - had risen by more than the 2.5% base in eight of the 13 years of operation to date, the report stated. The watchdog said it reflected more volatile inflation than expected. It also picked up on the latest government U-turns over planned welfare and winter fuel payment cuts in the face of rebellions by Labour MPs.  The decisions are expected to leave Chancellor Rachel Reeves facing a black hole of £6.75bn while weaker-than-expected economic growth could add a further £9bn to that sum in the run-up to the autumn budget, according to Sky News projections that see a void of around £20bn. The OBR highlighted future risks from rising defence spending and the impact of climate change. Public sector pay demands could also prove a drag, with resident doctors voting in favour of strikes over pay. While ministers acknowledge damage to the public purse from the U-turns, Ms Reeves has repeatedly ruled out a new wave of borrowing to fund a spending spree.  As such, the government has not ruled out the prospect of some form of wealth tax to help meet its commitments despite the top 1% of earners contributing almost a third of all income tax already - on top of other targeted taxes such as capital gains. The report said: \"Efforts to put the UK's public finances on a more sustainable footing have met with only limited and temporary success in recent years in the aftermath of the shocks, debt has also continued to rise and borrowing remained elevated because governments have reversed plans to consolidate the public finances. \"Planned tax rises have been reversed, and, more significantly, planned spending reductions have been abandoned.\" Shadow chancellor Mel Stride said of the report: \"The OBR's report lays bare the damage: Britain now has the third-highest deficit and the fourth-highest debt burden in Europe, with borrowing costs among the highest in the developed world. \"Under Rachel Reeves' economic mismanagement and Keir Starmer's weak leadership, our public finances have become dangerously exposed - vulnerable to future shocks, welfare spending rising unsustainably, taxes rising to record highs and crippling levels of debt interest. \"Labour's recklessness risks it all - your pension, your job, your home, your savings.\" A Number 10 spokesman said: \"We recognise the realities set out in the OBR's report and we're taking the decisions needed to provide stability to the public finances.\""

Politics latest: UK and France will get 'tangible results' on migration, President Macron says He once told me, when he was party chairman in the mid-1980s and I was working for The Sunday Times, about the snobbery in the party. \"They think I eat peas off my knife,\" he said. I think he was joking. He revelled in his reputation as a working-class bruiser. Labour's Michael Foot called him a \"semi house-trained pole cat\" and he was widely known as \"The Chingford Skinhead\". During the riots of 1981, he famously spoke of his father being unemployed in the 1930s. \"He didn't riot,\" he said. \"He got on his bike and looked for work.\" \n                  UK and France have 'shared responsibility' to tackle illegal migration, Emmanuel Macron says\n                 \n                  Can PM turn diplomatic work with Macron into concrete action on migration?\n                 \n                  Politics latest: King Charles says UK and France stand 'ever closer' as he hosts President Macron at state banquet\n                 I've been reporting at Westminster since 1982 and covered the Thatcher era when Norman Tebbit was a giant on the political stage throughout. When I started as a political journalist he had just been promoted to the cabinet in Mrs Thatcher's momentous reshuffle late in 1981. That was the reshuffle in which Mrs Thatcher purged the so-called \"wets\" in her cabinet and appointed true believers like Tebbit, Cecil Parkinson and Nigel Lawson. Like many incoming governments, hers had struggled in the early days, though perhaps not as badly as Sir Keir Starmer's is at the moment! In the early '80s, though, inflation and unemployment were both rampant. Even after the 1978-79 \"winter of discontent\" that brought down James Callaghan's Labour government, strikes were still crippling industry. Mrs Thatcher decided radical action was necessary. So she handed Tebbit the job of employment secretary: his job was to tame the power of the trade unions. He succeeded one of the cabinet \"wets\", the moderate James Prior, who had been branded \"Pussyfoot Prior\" by Tory-supporting newspapers over his perceived failure to take on the unions. He was exiled to Northern Ireland in the 1981 reshuffle. Parkinson became a charismatic party chairman and Lawson became energy secretary and later succeeded Sir Geoffrey Howe as chancellor. Tebbit had always been very anti-trade union, going back to his first job in the printing room of the Financial Times, where he had been forced to join a union, and then his days as a British Airways pilot. So as employment secretary, he introduced tough anti-trade union legislation, including outlawing the closed shop and making strike ballots compulsory. And, as Mrs Thatcher turned round the fortunes of her government following the 1982 Falklands War, he became one of the most senior members of the cabinet, and one of her most dependable allies. After the 1983 Tory landslide, she promoted him to trade and industry secretary, after Parkinson quit in a sex scandal after fathering a love child. But just as Tebbit was becoming one of the giants of the Thatcher government and being talked about as a potential successor as PM, his political career was cut short by the 1984 IRA attack on the Grand Hotel in Brighton. It was to be the defining moment of his career. Who can forget the images of him being rescued after he was trapped in the rubble? He was badly injured, spent three months in hospital and his wife Margaret was paralysed and spent the rest of her life in a wheelchair. Read more:Public finances in 'relatively vulnerable position', OBR warnsNine charts that tell us whether Labour's first year has been a success or failure Some political observers claimed he was never quite the same after his injuries and the sorrow and anger about his wife's condition. I don't think he lost any of his edge, however. He was still a great political campaigner and a bruiser. During the 1987 election, there was tension between Tebbit and Lord Young, another Thatcher favourite, over election strategy, although despite a \"wobbly Thursday\" during the campaign the Tories won handsomely again. My other personal memory of Lord Tebbit is breaking the story in the UK about his \"cricket test\" remarks about Asian supporters, in an interview with the Los Angeles Times in April 1990. He spoke about a test of how English someone from an ethnic minority background was by asking which cricket team they supported. \"Which side do they cheer for?\" he declared. \"It's an interesting question.\" The headline on my story on the front page of the late - and some would say unlamented - Today newspaper was \"Tebbit race bouncer. The ultimate test for being British: Which side do the Asians cheer for at cricket?\" He was strongly criticised for his remarks, not just by political opponents, but also by Conservative MPs. But Lord Tebbit was controversial right throughout his career. A divisive figure, he was adored by the Tory Right but loathed by the left and trade unions. But what's not disputed is that he was a massive figure in the Thatcher years."

Speaking publicly for the first time since the attack, Archie Norman declined to answer whether the business had paid a ransom. \"It's a business decision, it's a principal decision,\" he told members of the Business and Trade Committee (BTC). \"The question you have to ask is - and I think all businesses should ask - is, when they look at the demand, what are they getting for it? \"Because once your systems are compromised and you're going to have to rebuild anyway, maybe they've got exfiltrated data that you don't want to publish. Maybe there's something there, but in our case, substantially the damage had been done.\" When asked again later, Mr Norman said: \"We're not discussing any of the details of our interaction with the threat actor, including this subject, but that subject is fully shared with the NCA [National Crime Agency].\" He added: \"We don't think it's in the public interest to go into that subject on it, because it is a matter of law enforcement.\" The initial entry into M&S's systems took place on 17 April through \"sophisticated impersonation\" that involved a third party, Mr Norman said. It was two days later, on Easter Saturday, before the company became aware of the attack, and approximately a week after the intrusion before the retailer heard directly from the attacker.  A day later, after learning of the attack, the authorities were notified, while customers were told on Tuesday 22 April, MPs heard. As well as British authorities, the FBI was contacted, which is \"more muscled up in this zone\" and was \"very supportive\", Mr Norman said. By the time the breach is clear, systems have already been compromised, the chairman said. The group behind the attack may have been Scattered Spider, some of whom are believed to be English-speaking teenagers, but Mr Norman said M&S made an early decision that no one from the company would deal directly with the \"threat actor\". \"Anybody who's suffered an event like ours, it would be foolish to say there's not a thousand things you'd like to have done differently,\" he added. 'Make sure you can run business on pen and paper' In a warning to other businesses, M&S's general counsel and company secretary Nick Folland said firms should be prepared to operate without IT systems. \"One of the things that we would say to others is make sure you can run your business on pen and paper,\" he said. M&S has trebled the number of people working on cybersecurity to 80 and doubled its expenditure, the MPs heard. \"We curiously doubled our insurance cover last year,\" Mr Norman added.

        "Content": "The first hosepipe ban for this year has been declared in the UK. Yorkshire Water said restrictions will come into force across the region later this week in an effort to protect water supplies. In a report earlier this year, the Environment Agency (EA) warned England as a whole is facing huge public water shortages unless \"urgent action\" is taken. Check the latest weather forecast here It said the country faces a five billion litre a day shortfall for public water supplies by 2055 due to climate change, population growth, and environmental pressures. So what areas come under the new hosepipe ban, and how likely is it that it will be implemented elsewhere in the UK? Restrictions coming in later this week Yorkshire Water's hosepipe ban - officially called a Temporary Usage Ban (TUB) - will come into force on Friday 11th July. Put simply, it will affect any property that receives water from Yorkshire Water. The company said the ban will not apply to customers who receive wastewater services from Yorkshire Water, but clean water supply from another supplier like Severn Trent. Restrictions are due to be in place until groundwater stocks are back to where they need to be. Anyone who breaches the ban without permission from the water company could be fined as much as £1,000. Yorkshire Water director, Dave Kaye, said by putting restrictions in place, the company can apply for drought permits from the EA. The permits allow the company to start taking more water from rivers and reduce flows out of the region's reservoirs - which are 26.1% lower than they would normally be at this time of year. What does the ban mean? The ban means customers are prohibited from using hosepipes for things like watering a garden, filling a paddling pool, cleaning paths and patios or washing a car. Instead, they are being encouraged to use a watering can or bucket to do things like water plants. Businesses will be allowed to use a hosepipe if it is directly related to a commercial purpose. Yorkshire Water's Mr Kaye, said: \"People across Yorkshire will need to stop using their hosepipes to water their gardens, wash their cars or for any other activities. \"Introducing these restrictions is not a decision we have taken lightly, and we've been doing everything we can to avoid having to put them in place.\" In May, Yorkshire and the northwest of England officially entered drought after the driest spring in 132 years. From February to June, Yorkshire received just 15cm of rain, less than half what is expected in an average year. Could a ban be introduced elsewhere in the UK? The North East, East Anglia and the West Midlands are also experiencing prolonged dry weather. Earlier this year, bosses at the UK's biggest water company, Thames Water, warned of possible usage restrictions this summer to counter the dry start to the year. Thames Water chief executive Chris Weston said the company is doing \"all we need to\" to prepare for potential water shortages.  This could mean restrictions on Thames Water's 16 million customers in the southeast of England, an area that is already heavily water-stressed - where the demand for water exceeds the available supply. The last hosepipe ban, implemented by South East Water in June 2023, affected people in Kent and Sussex. The country also experienced drought and record heatwaves in 2022 when five water companies imposed a hosepipe ban on a total of 19 million customers to ensure drinking and wastewater services were prioritised. Easy ways to cut water usage While the EA is urging water companies to manage demand and reduce water leaks, it has also issued advice to the public on how to limit their water use. Its tips include: • Shortening showers• Turning off taps when brushing teeth• Using full loads for washing machines and dishwashers• Collecting rainwater for garden use• Deleting old emails to reduce pressure on data centre servers. Water UK, the trade association for the water industry, said customers can start to help leave more water in the environment by making small changes at home and in the garden. These changes can include: • Reusing water in paddling pools;• Use a scum ball in a home hot tub or spa to prevent the development of scum lines or foaming;• Using a bucket to wash cars, or only washing the windscreen and mirrors on the vehicle;• Keeping a jug of water in the fridge, so there is no need to run the tap until it turns cold."

        "Content": " Mobile phones across the UK will be sent an emergency alert as the government tests the system nationwide. During the test, the second only of its kind, approximately 87 million mobile devices will ring out unprompted. The system was first tested in April 2023, but the government said some users reported that their phones did not sound, with the problem traced back to specific networks. It has also been used on several occasions to warn of adverse weather events and in one case last year, when an unexploded Second World War bomb was due to be moved by the military. Here is what you can expect. When is it going to happen? The test is due to happen at 3pm on Sunday 7 September. Phones will vibrate and emit a loud siren sound for roughly 10 seconds, even if they are set to silent. A message will also appear on phone screens warning people it is only a test and no action needs to be taken. The government said it is testing the system to ensure it is working optimally and so the public become familiar with the alerts. The message is expected to say something similar to the following: \"This is a test of Emergency Alerts, a new UK government service that will warn you if there's a life-threatening emergency nearby. \"In a real emergency, follow the instructions in the alert to keep yourself and others safe. Visit gov.uk/alerts for more information. \"This is a test. You do not need to take any action.\" But critics have said the alerts themselves could put people's safety at risk, including drivers who may become distracted and domestic violence victims who keep a secret phone. Pat McFadden, the chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, said the test is \"really important\" but for those who are in vulnerable positions there is an option to opt out if they want to. He added: \"It'll be a really important moment where we can do the equivalent at a national level of testing the country's fire alarm or smoke alarm. [It is] part of our defences, part of our resilience, and a really important communication tool between the government and the public.\" When has the system been used for real? Since the first national test of the system in April 2023, five alerts have been sent to warn the public of real emergencies. The largest ever use of the system happened in January this year, when approximately 4.5 million people in Scotland and Northern Ireland received an alert during Storm Eowyn, after a rare red weather warning - meaning there was a risk to life - was issued. Also in January, the alert warned people of severe flooding at Proctor's Pleasure caravan park near Barrow upon Soar. The message told people in the park to evacuate to a nearby rest centre.  Another alert in December 2024 was sent to approximately 3.5 million people across Wales and the South West of England during Storm Darragh, during which two people died. The system was used for a non-weather event in February 2024. An alert was issued by Plymouth City Council to warn local residents to avoid a certain route that was being used to convoy an unexploded Second World War bomb through the city to the sea.  It told residents to stay away from the cordoned area in Keyham for a three-hour window. Tracey Lee, the chief executive of Plymouth City Council said the government's alert tool was \"invaluable\" at the time, and allowed the council to reach \"thousands of residents instantly\". How does the technology work? The emergency alerts are broadcast via mobile phone masts and work on all 4G and 5G phone networks. That's different to how the government sent out lockdown orders during the COVID-19 pandemic, when SMS messages were sent directly to phone numbers. Despite the government's pleas, domestic violence charities are concerned the alert could give away secret phones people experiencing abuse are keeping hidden. If you're concerned, it's easy to switch them off. On iOS and Android devices, search settings for \"emergency alerts\" and turn off \"severe alerts\" and \"emergency alerts\". On Huawei devices running EMUI 11 or older, search settings for \"emergency alerts\" and turn off \"extreme threats\", \"severe threats\", and \"show amber alerts\". The other option is switching off the device entirely or putting it in aeroplane mode before 3pm. It means whoever sends an alert does not need your number, so it's not something you need to reply to, nor will you receive a voicemail if you miss it. No location or other data will be collected, either. It also means alerts could be sent to tablets and smartwatches on their own data plans. Anyone in the range of a mast will receive an alert, and they can be tuned based on geography - for example, Manchester residents would not need an alert about life-threatening flooding in Cornwall. Read more:How emergency alerts work in other countries Manuel Cornelisse, Everbridge's senior director for public warnings, told Sky News the tech had proved its worth in other countries, including his homeland of the Netherlands. \"It's a very well-proven technology with very strong, quality reach,\" he said. \"And because it's part of the very highest priority of signalling, the service will always remain available, even if a network gets congested when there is massive usage (such as at a sports ground).\""

        "Content": "\n          Arts and entertainment reporter\n              @BethanyMinelle\n  Former MasterChef host Gregg Wallace has vowed he will \"not go quietly\", amid reports that he has been sacked from MasterChef. It comes after the TV host faced an investigation, commissioned by MasterChef's production company Banijay UK, into alleged inappropriate behaviour while working for the BBC. In November, the 60-year-old stepped back from presenting the cooking show after accusations that he made sexual comments towards staff and celebrity guests on a range of programmes over 17 years. Broadcaster Kirsty Wark, author and actor Emma Kennedy, and presenter Kirstie Allsopp, were among the high-profile figures who made claims of inappropriate behaviour against Wallace. In a statement, released ahead of the publication of the summary of a report into the claims, the 60-year-old said he had been \"cleared of the most serious and sensational accusations\" made against him. However, he said the report, carried out by independent law firm Lewis Silkin, had found him \"primarily guilty of inappropriate language between 2005 and 2018\". Wallace's statement, published on Instagram, came hours before the BBC News reported that 50 more people had made claims to the corporation against the presenter, including allegations he groped one MasterChef worker and pulled his trousers down in front of another. In his statement, Wallace labelled BBC News's claims as \"uncorroborated tittle-tattle\". Wallace wrote: \"I have taken the decision to speak out ahead of the publication of the Silkin's report - a decision I do not take lightly. \"But after 21 years of loyal service to the BBC, I cannot sit in silence while my reputation is further damaged to protect others. \"I have now been cleared by the Silkin's report of the most serious and sensational accusations made against me. \"The most damaging claims (including from public figures which have not been upheld) were found to be baseless after a full and forensic six-month investigation. \"To be clear, the Silkin's report exonerates me of all the serious allegations which made headlines last year and finds me primarily guilty of inappropriate language between 2005 and 2018.\" 'I was hired as the cheeky greengrocer - now that's a problem' Wallace said he recognised that \"some of my humour and language\" was at times \"inappropriate\" and, for that, he apologised \"without reservation\". \"But I was never the caricature now being sold for clicks,\" Wallace, who also referred to his recent diagnosis of autism, added. \"I was hired by the BBC and MasterChef as the cheeky greengrocer. A real person with warmth, character, rough edges, and all. \"For over two decades, that authenticity was part of the brand. Now, in a sanitised world, that same personality is seen as a problem.\" Wallace: Complaints from 'middle-class women of a certain age' Shortly after the allegations first emerged, Wallace recorded a video where he dismissed his accusers as \"middle-class women of a certain age\". His remarks were met with huge criticism - including from Downing Street, where a spokesperson for the prime minister described them as \"completely inappropriate and misogynistic\". Wallace responded by posting a follow-up clip where he apologised and said he \"wasn't in a good space\" when he posted the comments. Wallace was replaced in the 20th season of MasterChef, which aired this spring, by restaurant critic and former I'm A Celebrity contestant Grace Dent. Several Christmas episodes of the show were also pulled from the BBC's 2024 festive schedule. In April, Wallace spoke to the Daily Mail, denying all accusations against him and saying he had contemplated suicide following the allegations. Wallace's lawyers have previously called allegations that he engages in behaviour of a sexually harassing nature \"entirely false\". A spokesperson for the BBC said: \"Banijay UK instructed the law firm Lewis Silkin to run an investigation into allegations against Gregg Wallace. We are not going to comment until the investigation is complete and the findings are published.\" A Banijay spokesperson told Sky News: \"We won't be commenting until our report is published.\" They have signalled the report will be published later this week or next. Banijay previously said Wallace was \"committed to fully co-operating\" with the external review. Read more from Sky News:Problems emerging at 'Alligator Alcatraz'First malaria treatment for babies approvedThree men guilty of arson attack ordered by Wagner Group Alongside MasterChef, Wallace presented Inside The Factory for BBC Two from 2015 to 2023. He also featured on various BBC shows over the years, including Saturday Kitchen, Eat Well For Less, Supermarket Secrets, Celebrity MasterChef and MasterChef: The Professionals, as well as being a Strictly Come Dancing contestant in 2014. More recently, Wallace has been promoting his health and lifestyle website, offering one-to-one coaching from both himself and a team of experts, which includes nutritionists and doctors, and his wife Anna in the role of recipe curator.

        "Content": "\n          Arts and entertainment reporter\n              @BethanyMinelle\n Raynor Winn, the author of the best-selling memoir The Salt Path, has called claims she \"lied\" in her 2018 book \"highly misleading\". Winn has previously said the book is based on notes from a journey she and her husband Moth took along the South West Coast Path - familiarly known as The Salt Path - after losing their family farm and receiving a terminal health diagnosis. The book records that following Moth's medical diagnosis of the rare neurological condition Corticobasal Degeneration (CBD), the couple embarked on the arduous 630-mile trek along the Cornish, Devon, and Dorset coast with just a tent and two rucksacks. However, a report in The Observer disputes some of the key facts in the memoir. Speaking to Sky News, Raynor Winn called The Observer article \"highly misleading\", and said that the couple were taking legal advice and so wouldn't be making any further comment. Her statement went on: \"The Salt Path lays bare the physical and spiritual journey Moth and I shared, an experience that transformed us completely and altered the course of our lives. This is the true story of our journey.\" PSPA, a charity that supports people with CBD and Progressive Supranuclear Palsy (PSP), says they have \"terminated\" their relationship with the family following the publication of The Observer article. They told their supporters \"Many questions currently remain unanswered\". Raynor Winn had been scheduled to make numerous appearances over the summer, performing with Saltlines, her collaboration with Gigspanner Big Band. However, the band has since announced on social media that she will no longer be taking part in the tour. Raynor Winn is also scheduled to take part in various Q&As, conversations, writing courses and festivals over the summer. The Salt Path sold over a million copies worldwide and spent nearly two years on The Sunday Times bestseller list. It is billed by its publisher Penguin as an \"unflinchingly honest, inspiring and life-affirming true story\". It is the first of a quartet of novels by Raynor Winn all based around a love of nature, walking and the triumph of determination over adversity. The fourth book is due out in October. The book was made into a film starring Gillian Anderson and Jason Isaacs, shot across Somerset, Devon, Cornwall and Wales in 2023, and released earlier this year. Speaking to Sky News in April, Isaacs said he had spoken to Raynor and Moth just the night before, describing them as \"humble\" and not \"wanting attention paid to them\". The actor described the movie as \"a true, beautiful, real-life love story, and a mystical, miraculous story about nature as well,\" and also said he hoped it would encourage people to \"look at homeless people when they walk by in a different light\". Number 9 Films and Shadowplay Features told Sky News the film was a \"faithful adaptation\" of the book they optioned. They said in a statement: \"The allegations made in The Observer relate to the book and are a matter for the author Raynor Winn. We have passed any correspondence relating to the article to Raynor and her agent. \"When we were recently made aware that The Observer was planning to publish, we advised our key collaborators, filmmakers and stakeholders. There were no known claims against the book at the time of optioning it or producing and distributing the film and we undertook all necessary due diligence before acquiring the book. \"The journalist contacting us about the story at the end of last week was the first time we were made aware of the allegations.\" Sky News has contacted Penguin, the publishers of The Salt Path, and two of Raynor Winn's subsequent books, for comment."
