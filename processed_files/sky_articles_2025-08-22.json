        "Headline": "Over half a million people are facing \"catastrophic conditions\", according to a report from the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC). The confirmation of famine in Gaza City is the IPC's first outside of Africa, and fifth since 2004.",
        "Content": " A famine has been declared in Gaza City and the surrounding neighbourhoods. The Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) - a globally recognised system for classifying the severity of food insecurity and malnutrition - has confirmed just four famines since it was established in 2004. These were in Somalia in 2011, and in Sudan in 2017, 2020, and 2024. The confirmation of famine in Gaza City is the IPC's first outside of Africa. \"After 22 months of relentless conflict, over half a million people in the Gaza Strip are facing catastrophic conditions characterised by starvation, destitution and death,\" the report said, adding that more than a million other people face a severe level of food insecurity. Over the next month, conditions are also expected to worsen, with the famine projected to expand to Deir al-Balah and Khan Younis, the report said. Nearly a third of the population (641,000 people) are expected to face catastrophic conditions, while acute malnutrition is projected to continue getting worse rapidly. \n                  Israel is accused of allowing famine to fester in Gaza and global condemnation is deafening\n                 \n                  Israel to continue with Gaza City offensive despite talks to free Hamas hostages\n                 \n                  What's it like with the National Guard on the streets of DC?\n                 The IPC defines famine as a situation in which at least one in five households has an extreme lack of food and face starvation and destitution, resulting in extremely critical levels of acute malnutrition and death. Famine is when an area has: • More than 20% of households facing extreme food shortages • More than 30% of children suffering from acute malnutrition • A daily mortality rate that exceeds two per 10,000 people, or four per 10,000 children under five The report said at least 132,000 children will suffer from acute malnutrition over the next year - double the organisation's estimates from May 2024. The IPC said the situation could be even worse further north in Gaza, but limited data prevented any precise classification. Israel says no famine in Gaza Volker Turk, the UN Human Rights chief, said the famine is the direct result of actions taken by the Israeli government. \"It is a war crime to use starvation as a method of warfare, and the resulting deaths may also amount to the war crime of wilful killing,\" he said. COGAT, the Israeli military agency that coordinates aid, has rejected the findings. Israel's foreign ministry said there is no famine in Gaza: \"Over 100,000 trucks of aid have entered Gaza since the start of the war, and in recent weeks a massive influx of aid has flooded the Strip with staple foods and caused a sharp decline in food prices, which have plummeted in the markets.\" Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the report was an \"outright lie\", adding that Israel \"does not have a policy of starvation\". \"Israel has a policy of preventing starvation. Since the beginning of the war Israel has enabled 2 million tons of aid to enter the Gaza Strip, over one ton of aid per person,\" he said in a statement. Ceasefire pleas to stop famine British Foreign Secretary David Lammy called the IPC report \"utterly horrifying and wholly preventable\", and demanded that Israel immediately allow unhindered supplies of food, medicines and fuel into Gaza. \"We desperately need an immediate ceasefire, to enable aid delivery at maximum speed and at the scale required. This includes halting the military operation in Gaza City which is the epicentre of the famine,\" Mr Lammy said in a statement. Europe correspondent Tom Fletcher, speaking on behalf of the United Nations, did not mince his words. Gaza was suffering from famine, the evidence was irrefutable and Israel had not just obstructed aid but had also used hunger as a weapon of war. His anger seeped through every sentence, just as desperation is laced through the report from the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC). Conditions are expected to worsen, it says, even though the Gaza Strip has been classified as a level 5 famine. There is no level 6. But it took only moments for the Israeli government to respond in terms that were just as strident. Read Adam Parsons' analysis here. Tom Fletcher, UN under-secretary general for humanitarian affairs, echoed Mr Lammy's comments as he made a desperate plea to Mr Netanyahu to declare a ceasefire in the wake of the famine announcement. \"My ask, my plea, my demand to Prime Minister Netanyahu and anyone who can reach him. Enough. Ceasefire. Open the crossings, north and south, all of them,\" he said. Read more from Sky News:Trump critic has home raided by the FBIMultiple people killed in tour bus crash UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said the Gaza famine was a \"man-made disaster, a moral indictment, and a failure of humanity itself\". The IPC had previously warned famine was imminent in parts of Gaza, but had stopped short of a formal declaration. The latest report on Gaza from the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) says there were almost 13,000 new admissions of children for acute malnutrition recorded in July. The latest numbers from the Gaza health ministry are 251 dead as a result of famine and malnutrition, including 108 children. But Israel has previously accused Hamas of inflating these figures, saying that most of the children who died had pre-existing health conditions."

        "Content": " The US Justice Department has released a transcript of an interview with Ghislaine Maxwell - the jailed ex-girlfriend of paedophile financier Jeffrey Epstein. Maxwell said in the interview with Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche last month that she never saw US President Donald Trump in an \"inappropriate setting\". According to the transcript, Maxwell said: \"I never witnessed the president in any inappropriate setting in any way. The president was never inappropriate with anybody.\" Maxwell also recalled knowing about Mr Trump and possibly meeting him for the first time in 1990, when her newspaper magnate father, Robert Maxwell, was the owner of the New York Daily News. \"I may have met Donald Trump at that time, because my father was friendly with him and liked him very much,\" Maxwell said, according to the transcript. Maxwell said her father was fond of Mr Trump's then-wife, Ivana, \"because she was also from Czechoslovakia, where my dad was from\". She was sentenced in the US in June 2022 to 20 years in prison following her conviction on five counts of sex trafficking for luring young girls to massage rooms for Epstein to abuse. She has asked the US Supreme Court to overturn her conviction. Epstein, 66, was found dead in his cell at a Manhattan federal jail in August 2019 as he awaited trial on sex trafficking charges. His death was ruled a suicide. Trump 'was always very cordial' His case has generated endless attention and conspiracy theories due to his and Maxwell's links to famous people like royals, presidents and billionaires, including Mr Trump. No one other than Epstein and Maxwell has been charged with crimes. Mr Trump knew Epstein socially in the 1990s and early 2000s. During Maxwell's trial in 2021, Epstein's longtime pilot, Lawrence Visoski, said Mr Trump flew on Epstein's private plane several times. Mr Trump has denied flying on the plane. Maxwell, 63, said in her interview with the Justice Department that she never saw Mr Trump receive a massage. She told Mr Blanche that Mr Trump \"was always very cordial and very kind to me\", adding: \"And I just want to say that I admire his extraordinary achievement in becoming the president now.\" Read more: All we know about Donald Trump and Jeffrey Epstein's 'friendship' Maxwell denies introducing Epstein to Prince Andrew Maxwell also denied in the interview that she had ever introduced Prince Andrew to Epstein, and that the Duke of York could not have had sex at her house with Virginia Giuffre. Ms Giuffre, who died in April, sued the Duke of York for sexual abuse in August 2021, saying Andrew had sex with her when she was 17 and had been trafficked by Epstein. The duke has repeatedly denied the claims, and he has not been charged with any criminal offences. In March 2022, it was announced Ms Giuffre and Andrew had reached an out-of-court settlement - believed to include a \"substantial donation to Ms Giuffre's charity in support of victims' rights\".  Maxwell told the Justice Department: \"I did not introduce [Epstein] to Prince Andrew or to Sarah Ferguson. That is a flat untruth. I'll start with that.\" She insisted Epstein and the duke met separately, and said \"I think Sarah [Ferguson] is the one that pushed that\", before saying that allegations Andrew had sex with Ms Giuffre were untrue, as she was at her mother's 80th birthday celebrations in the countryside outside the city. She then claimed Ms Giuffre's allegation that she and Andrew had sexual contact in the bathroom of Maxwell's London flat was not true, as the room was not big enough. She also claimed that an image of her standing alongside Andrew with his arm around Ms Giuffre's waist was \"literally a fake photo\". The release of the transcript comes after Mr Trump has faced criticism from Republican supporters and Democrats over his Justice Department's decision not to release further details relating to Epstein, after the now US president promised to do so during the election. Read more: What you need to know about Trump, Epstein and the MAGA controversy  The Justice Department previously said a review of the Epstein case had found \"no incriminating 'client list'\" and \"no credible evidence\" the jailed financier had blackmailed famous men. In the transcript of the department's interview with Maxwell, Epstein’s former girlfriend said that she is not aware of any Epstein 'client list'. After her interview in July, Maxwell was moved to a minimum-security prison camp in Bryan, Texas, by the federal Bureau of Prisons (BOP) after she was held at a low-security prison in Tallahassee, Florida, that housed men and women. The Texas camp houses solely female prisoners, the majority of whom are serving time for non-violent offences and white-collar crimes. Neither Maxwell's lawyer nor the BOP gave a reason for the move. Maxwell's legal team have maintained that she was wrongly prosecuted and denied a fair trial, and have floated the idea of a pardon from Mr Trump. Read more from Sky News:Tour bus crash kills and injures several peopleTrump critic has home raided by the FBI The president said earlier this month that \"nobody\" had asked him about pardoning Maxwell, but insisted that he has \"the right to do it\". Mr Trump said: \"I'm allowed to do it, but nobody's asked me to do it. I know nothing about it. I don't know anything about the case, but I know I have the right to do it. \"I have the right to give pardons, I've given pardons to people before, but nobody's even asked me to do it.\""

        "Content": " The government has taken the first step in appealing a court's decision that asylum seekers cannot be housed in an Essex hotel. The Home Office is seeking permission to intervene in the case, which, if granted, will allow it to appeal the interim judgment handed down last week. Epping Forest District Council sought an interim High Court injunction to stop migrants from being accommodated at The Bell Hotel in Epping, which is owned by Somani Hotels Limited.  The interim injunction demanded the hotel be cleared of its occupants within 14 days. In a ruling on Tuesday, Mr Justice Eyre granted the temporary block, but extended the time limit by which it must stop housing asylum seekers to 12 September. Somani Hotels will now appeal against the court order blocking the use of the hotel as accommodation for asylum seekers, the company's solicitors have said. Meanwhile, security minister Dan Jarvis said on Friday that closing hotels housing asylum seekers must be done \"in a managed and ordered way\" as he unveiled government plans to challenge the High Court's decision. \n                  Labour may have walked into political trap over housing asylum seekers in hotels\n                 \n                  18 councils pursuing or considering legal action to block asylum hotels\n                 \n                  The latest migration stats are going in the wrong direction - and the argument might get more vicious\n                 He told broadcasters: \"This government will close all asylum hotels and we will clear up the mess that we inherited from the previous government. \"We've made a commitment that we will close all of the asylum hotels by the end of this parliament, but we need to do that in a managed and ordered way. \"And that's why we'll appeal this decision.\" An analysis by Sky News has found 18 other councils are also actively pursuing or considering similar legal challenges to block asylum hotels - including Labour-run Tamworth and Wirral. Disquiet with the use of asylum hotels is at a high after the latest statistics showed there were more than 32,000 asylum seekers currently staying in hotels, marking a rise of 8% during Labour's first year in office. The number of small boat crossings in the Channel is also up 38% on the previous 12 months.  Following the Epping case, a wave of protests is expected outside of asylum hotels across the country in the coming days. Stand Up To Racism is preparing to hold counter-protests outside the asylum hotels on Friday, including in Bournemouth, Cardiff and Leeds, with further demonstrations expected on Saturday.  In its case, Epping Forest District Council argued that the owners of the Bell Hotel did not have planning permission to use the premises to accommodate asylum seekers. It argued that the injunction was needed amid \"unprecedented levels of protest and disruption\" in connection with the accommodation. Shadow justice secretary Robert Jenrick said the people of Epping who protested and its council have \"led the way\", writing in The Telegraph that \"our country's patience has snapped\". His Conservative colleague Chris Philp, the shadow home secretary, said on Thursday that people have \"every right\" to protest over asylum hotels in their areas. Kemi Badenoch, the Tory leader, has urged councils to explore legal challenges - with Conservative-run Broxbourne Council announcing that it would do so. Read more:A council-by-council breakdown of asylum seekers in hotelsWho says what on asylum hotels?Labour smell dirty tricks over asylum hotel court ruling Hillingdon Council, which is also controlled by the Tories, also said it was exploring its options. Meanwhile, former Reform chairman Zia Yusuf told Sky News three councils run by his party had the power to mount legal challenges. He said West Northamptonshire, which Reform seized control of in May's local elections, would be doing so. In a further headache for Sir Keir Starmer, Labour-controlled councils are also considering legal action, including Wirral and Tamworth. Paula Basnett, the Labour leader of Wirral council, said: \"We are actively considering all options available to us to ensure that any use of hotels or other premises in Wirral is lawful and does not ride roughshod over planning regulations or the wishes of our communities.\" Carol Dean, the Labour leader of Tamworth Borough Council, said she understood the \"strong feelings\" of residents about the use of a local hotel to house asylum seekers, and added: \"We are closely monitoring developments and reviewing our legal position\". Labour-controlled Stevenage council added: \"The council takes breaches of planning control seriously and we're actively investigating alleged breaches relating to the operation of hotels in Stevenage.\""

        "Content": "\n          Political correspondent\n              @robpowellnews\n  Has the government just walked into a giant political elephant trap by attempting to reverse the Epping hotel ruling? Already on the back foot after a judge ordered the Bell Hotel to be emptied of asylum seekers, the Home Office is now being attacked for trying to appeal that decision. \"The government isn't listening to the public or to the courts,\" said Tory shadow home secretary Chris Philp. The politics is certainly difficult. Government sources are alive to that fact, even accusing the Tory-led Epping Council of \"playing politics\" by launching the legal challenge in the first place. The fact Labour councils are now also considering claims undermines that somewhat. After all, the party did promise to shut every asylum hotel by the next election. \n                  Government takes first step in appealing court ruling banning asylum seekers from Epping hotel\n                 \n                  18 councils pursuing or considering legal action to block asylum hotels\n                 \n                  The latest migration stats are going in the wrong direction - and the argument might get more vicious\n                 Figures out this week showed an increase in the number of migrants in hotels since the Tories left office. And now, an attempt to keep people in a hotel that's become a flashpoint for anger. That's why ministers are trying to emphasise that closing the Bell Hotel is a matter of when, not if.  \"We've made a commitment that we will close all of the asylum hotels by the end of this parliament, but we need to do that in a managed and ordered way\", said the security minister Dan Jarvis. The immediate problem for the Home Office is the same one that caused hotels to be used in the first place. There are vanishingly few accommodation options.  Labour has moved away from using old military sites. That's despite one RAF base in Essex - which Sir Keir Starmer had promised to close - seeing an increase in the number of migrants being housed. Back in June, the immigration minister told MPs that medium-sized sites like disused tower blocks, old teacher training colleges or redundant student accommodation could all be used. Until 2023, regular residential accommodation was relied on. Read more from Sky News:Rise in migrants staying in hotelsTown 'changed' by immigrationExplainer: Where can migrants stay? But getting hold of more flats and houses could be practically and politically difficult, given shortages of homes and long council waiting lists. All of this is why previous legal challenges made by councils have ultimately failed. The government has a legal duty to house asylum seekers at risk of destitution, so judges have tended to decide that blocking off the hotel option runs the risk of causing ministers to act unlawfully. So to return to the previous question. Yes, the government may well have walked into a political trap here. But it probably had no choice."

The bus, with 52 passengers on board, crashed and rolled on Interstate 90 near Pembroke, about 30 miles (48km) east of Buffalo, in New York State, at around 12.30pm (5.30pm UK time). \"At this time we have multiple fatalities, multiple entrapments and multiple injuries,\" said Trooper James O'Callaghan, a spokesperson for the New York State Police. Some children were on board. Several people inside were thrown from the bus as the windows shattered, while some passengers became trapped in the wreckage. Erie County Medical Centre (ECMC) in Buffalo said it had received 24 patients. At a news conference, Dr Jennifer Pugh, chief of emergency medicine at ECMC, said two people had been taken to the operating theatre, one of whom had suffered internal injuries. Dr Jeffrey Brewer, chief of surgery, said he expected that two patients who had suffered the most serious injuries would recover. He added that people had been admitted with blunt trauma, head injuries and extremity (arm and leg) fractures. Millard Fillmore Suburban Hospital received another 11 patients, Buffalo General received four, while Oishei Children's Hospital took in three children. Mr O'Callahan said most people on the bus were Indian, Chinese, and Filipino, and translators were being brought to the scene. The driver survived and is cooperating with the police. He added: \"It's a full-size tour bus. Heavy amount of damage.

        "Content": "\n          Culture and entertainment reporter\n              @gemmapeplow\n  Actor Noel Clarke has lost his High Court libel case against the publisher of The Guardian, over a series of news articles which featured claims from a number of women. The first article, published in April 2021, said some 20 women who knew Clarke in a professional capacity had come forward with allegations of sexual misconduct. The 49-year-old actor, writer and director, best known for his 2006 film Kidulthood and starring in Doctor Who, sued the publisher and vehemently denied \"any sexual misconduct or wrongdoing\" - but the court has found Guardian News and Media (GNM) successfully defended the legal action on the grounds of truth and public interest. Read more:The key allegations against Noel Clarke - and the judge's response The meanings of all eight of the newspaper's publications were found to be \"substantially true\", the judge, Mrs Justice Steyn, said in a summary of the findings. \"I have accepted some of Mr Clarke's evidence... but overall I find that he was not a credible or reliable witness,\" she said. In her ruling, the judge also said suggestions that more than 20 witnesses, \"none of whom are parties or have a stake in this case, as [Clarke] does\" had come to court to lie was \"inherently implausible\". From the evidence heard, it was \"clear that women have been speaking about their experiences of working with Mr Clarke for many years\", she said. 'A deserved victory for women who suffered' Lucy Osborne and Sirin Kale, the journalists who carried out the investigation, told Sky News they had always been confident in everything published. \"I think that this is not a problem that's going to go away,\" said Osborne. \"This kind of behaviour very much still happens in the TV and film industry and other industries. So I do hope this judgment gives other women the confidence to speak out about what they've experienced.\" Read more: The key allegations - and judge's response Guardian editor-in-chief Katharine Viner described the ruling as \"a deserved victory for those women who suffered because of the behaviour of Noel Clarke\". She continued: \"Going to court is difficult and stressful, yet more than 20 women agreed to testify in the High Court, refusing to be bullied or intimidated. \"This is also a landmark judgment for Guardian journalism, and for investigative journalism in Britain... The judgment is clear that our investigation was thorough and fair, a template for public interest journalism.\" Clarke's response Clarke described the result as disappointing and maintained he believes the newspaper's reporting was \"inaccurate and damaging\". \"I have never claimed to be perfect,\" he said. \"But I am not the person described in these articles. Overnight I lost everything.\" He said he wanted to thank witnesses who supported his case, as well as his family, \"who never stopped believing there was something worth fighting for\". Arts and entertainment correspondent Noel Clarke isn't the first man working within the entertainment industry to fail to grasp that with power comes responsibility, and sadly I suspect he won’t be the last. As he licked his wounds following the judge's verdict, the foot-stamping also continued. \"I have never claimed to be perfect... but I am not the person described in these articles,\" he insisted. The judge disagreed. There is no workplace where unwanted kissing should be acceptable. For some reason, in TV and film the attitude that different rules apply has permeated for decades. Spoiler alert: they don't. It's inexcusable that anyone in a professional environment could be belittled or subjected to unwanted sexual advances or comments. The Guardian's win is a significant judgment for investigative journalism and the role a free press plays in bringing serious allegations into the public domain. And once again, while we all look at the one man, you also have to think about those who surrounded him who enjoyed the ride. Those who didn't challenge him. Those who were happy to piggy-back off of his popularity, who didn't pull him up. His ego, that sense of invincibility, wasn't an overnight thing. On shoots, his behaviour had clearly become normalised – somebody could, and should, have called it out. What happened during the trial? The trial took place from early March to early April 2025, hearing evidence from multiple witnesses who made accusations against Clarke, including that he had allegedly shared nude photographs of them without their consent, groped them, and asked them to look at him when he was exposed. Clarke also gave evidence over several days. At one stage, the actor appeared visibly emotional as he claimed the publisher had \"smashed my life\" with its investigation. His lawyer told the court he had been made a \"scapegoat\" and was an \"easy target\", as a star at the height of his success when the media industry \"zealously sought to correct itself\" following the #MeToo movement. The actor had been handed the outstanding British contribution to cinema award at the BAFTAs just a few weeks before the report was published. Following the article, BAFTA announced it had suspended his membership. But lawyers for The Guardian told how newspaper's investigation was \"careful and thorough\", saying it had been carried out \"conscientiously\" by the journalists involved. In March 2022, police said the actor would not face a criminal investigation over the allegations."

        "Content": "By Simone Baglivo, Europe producer  The Ukrainian suspected of coordinating attacks on the Nord Stream pipelines had served in Ukraine's Secret Service and in the Ukrainian Army's special forces, Sky News understand.  Serhii K., 49, was arrested in northern Italy on Thursday following the issuance of a European arrest warrant by German prosecutors. It is not known whether he was still serving at the time of the pipeline attack in 2022 and Ukraine's government has always denied any involvement in the explosions. According to sources close to the case, the suspect has been found in a three-star bungalow hotel named La Pescaccia in San Clemente, in the province of Rimini.  When military officers from Italy's Carabinieri investigative and operational units raided his bedroom, he didn't try to resist the arrest. The hotel's employees have been questioned, but no further evidence or any weapons were found, the sources added. Serhii arrived on Italy's Adriatic coast earlier this week, and the purpose of his trip was a holiday. He was found with his two children and his wife. \n                   Italy arrests Ukrainian over Nord Stream attacks, German prosecutors say\n                 \n                  Oasis fan dies in hotel room hours before show in Edinburgh\n                 \n                  Thousands evacuated as deadly wildfires sweep Europe\n                 At least one of the four people within his family had a travel ticket issued in Poland. He crossed the Italian border with his car with a Ukrainian license plate last Tuesday. He was travelling with his passport, and he used his real identity to check into the hotel, triggering an emergency alert on a police server, we have been told. After the arrest, he was taken to the Rimini police station before being moved to a prison in Bologna, the regional capital, on Friday. Deputy Bologna Prosecutor Licia Scagliarini has granted the German judicial authorities' requests for Serhii's surrender, but Sky News understands the man told the appeal court that he doesn't consent to being handed over to Germany. He also denied the charges and said he was in Ukraine during the Nord Stream sabotage. He added that he is currently in Italy for family reasons. While leaving the court, he was seen making a typical Ukrainian nationalist 'trident' gesture to the reporters. The next hearing is scheduled for 3 September, when the Bologna appeal court is set to decide whether Serhii will be extradited to Germany or not. He will remain in jail until then. In Germany, he will face charges of collusion to cause an explosion, anti-constitutional sabotage and the destruction of structures. German prosecutors believe he was part of a group of people who planted devices on the pipelines near the Danish island of Bornholm in September 2022. Serhii and his accomplices are believed to have set off from Rostock on Germany's north-eastern coast in a sailing yacht to carry out the attack.

It represented a significant escalation in the Ukraine conflict and worsening of the continent's energy supply crisis. According to a US intelligence report leaked in 2023, a pro-Ukraine group was behind the attack. Yet, no group has ever claimed responsibility. Sky News understands Genoa's Prosecutor's Office in northern Italy has requested their colleagues in Bologna to share the information related to Serhii. Anti-terrorism prosecutors are investigating another alleged sabotage linked to the Russian shadow fleet oil tanker Seajewel, which sank off the port of Savona last February. On Thursday, they asked an investigative police unit to figure out whether there is a link between that episode and the Nord Stream attacks."

        "Content": " The FBI has raided the home of John Bolton, the former national security adviser to Donald Trump who has since become a staunch critic of the US president. The search of Mr Bolton's house in Bethesda, Maryland, on Friday was part of a \"national security investigation in search of classified records\", reported NBC News, Sky's US partner network, citing a source. Mr Bolton has not been detained or apprehended. He served as Mr Trump's top security adviser for 17 months during his first term in office, but was forced out of the role in 2019. Mr Trump on Friday told reporters in Washington that he'd had no advance knowledge of the raid, adding: \"I'm not a fan of John Bolton.\" The US Justice Department is yet to comment, but FBI director Kash Patel posted on X on Friday morning, writing: \"NO ONE is above the law… @FBI agents on mission.\" An FBI official said in a statement that the agency was \"conducting court-authorised activity in the area\", indicating grounds had been approved for a search warrant. Mr Trump's former adviser is yet to respond to enquiries for comment. He was not at his home during the early morning raid, CNN reported. He was seen in his Washington DC office on Friday in talks with FBI officials, according to the Associated Press. US federal authorities are yet to release any details as to why the search has been conducted and what allegations may be levelled against Mr Bolton. CIA Director John Ratcliffe provided the intelligence to Mr Patel that served as the basis for the search warrant for Mr Bolton's home and office, a source told Sky News' US partner network. Unnamed sources reportedly told the New York Times that an investigation has been launched into whether Mr Bolton illegally shared or possessed classified information. NBC's source said the probe was looking into potential instances of the documents being leaked to journalists. During his time as adviser, Mr Bolton had clashed regularly with the president on policy direction over Iran and North Korea. He was viewed as a hawkish adviser, and Mr Trump has previously criticised him as \"warmongering\", saying he pushed him to take military action on Iran. Since leaving the post, Mr Bolton has called the Republican president unfit to serve, and most recently criticised Trump's actions in Ukraine and negotiations with Russian President Vladimir Putin. In 2020, Mr Bolton also published a memoir of his time in the White House, in which he described multiple instances of what he described as Mr Trump's misconduct and incompetence in handling foreign policy. 👉 Follow Trump100 on your podcast app 👈  He also alleged that the president often prioritised his own personal interests over national security. Prior to publication, Mr Trump's government had tried to block the release but failed in its legal bid. Since his return to office, Mr Trump has on multiple occasions sought to use his presidential powers against perceived political enemies. On his first day back in the White House, he revoked the security clearances of more than four dozen intelligence officials, including Mr Bolton. He also cancelled security detail for Mr Bolton and two other former Trump officials earlier this year. The officials had been receiving federal protection because of threats to their safety from Iran. Prior to working for Mr Trump during his first-term team, Mr Bolton had served in George W. Bush's administration as the US ambassador to the United Nations."

        "Content": "A Northampton childminder who was jailed for inciting racial hatred after the Southport murders has said she is considering legal action against the police. Lucy Connolly was released from HMP Peterborough on Thursday, nine months into her 31-month sentence, after she pleaded guilty to inciting racial hatred by publishing and distributing \"threatening or abusive\" written material on X. The 42-year-old posted in an apparent reference to asylum seekers staying in UK hotels on 29 July - the day three girls were killed in Southport - last year: \"Mass deportation now, set fire to all the f****** hotels full of the bastards for all I care... if that makes me racist so be it.\" The mother-of-three, whose husband is a Conservative councillor, had shared the post after false rumours circulated online that the Southport murderer was an asylum seeker. He was later named as UK-born teenager Axel Rudakubana.  Connolly's post was viewed 310,000 times in three-and-a-half hours before she deleted it. Shortly after her release from prison, Connolly accused officials of issuing \"false information\" over her police interview. She told The Telegraph and Dan Wootton's show on YouTube that she was considering legal action over a statement which suggested she told officers in her police interview that she did not like immigrants. \"I do believe that they, you know, issued false information. I do think that they crossed the line and they didn't do things they should and I will be taking that up with them,\" she told Wootton. \"How far I take that, I don't know at this point, but it is definitely something I'll be taking up with them.\" She told The Telegraph that police were \"dishonest\" and her words were \"massively twisted and used against me\" in a statement released by the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS). A press release from the CPS after her guilty plea on 2 September included a quote from Frank Ferguson, head of the CPS Special Crime and Counter Terrorism Unit, which said: \"During police interview Lucy Connolly stated she had strong views on immigration, told officers she did not like immigrants and claimed that children were not safe from them.\" Connolly said she will release the content of the police interview so people can see what the police and the CPS said are \"two very different things to what I said in my interview\". She added: \"I made it quite clear to them that I know the difference between immigration and illegal immigration. But I feel that that was massively twisted and used against me.\" The CPS declined to comment any further when approached, but pointed Sky News to their updated release, where the word \"illegal\" appeared to have been added to the original statement. A Northamptonshire Police spokesperson said: \"We are aware of comments made by Lucy Connolly in an interview following her release from prison. \"We hope to contact Mrs Connolly in the coming days to understand the issues she has raised around Northamptonshire Police.\" Read more from Sky News:Govt wants to appeal asylum seeker hotel rulingHow many asylum seekers are housed in your area? Speaking with Wootton, the host claimed Connolly would meet representatives of the Trump administration on Saturday. Asked about that meeting, Connolly said: \"Not much, just that they're very interested in the way things are going in the UK, and they are obviously big advocates for free speech, and their lawyers are keen to speak with me.\" She also told Wootton: \"I should never have said what I said. It was wrong. \"But I am no far-right activist. I'm no far-right thug.\" At Connolly's sentencing at Birmingham Crown Court in October, Judge Melbourne Inman KC said: \"Some people used that tragedy as an opportunity to sow division and hatred, often using social media, leading to a number of towns and cities being disfigured.\" He added: \"When you published those words, you were well aware how volatile the situation was. That volatility led to serious disorder where mindless violence was used.\""

        "Content": "\n          News correspondent\n              @ashnahurynag\n  Over a million people are descending on west London this week for an event like no other. Colourful, celebratory and culturally significant, but it has become increasingly contentious. For the family of Cher Maximen it's an event they can no longer be excited about. In their eyes, carnival has been tainted by the memories of last year when 32-year-old Cher was killed in front of her young daughter in an unexpected, unprovoked attack in the middle of carnival's 'family day'. Cher's family say she would not want the event to stop, but that its \"current format\" is unsafe. \"Where some people say, wrong place, wrong time. She was in the right place, at the right time, where she should have been, and still she wasn't safe,\" says Lawrence Hoo, Cher's cousin. Mr Hoo says the event is not set up to protect carnival-goers: \"She was in the safest location possible on family day with her daughter and she was murdered directly in front of police officers, so if it can happen there, it can happen anywhere, in all honesty, it's an unmanageable event.\" \n                  100 arrests ahead of Notting Hill Carnival in 'intelligence-led interventions', Met Police say\n                 \n                  Man charged with murder after fatal stabbing of ice cream seller in Wembley\n                 \n                  'Ice cream seller stabbed eight times' as police arrest two in Wembley\n                 Last year, the number of carnival-related crimes were down on the year before, and the majority were related to drug offences. Cher was one of two people murdered at last year's event. Mr Hoo says the threat of violence hasn't gone away: \"Really, one murder is a murder too many. I believe that has become too dangerous. \"Could it happen again? Of course it could happen again. Of course, it could happen again. You could turn up the day before, you could be there, you can step out of the front door, you're in the site. I think it's an unmanageable location.\" Cher's grandmother, Vyleen Maximen, wants the international three-day event to be moved. \"When I had the meeting with them, I said 'why can't you move it to a different place? ie Hyde Park - that's a big enough park'. I was told 'well, it wouldn't be called Notting Hill Carnival'.\" For the family it comes down to concerns around who attends the street parade. The perceived lack of screening for individuals with weapons worries them. \"This is why I would like it moved,\" Ms Maximen said. \"I mean, it's not up to me. This is just my personal opinion. Have it structured, this is the way in, then the way out, but on the streets you can do whatever and just escape through the streets.\" This weekend, carnival organisers say 7,000 officers and staff will be on site each day with live facial recognition cameras and screening arches used at the busiest entry points. The option of moving the event however is not up for discussion, says Matthew Phillip, Notting Hill Carnival's chief executive. \"Carnival should remain on the streets of Notting Hill. It's where it started, it's a community event. Unfortunately, it has been marred by incidents. \"Our hearts are very much with the family, but carnival should remain on in the streets of Notting Hill. What we need to do is actually tackle the root causes of the issues of violence that we have in the capital that happen 365 days of the year.\" Read more from Sky News:Travel disruption over bank holidayDavid Lammy avoids fishing fineAsylum housing is political trap In the run-up to the event, the Metropolitan Police have arrested more than 100 people who had planned to attend and seized dozens of knives and firearms. Commander Charmain Brenyah from the force explains that while the event \"creates unique challenges\" due to its size and scale, the security operation has been months in the planning. \"All of that work doesn't just start at carnival. It started in the weeks and months previous to that, where we've been taking people off the streets to make sure they don't come to carnival to cause harm. \"We've made 100 arrests of people for various offences. We've recalled 21 people to prison. We've taken 11 firearms off the street and 40 knives. This is all about making sure that people come to the event and have a safe and secure carnival.\" Mr Phillip, the carnival's chief executive, is adamant, the event is safe. \"We've put a lot of measures in place, as we always do, but even more so this year, to keep people safe,\" says Mr Phillip. \"Carnival is a safe space, it's no more unsafe than the rest of London. So I would say come and, you know, be respectful. We want everybody to come and be respectful and care for each other. But carnival it's a safe space.\" Cher's family say she would not want the event stopped, the young mother adored music and dancing, especially at carnival. But moving it, her cousin Mr Hoo says, could keep everyone safe. \"They can't put enough precautions in place to make it safe. That's the reality. It's absolutely unmanageable in its current format.\""

        "Content": " The government has taken the first step in appealing a court's decision that asylum seekers cannot be housed in an Essex hotel. The Home Office is seeking permission to intervene in the case, which, if granted, will allow it to appeal the interim judgment handed down last week. Epping Forest District Council sought an interim High Court injunction to stop migrants from being accommodated at The Bell Hotel in Epping, which is owned by Somani Hotels Limited.  The interim injunction demanded the hotel be cleared of its occupants within 14 days. In a ruling on Tuesday, Mr Justice Eyre granted the temporary block, but extended the time limit by which it must stop housing asylum seekers to 12 September. Somani Hotels will now appeal against the court order blocking the use of the hotel as accommodation for asylum seekers, the company's solicitors have said. Meanwhile, security minister Dan Jarvis said on Friday that closing hotels housing asylum seekers must be done \"in a managed and ordered way\" as he unveiled government plans to challenge the High Court's decision. \n                  Labour may have walked into political trap over housing asylum seekers in hotels\n                 \n                  18 councils pursuing or considering legal action to block asylum hotels\n                 \n                  The latest migration stats are going in the wrong direction - and the argument might get more vicious\n                 He told broadcasters: \"This government will close all asylum hotels and we will clear up the mess that we inherited from the previous government. \"We've made a commitment that we will close all of the asylum hotels by the end of this parliament, but we need to do that in a managed and ordered way. \"And that's why we'll appeal this decision.\" An analysis by Sky News has found 18 other councils are also actively pursuing or considering similar legal challenges to block asylum hotels - including Labour-run Tamworth and Wirral. Disquiet with the use of asylum hotels is at a high after the latest statistics showed there were more than 32,000 asylum seekers currently staying in hotels, marking a rise of 8% during Labour's first year in office. The number of small boat crossings in the Channel is also up 38% on the previous 12 months.  Following the Epping case, a wave of protests is expected outside of asylum hotels across the country in the coming days. Stand Up To Racism is preparing to hold counter-protests outside the asylum hotels on Friday, including in Bournemouth, Cardiff and Leeds, with further demonstrations expected on Saturday.  In its case, Epping Forest District Council argued that the owners of the Bell Hotel did not have planning permission to use the premises to accommodate asylum seekers. It argued that the injunction was needed amid \"unprecedented levels of protest and disruption\" in connection with the accommodation. Shadow justice secretary Robert Jenrick said the people of Epping who protested and its council have \"led the way\", writing in The Telegraph that \"our country's patience has snapped\". His Conservative colleague Chris Philp, the shadow home secretary, said on Thursday that people have \"every right\" to protest over asylum hotels in their areas. Kemi Badenoch, the Tory leader, has urged councils to explore legal challenges - with Conservative-run Broxbourne Council announcing that it would do so. Read more:A council-by-council breakdown of asylum seekers in hotelsWho says what on asylum hotels?Labour smell dirty tricks over asylum hotel court ruling Hillingdon Council, which is also controlled by the Tories, also said it was exploring its options.

He said West Northamptonshire, which Reform seized control of in May's local elections, would be doing so. In a further headache for Sir Keir Starmer, Labour-controlled councils are also considering legal action, including Wirral and Tamworth. Paula Basnett, the Labour leader of Wirral council, said: \"We are actively considering all options available to us to ensure that any use of hotels or other premises in Wirral is lawful and does not ride roughshod over planning regulations or the wishes of our communities.\" Carol Dean, the Labour leader of Tamworth Borough Council, said she understood the \"strong feelings\" of residents about the use of a local hotel to house asylum seekers, and added: \"We are closely monitoring developments and reviewing our legal position\". Labour-controlled Stevenage council added: \"The council takes breaches of planning control seriously and we're actively investigating alleged breaches relating to the operation of hotels in Stevenage.\""

Already on the back foot after a judge ordered the Bell Hotel to be emptied of asylum seekers, the Home Office is now being attacked for trying to appeal that decision. \"The government isn't listening to the public or to the courts,\" said Tory shadow home secretary Chris Philp. The politics is certainly difficult. Government sources are alive to that fact, even accusing the Tory-led Epping Council of \"playing politics\" by launching the legal challenge in the first place. The fact Labour councils are now also considering claims undermines that somewhat. After all, the party did promise to shut every asylum hotel by the next election. \n                  Government takes first step in appealing court ruling banning asylum seekers from Epping hotel\n                 \n                  18 councils pursuing or considering legal action to block asylum hotels\n                 \n                  The latest migration stats are going in the wrong direction - and the argument might get more vicious\n                 Figures out this week showed an increase in the number of migrants in hotels since the Tories left office. And now, an attempt to keep people in a hotel that's become a flashpoint for anger. That's why ministers are trying to emphasise that closing the Bell Hotel is a matter of when, not if.  \"We've made a commitment that we will close all of the asylum hotels by the end of this parliament, but we need to do that in a managed and ordered way\", said the security minister Dan Jarvis. The immediate problem for the Home Office is the same one that caused hotels to be used in the first place. There are vanishingly few accommodation options.  Labour has moved away from using old military sites. That's despite one RAF base in Essex - which Sir Keir Starmer had promised to close - seeing an increase in the number of migrants being housed. Back in June, the immigration minister told MPs that medium-sized sites like disused tower blocks, old teacher training colleges or redundant student accommodation could all be used. Until 2023, regular residential accommodation was relied on. Read more from Sky News:Rise in migrants staying in hotelsTown 'changed' by immigrationExplainer: Where can migrants stay? But getting hold of more flats and houses could be practically and politically difficult, given shortages of homes and long council waiting lists. All of this is why previous legal challenges made by councils have ultimately failed. The government has a legal duty to house asylum seekers at risk of destitution, so judges have tended to decide that blocking off the hotel option runs the risk of causing ministers to act unlawfully. So to return to the previous question. Yes, the government may well have walked into a political trap here. But it probably had no choice."

In their eyes, carnival has been tainted by the memories of last year when 32-year-old Cher was killed in front of her young daughter in an unexpected, unprovoked attack in the middle of carnival's 'family day'. Cher's family say she would not want the event to stop, but that its \"current format\" is unsafe. \"Where some people say, wrong place, wrong time. She was in the right place, at the right time, where she should have been, and still she wasn't safe,\" says Lawrence Hoo, Cher's cousin. Mr Hoo says the event is not set up to protect carnival-goers: \"She was in the safest location possible on family day with her daughter and she was murdered directly in front of police officers, so if it can happen there, it can happen anywhere, in all honesty, it's an unmanageable event.\" \n                  100 arrests ahead of Notting Hill Carnival in 'intelligence-led interventions', Met Police say\n                 \n                  Man charged with murder after fatal stabbing of ice cream seller in Wembley\n                 \n                  'Ice cream seller stabbed eight times' as police arrest two in Wembley\n                 Last year, the number of carnival-related crimes were down on the year before, and the majority were related to drug offences. Cher was one of two people murdered at last year's event. Mr Hoo says the threat of violence hasn't gone away: \"Really, one murder is a murder too many. I believe that has become too dangerous. \"Could it happen again? Of course it could happen again. Of course, it could happen again. You could turn up the day before, you could be there, you can step out of the front door, you're in the site. I think it's an unmanageable location.\" Cher's grandmother, Vyleen Maximen, wants the international three-day event to be moved. \"When I had the meeting with them, I said 'why can't you move it to a different place? ie Hyde Park - that's a big enough park'. I was told 'well, it wouldn't be called Notting Hill Carnival'.\" For the family it comes down to concerns around who attends the street parade. The perceived lack of screening for individuals with weapons worries them. \"This is why I would like it moved,\" Ms Maximen said. \"I mean, it's not up to me. This is just my personal opinion. Have it structured, this is the way in, then the way out, but on the streets you can do whatever and just escape through the streets.\" This weekend, carnival organisers say 7,000 officers and staff will be on site each day with live facial recognition cameras and screening arches used at the busiest entry points. The option of moving the event however is not up for discussion, says Matthew Phillip, Notting Hill Carnival's chief executive. \"Carnival should remain on the streets of Notting Hill. It's where it started, it's a community event. Unfortunately, it has been marred by incidents. \"Our hearts are very much with the family, but carnival should remain on in the streets of Notting Hill. What we need to do is actually tackle the root causes of the issues of violence that we have in the capital that happen 365 days of the year.\" Read more from Sky News:Travel disruption over bank holidayDavid Lammy avoids fishing fineAsylum housing is political trap In the run-up to the event, the Metropolitan Police have arrested more than 100 people who had planned to attend and seized dozens of knives and firearms. Commander Charmain Brenyah from the force explains that while the event \"creates unique challenges\" due to its size and scale, the security operation has been months in the planning. \"All of that work doesn't just start at carnival. It started in the weeks and months previous to that, where we've been taking people off the streets to make sure they don't come to carnival to cause harm. \"We've made 100 arrests of people for various offences. We've recalled 21 people to prison. We've taken 11 firearms off the street and 40 knives. This is all about making sure that people come to the event and have a safe and secure carnival.\" Mr Phillip, the carnival's chief executive, is adamant, the event is safe. \"We've put a lot of measures in place, as we always do, but even more so this year, to keep people safe,\" says Mr Phillip. \"Carnival is a safe space, it's no more unsafe than the rest of London. So I would say come and, you know, be respectful. We want everybody to come and be respectful and care for each other. But carnival it's a safe space.\" Cher's family say she would not want the event stopped, the young mother adored music and dancing, especially at carnival. But moving it, her cousin Mr Hoo says, could keep everyone safe. \"They can't put enough precautions in place to make it safe. That's the reality. It's absolutely unmanageable in its current format.\""

        "Content": "A Northampton childminder who was jailed for inciting racial hatred after the Southport murders has said she is considering legal action against the police. Lucy Connolly was released from HMP Peterborough on Thursday, nine months into her 31-month sentence, after she pleaded guilty to inciting racial hatred by publishing and distributing \"threatening or abusive\" written material on X. The 42-year-old posted in an apparent reference to asylum seekers staying in UK hotels on 29 July - the day three girls were killed in Southport - last year: \"Mass deportation now, set fire to all the f****** hotels full of the bastards for all I care... if that makes me racist so be it.\" The mother-of-three, whose husband is a Conservative councillor, had shared the post after false rumours circulated online that the Southport murderer was an asylum seeker. He was later named as UK-born teenager Axel Rudakubana.  Connolly's post was viewed 310,000 times in three-and-a-half hours before she deleted it. Shortly after her release from prison, Connolly accused officials of issuing \"false information\" over her police interview. She told The Telegraph and Dan Wootton's show on YouTube that she was considering legal action over a statement which suggested she told officers in her police interview that she did not like immigrants. \"I do believe that they, you know, issued false information. I do think that they crossed the line and they didn't do things they should and I will be taking that up with them,\" she told Wootton. \"How far I take that, I don't know at this point, but it is definitely something I'll be taking up with them.\" She told The Telegraph that police were \"dishonest\" and her words were \"massively twisted and used against me\" in a statement released by the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS). A press release from the CPS after her guilty plea on 2 September included a quote from Frank Ferguson, head of the CPS Special Crime and Counter Terrorism Unit, which said: \"During police interview Lucy Connolly stated she had strong views on immigration, told officers she did not like immigrants and claimed that children were not safe from them.\" Connolly said she will release the content of the police interview so people can see what the police and the CPS said are \"two very different things to what I said in my interview\". She added: \"I made it quite clear to them that I know the difference between immigration and illegal immigration. But I feel that that was massively twisted and used against me.\" The CPS declined to comment any further when approached, but pointed Sky News to their updated release, where the word \"illegal\" appeared to have been added to the original statement. A Northamptonshire Police spokesperson said: \"We are aware of comments made by Lucy Connolly in an interview following her release from prison. \"We hope to contact Mrs Connolly in the coming days to understand the issues she has raised around Northamptonshire Police.\" Read more from Sky News:Govt wants to appeal asylum seeker hotel rulingHow many asylum seekers are housed in your area? Speaking with Wootton, the host claimed Connolly would meet representatives of the Trump administration on Saturday. Asked about that meeting, Connolly said: \"Not much, just that they're very interested in the way things are going in the UK, and they are obviously big advocates for free speech, and their lawyers are keen to speak with me.\" She also told Wootton: \"I should never have said what I said. It was wrong. \"But I am no far-right activist. I'm no far-right thug.\" At Connolly's sentencing at Birmingham Crown Court in October, Judge Melbourne Inman KC said: \"Some people used that tragedy as an opportunity to sow division and hatred, often using social media, leading to a number of towns and cities being disfigured.\" He added: \"When you published those words, you were well aware how volatile the situation was. That volatility led to serious disorder where mindless violence was used.\""

        "Content": "\n          Culture and entertainment reporter\n              @gemmapeplow\n  Actor Noel Clarke has lost his High Court libel case against the publisher of The Guardian, over a series of news articles which featured claims from a number of women. The first article, published in April 2021, said some 20 women who knew Clarke in a professional capacity had come forward with allegations of sexual misconduct. The 49-year-old actor, writer and director, best known for his 2006 film Kidulthood and starring in Doctor Who, sued the publisher and vehemently denied \"any sexual misconduct or wrongdoing\" - but the court has found Guardian News and Media (GNM) successfully defended the legal action on the grounds of truth and public interest. Read more:The key allegations against Noel Clarke - and the judge's response The meanings of all eight of the newspaper's publications were found to be \"substantially true\", the judge, Mrs Justice Steyn, said in a summary of the findings. \"I have accepted some of Mr Clarke's evidence... but overall I find that he was not a credible or reliable witness,\" she said. In her ruling, the judge also said suggestions that more than 20 witnesses, \"none of whom are parties or have a stake in this case, as [Clarke] does\" had come to court to lie was \"inherently implausible\". From the evidence heard, it was \"clear that women have been speaking about their experiences of working with Mr Clarke for many years\", she said. 'A deserved victory for women who suffered' Lucy Osborne and Sirin Kale, the journalists who carried out the investigation, told Sky News they had always been confident in everything published. \"I think that this is not a problem that's going to go away,\" said Osborne. \"This kind of behaviour very much still happens in the TV and film industry and other industries. So I do hope this judgment gives other women the confidence to speak out about what they've experienced.\" Read more: The key allegations - and judge's response Guardian editor-in-chief Katharine Viner described the ruling as \"a deserved victory for those women who suffered because of the behaviour of Noel Clarke\". She continued: \"Going to court is difficult and stressful, yet more than 20 women agreed to testify in the High Court, refusing to be bullied or intimidated. \"This is also a landmark judgment for Guardian journalism, and for investigative journalism in Britain... The judgment is clear that our investigation was thorough and fair, a template for public interest journalism.\" Clarke's response Clarke described the result as disappointing and maintained he believes the newspaper's reporting was \"inaccurate and damaging\". \"I have never claimed to be perfect,\" he said. \"But I am not the person described in these articles. Overnight I lost everything.\" He said he wanted to thank witnesses who supported his case, as well as his family, \"who never stopped believing there was something worth fighting for\". Arts and entertainment correspondent Noel Clarke isn't the first man working within the entertainment industry to fail to grasp that with power comes responsibility, and sadly I suspect he won’t be the last. As he licked his wounds following the judge's verdict, the foot-stamping also continued. \"I have never claimed to be perfect... but I am not the person described in these articles,\" he insisted. The judge disagreed. There is no workplace where unwanted kissing should be acceptable. For some reason, in TV and film the attitude that different rules apply has permeated for decades. Spoiler alert: they don't. It's inexcusable that anyone in a professional environment could be belittled or subjected to unwanted sexual advances or comments. The Guardian's win is a significant judgment for investigative journalism and the role a free press plays in bringing serious allegations into the public domain. And once again, while we all look at the one man, you also have to think about those who surrounded him who enjoyed the ride. Those who didn't challenge him. Those who were happy to piggy-back off of his popularity, who didn't pull him up. His ego, that sense of invincibility, wasn't an overnight thing. On shoots, his behaviour had clearly become normalised – somebody could, and should, have called it out. What happened during the trial? The trial took place from early March to early April 2025, hearing evidence from multiple witnesses who made accusations against Clarke, including that he had allegedly shared nude photographs of them without their consent, groped them, and asked them to look at him when he was exposed. Clarke also gave evidence over several days. At one stage, the actor appeared visibly emotional as he claimed the publisher had \"smashed my life\" with its investigation. His lawyer told the court he had been made a \"scapegoat\" and was an \"easy target\", as a star at the height of his success when the media industry \"zealously sought to correct itself\" following the #MeToo movement. The actor had been handed the outstanding British contribution to cinema award at the BAFTAs just a few weeks before the report was published. Following the article, BAFTA announced it had suspended his membership. But lawyers for The Guardian told how newspaper's investigation was \"careful and thorough\", saying it had been carried out \"conscientiously\" by the journalists involved. In March 2022, police said the actor would not face a criminal investigation over the allegations."

        "Content": "\n          Culture and entertainment reporter\n              @gemmapeplow\n Multiple witnesses gave evidence about their experiences of working with Noel Clarke during his libel trial - including women who had \"nothing to gain and everything to lose\", say the Guardian journalists who carried out the investigation. Before the newspaper published its report on allegations of inappropriate behaviour and sexual misconduct in 2021, Clarke was a huge success story in the UK film and TV industry - the acclaimed filmmaker behind Kidulthood, star of hit shows including Doctor Who and Bulletproof, and recipient of a BAFTA rising star award and another for his contribution to British cinema. Clarke denied any allegations of inappropriate behaviour or sexual misconduct, and in 2022 he sued the publishers of the newspaper for libel. Following a trial earlier this year, a High Court judge, Mrs Justice Steyn, has now dismissed his claim, finding the meaning of the newspaper's report and other subsequent articles it published was \"substantially true\". The trial heard evidence from multiple witnesses, including some women whose real names were not used. Their accusations against the actor and filmmaker included claims of inappropriate comments, sharing nude photographs without consent, and groping. Here are some of the key allegations - and the judge's response.  'Maya' An actress known as \"Maya\" worked on one production with Clarke and also auditioned for another, the judge said. She alleged she had been subject to comments and looks from Clarke, and felt pressured to be naked during a scene for a TV programme. Recording of a phone call between Clarke and the actress was heard in court, including conversation about this scene. \"It was an uncomfortable experience,\" Maya said in the call. \"We were rehearsing the romantic scene… I didn't say anything to you. I felt pressured to be naked from you in that scene.\" Clarke said in court that he believed she was \"acting\" on the call ahead of making allegations against him. In her ruling, Mrs Justice Steyn found Maya had been \"sexually harassed, pressured and touched\" by Clarke without her consent. \"It is apparent that he was insensitive to the discomfort he provoked,\" the judge said. \"But as is clear from his comments in the recorded phone call, and from the evidence generally, Mr Clarke would habitually, and lasciviously, look young, attractive women up and down.\" Floor runner One woman who worked as a floor runner said her experience of working with Clarke was \"extremely unpleasant\" and that he was \"rude and continuously belittling\" towards her from the outset, according to court documents. She said Clarke did not behave the same way towards another male runner and that she \"dreaded being alone\" with him as she would be \"routinely undermined\". She said she became \"extremely anxious\" and had her first panic attack during filming when \"Noel was ignoring my instructions and I couldn't carry out my job\", which she described as humiliating. The judge found she gave \"clear, honest and reliable evidence\", and added: \"She was a young woman, in a far subordinate role, who he singled out for this belittling and bullying treatment. It is probable that he acted in this way for no other reasons than that he had the power to do so, and he found it amusing.\" 'Penelope' One actress, known as \"Penelope\", said she worked on a sex scene with Clarke and that they discussed \"perhaps wearing patches or covers\", but Noel was \"insistent that he didn't think this would work and said he wanted to 'keep it natural'.\" In her witness statement, Penelope said she begged him to stop asking her to look at him while he was exposed and to allow others back into the room. She said she felt \"disgusted, shocked and frightened\", and concerned that he had \"created an impression to the crew that I was complicit in whatever was happening behind that closed door\". In her ruling, the judge said she found Penelope to be an honest witness and found it was not necessary for her to be naked from the waist down for the scene. She added: \"I have not found that the requirement for 'Penelope' to be naked below the waist for the filming of the sex scene was introduced for Mr Clarke's sexual gratification, but he did then take advantage of it for that purpose.\" 'Imogen' Clarke invited an actress known as \"Imogen\" to dinner in 2014, when she was 20, the trial heard. Imogen alleged he propositioned her for sex and offered to take photos, and also talked about going to brothels and tried to kiss her on the street after the meal. He looked \"furious\" when she avoided his kiss, she claimed. Her account was \"honest\", and save for a few minor points, \"it was also reliable and accurate\", the judge found. 'Mila' Another actress known as \"Mila\" described taking part in a scene that required nudity from the waist down. During the shoot, he also told her to bend over, asked her to sit on his lap, and made inappropriate sexual comments, she said. Again, the judge found she had \"no reason to lie\". While Clarke denied the allegations, the judge concluded The Guardian had, save for a couple of points, proved its case in respect of Mila. Gina Powell Gina Powell was part of Clarke's production company, Unstoppable, between 2014 and 2017. She alleges he groped her in a lift, exposed himself to her in a car, and brushed off concerns about his sexual behaviour towards other women. He also kept naked pictures of others, she claimed. Ms Powell told the court she had been through years of \"guilt\" watching how Clarke behaved with other women, which led to her speaking out. The judge found that on one occasion where Clarke pinched Ms Powell's bottom when they were being photographed, \"his intent was not sexual\", and it was \"intended as a friendly and jocular attempt to provoke a startled expression\". However, she also ruled that Ms Powell was \"an honest, reliable\" witness and accepted the filmmaker had shown her nude photographs, as well as her evidence on what happened in the car and lift. 'Ivy' One woman, known only as \"Ivy\", said in a witness statement that she had had a brief relationship with Clarke, while he was married, and alleged she later discovered he had shared nude photographs of her without her consent. Ivy said she was \"horrified\" to discover later that the private images had been shown to others. \"Trusting him, I consensually sent him a small number of nude photos of myself,\" she said. \"I expressly told him that he should not show them to anyone... I believed that he would respect that.\" The court heard evidence from others who corroborated her account. The judge, in her ruling, found The Guardian had established Clarke \"revealed naked photographs\" of Ivy without her consent and shared them with others. Jing Lusi Actress Jing Lusi, known for films including Crazy Rich Asians and series including Gangs Of London and Red Eye, worked with Clarke on the film SAS: Red Notice, which was filmed in Budapest in 2018. She said that during a dinner, he suggested to her that they could do a read-through of the script in his \"bed\" or \"bedroom\". He also told her he had \"fantasised\" about her and described what he wanted to do to her, in a separate incident, she alleged. She said this left her feeling \"disgusted\". Clarke denied her allegations. In her ruling, Mrs Justice Steyn said that while she accepted Ms Lusi's account, she did find that in circumstances where Clarke's behaviour towards her was not an abuse of power, \"the events described did not assist the Guardian in establishing the truth defence\"."

        "Content": "The foreign secretary has been issued a formal warning by the Environment Agency after reporting himself for fishing with the US vice-president without a licence. David Lammy reported himself to the agency after an \"administrative oversight\" meant he failed to get a rod licence while hosting JD Vance at his grace-and-favour retreat in Chevening, Kent, on 8 August. Mr Lammy failed to catch any fish, although Mr Vance and his children were more successful, and returned their catches to the lake. At the time, a Foreign Office spokesperson said that, after recognising his mistake, Mr Lammy had subsequently purchased a licence. Anglers in England and Wales aged 13 or over must have a rod licence to fish for freshwater species. If they do not have one, they can face a fine of up to £2,500. On Friday, an Environment Agency spokesperson confirmed Mr Lammy would not be prosecuted, but had received a formal warning. They said: \"Everyone who goes fishing needs a licence to help improve our rivers, lakes and the sport anglers love. \"As Mr Lammy has confirmed, we have issued a warning letter for fishing without a licence, in line with our enforcement and sanctions policy.\"  The agency's first response to a breach is usually to issue advice or a warning, instead of prosecuting, particularly in cases involving inexperienced anglers with no history of fishing without a licence. In 2024/25, 765 people were prosecuted for breaching fishing rules, while 1,965 received warning letters and 159 were issued with advice and guidance.

The RAC urged drivers to set off as early as possible for their holiday getaways or \"be prepared to spend longer in traffic\". Major roads in the South East and South West are expected to be among the most congested, as nearly 18 million drivers are planning holiday trips. A strike planned for Saturday and Monday by CrossCountry train workers who belong to the Rail, Maritime and Transport (RMT) union will disrupt services throughout the bank holiday weekend. Additionally, passengers are being advised that several key routes will be closed due to engineering work, as Network Rail carries out 261 projects across the UK. The bank holiday in England, Wales, and Northern Ireland on Monday is the last before Christmas. The RAC expects 17.6 million getaway trips by car to take place in the UK between Friday and Monday. Three million journeys for holidays or day trips are expected on Friday, rising to 3.4 million on Saturday. Some 2.4 million leisure journeys are expected on Sunday and 2.7 million on Monday. The RAC said an additional 6.1 million drivers are planning a trip at some point between Friday and Monday. The figures are based on responses to a survey of 2,080 UK adults, projected onto the 34 million cars licensed in the UK. Travellers can experience motorway delays of over 40 minutes Transport analytics company Inrix is projecting that the M5 between Bristol and Devon will have the most severe getaway traffic. The section from junction 15, north of Bristol, to junction 23 for Bridgwater is expected to experience delays exceeding 40 minutes on Friday and Saturday. Delays of over 30 minutes are predicted on Friday along the M20 in Kent, a key route used by many vehicles travelling to Channel crossings at Dover or Folkestone. This advisory covers the stretch from junction seven near Maidstone to junction three (Addington Interchange), as well as from junction one at Swanley to junction five at Aylesford. RAC mobile servicing and repairs team leader Nick Mullender said: \"We're expecting major roads to airports and coastal destinations to be extremely busy, especially the south-east and south-west regions which could end up bearing the brunt of most holiday hold-ups. \"Anyone planning routes through these areas should set off as early as possible or be prepared to spend longer in traffic.\" Rail network delays  Due to industrial action on the rail network, there will be no CrossCountry services on Saturday. Major disruptions are expected on Sunday, while trains will run on a reduced schedule on Monday. Passengers are encouraged to avoid travelling on Saturday and to plan their journeys either before or after the bank holiday weekend, or to request a full refund.

        "Content": "The Metropolitan Police say they have arrested 100 people and seized dozens of knives and guns in what they are calling \"intelligence-led interventions\" ahead of this weekend's Notting Hill Carnival. Officers say they have seized 11 firearms and more than 40 knives as part of an operation \"against those who we have reason to believe pose the greatest risk to the safety\" of those attending the event, in west London. Police say 21 people have been recalled to prison, with a further 266 either on police bail or probation licence conditions that warn them against attending the event. It comes after two people died days after being attacked in separate incidents during last year's Carnival. The sister of one of them, Cher Maximen, said earlier this year that more must be done to address \"growing safety concerns\" about the \"iconic event\". Speaking outside the Old Bailey shortly after a man was convicted of murder, her sister Tanya Jacobs said the loss of Ms Maximen, who was stabbed in front of her daughter, had caused \"immeasurable sadness\". Last year, four stabbings were reported, and more than 103 arrests made for robbery, violence, sexual offences, drug offences and possession of weapons, with 18 officers assaulted. The year before it was 10, with seven reported in 2022, according to a Freedom of Information (FoI) request. Matthew Phillip, the event's chief executive, said organisers worked closely with police to try to keep people safe. Asked if the event could be ticketed in the future, he replied: \"Carnival will never be ticketed, it cannot be ticketed. Crime actually decreased last year on the previous year.\" More than one million to attend Police say they expect more than a million people to be on the streets of west London this weekend \"for what is one of the most significant weekends in the capital's cultural calendar\". Commander Charmain Brenyah, the Met's spokesperson for the event, said: \"The vast majority come to have fun and enjoy themselves, to celebrate Caribbean culture, to dance, to eat and to go home with nothing but good memories. \"Regrettably we know a minority come with less positive intentions and in recent years this has played out in the form of serious violence including three tragic incidents where lives have been taken. The history of Notting Hill Carnival \"The actions of this minority are totally at odds with the values of those who care passionately about Carnival and we acknowledge those, including the event organisers, who have stood up to condemn violence and serious criminality in the run up to this weekend.\"  During the event, officers will be deployed in \"significant numbers\" to deal with incidents, with around 7,000 police to be on duty across the capital this Sunday and Monday. A network of CCTV cameras, screening arches and live facial recognition cameras will also be deployed on the routes to and from Carnival. Stop and search powers will also be used to prevent weapons being carried in. Concerns had previously been raised about the facial recognition cameras, with Met Police Chief Sir Mark Rowley saying they would be used without bias. Last year, organisers of the event commissioned an independent review into crowd safety after incidents in recent years where the density of people reached dangerous levels. Commander Brenyah, said: \"It was welcome news that some additional funding was secured to allow the organisers to implement a number of the review's recommendations, but they have had limited time to do so meaning despite everyone's best efforts it's inevitable not all the risks will have been mitigated.\" \"We would also anyone attending Carnival to play their part by listening to stewards and officers if they're asking you to go in a certain direction or to pause before carrying on down a particular road. \"Please also read and respect signage, adhere to barriers and other crowd safety equipment and if you feel unsafe or like an area is becoming too crowded, be sensible and move away.\""

        "Headline": "Over half a million people are facing \"catastrophic conditions\", according to a report from the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC). The confirmation of famine in Gaza City is the IPC's first outside of Africa, and fifth since 2004.",
        "Content": " A famine has been declared in Gaza City and the surrounding neighbourhoods. The Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) - a globally recognised system for classifying the severity of food insecurity and malnutrition - has confirmed just four famines since it was established in 2004. These were in Somalia in 2011, and in Sudan in 2017, 2020, and 2024. The confirmation of famine in Gaza City is the IPC's first outside of Africa. \"After 22 months of relentless conflict, over half a million people in the Gaza Strip are facing catastrophic conditions characterised by starvation, destitution and death,\" the report said, adding that more than a million other people face a severe level of food insecurity. Over the next month, conditions are also expected to worsen, with the famine projected to expand to Deir al-Balah and Khan Younis, the report said. Nearly a third of the population (641,000 people) are expected to face catastrophic conditions, while acute malnutrition is projected to continue getting worse rapidly. \n                  Israel is accused of allowing famine to fester in Gaza and global condemnation is deafening\n                 \n                  Israel to continue with Gaza City offensive despite talks to free Hamas hostages\n                 \n                  What's it like with the National Guard on the streets of DC?\n                 The IPC defines famine as a situation in which at least one in five households has an extreme lack of food and face starvation and destitution, resulting in extremely critical levels of acute malnutrition and death. Famine is when an area has: • More than 20% of households facing extreme food shortages • More than 30% of children suffering from acute malnutrition • A daily mortality rate that exceeds two per 10,000 people, or four per 10,000 children under five The report said at least 132,000 children will suffer from acute malnutrition over the next year - double the organisation's estimates from May 2024. The IPC said the situation could be even worse further north in Gaza, but limited data prevented any precise classification. Israel says no famine in Gaza Volker Turk, the UN Human Rights chief, said the famine is the direct result of actions taken by the Israeli government. \"It is a war crime to use starvation as a method of warfare, and the resulting deaths may also amount to the war crime of wilful killing,\" he said. COGAT, the Israeli military agency that coordinates aid, has rejected the findings. Israel's foreign ministry said there is no famine in Gaza: \"Over 100,000 trucks of aid have entered Gaza since the start of the war, and in recent weeks a massive influx of aid has flooded the Strip with staple foods and caused a sharp decline in food prices, which have plummeted in the markets.\" Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the report was an \"outright lie\", adding that Israel \"does not have a policy of starvation\". \"Israel has a policy of preventing starvation. Since the beginning of the war Israel has enabled 2 million tons of aid to enter the Gaza Strip, over one ton of aid per person,\" he said in a statement. Ceasefire pleas to stop famine British Foreign Secretary David Lammy called the IPC report \"utterly horrifying and wholly preventable\", and demanded that Israel immediately allow unhindered supplies of food, medicines and fuel into Gaza. \"We desperately need an immediate ceasefire, to enable aid delivery at maximum speed and at the scale required. This includes halting the military operation in Gaza City which is the epicentre of the famine,\" Mr Lammy said in a statement. Europe correspondent Tom Fletcher, speaking on behalf of the United Nations, did not mince his words. Gaza was suffering from famine, the evidence was irrefutable and Israel had not just obstructed aid but had also used hunger as a weapon of war. His anger seeped through every sentence, just as desperation is laced through the report from the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC). Conditions are expected to worsen, it says, even though the Gaza Strip has been classified as a level 5 famine. There is no level 6. But it took only moments for the Israeli government to respond in terms that were just as strident. Read Adam Parsons' analysis here. Tom Fletcher, UN under-secretary general for humanitarian affairs, echoed Mr Lammy's comments as he made a desperate plea to Mr Netanyahu to declare a ceasefire in the wake of the famine announcement. \"My ask, my plea, my demand to Prime Minister Netanyahu and anyone who can reach him. Enough. Ceasefire. Open the crossings, north and south, all of them,\" he said. Read more from Sky News:Trump critic has home raided by the FBIMultiple people killed in tour bus crash UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said the Gaza famine was a \"man-made disaster, a moral indictment, and a failure of humanity itself\". The IPC had previously warned famine was imminent in parts of Gaza, but had stopped short of a formal declaration. The latest report on Gaza from the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) says there were almost 13,000 new admissions of children for acute malnutrition recorded in July. The latest numbers from the Gaza health ministry are 251 dead as a result of famine and malnutrition, including 108 children. But Israel has previously accused Hamas of inflating these figures, saying that most of the children who died had pre-existing health conditions."

        "Content": "By Simone Baglivo, Europe producer  The Ukrainian suspected of coordinating attacks on the Nord Stream pipelines had served in Ukraine's Secret Service and in the Ukrainian Army's special forces, Sky News understand.  Serhii K., 49, was arrested in northern Italy on Thursday following the issuance of a European arrest warrant by German prosecutors. It is not known whether he was still serving at the time of the pipeline attack in 2022 and Ukraine's government has always denied any involvement in the explosions. According to sources close to the case, the suspect has been found in a three-star bungalow hotel named La Pescaccia in San Clemente, in the province of Rimini.  When military officers from Italy's Carabinieri investigative and operational units raided his bedroom, he didn't try to resist the arrest. The hotel's employees have been questioned, but no further evidence or any weapons were found, the sources added. Serhii arrived on Italy's Adriatic coast earlier this week, and the purpose of his trip was a holiday. He was found with his two children and his wife. \n                   Italy arrests Ukrainian over Nord Stream attacks, German prosecutors say\n                 \n                  Oasis fan dies in hotel room hours before show in Edinburgh\n                 \n                  Thousands evacuated as deadly wildfires sweep Europe\n                 At least one of the four people within his family had a travel ticket issued in Poland. He crossed the Italian border with his car with a Ukrainian license plate last Tuesday. He was travelling with his passport, and he used his real identity to check into the hotel, triggering an emergency alert on a police server, we have been told. After the arrest, he was taken to the Rimini police station before being moved to a prison in Bologna, the regional capital, on Friday. Deputy Bologna Prosecutor Licia Scagliarini has granted the German judicial authorities' requests for Serhii's surrender, but Sky News understands the man told the appeal court that he doesn't consent to being handed over to Germany. He also denied the charges and said he was in Ukraine during the Nord Stream sabotage. He added that he is currently in Italy for family reasons. While leaving the court, he was seen making a typical Ukrainian nationalist 'trident' gesture to the reporters. The next hearing is scheduled for 3 September, when the Bologna appeal court is set to decide whether Serhii will be extradited to Germany or not. He will remain in jail until then. In Germany, he will face charges of collusion to cause an explosion, anti-constitutional sabotage and the destruction of structures. German prosecutors believe he was part of a group of people who planted devices on the pipelines near the Danish island of Bornholm in September 2022. Serhii and his accomplices are believed to have set off from Rostock on Germany's north-eastern coast in a sailing yacht to carry out the attack.

It represented a significant escalation in the Ukraine conflict and worsening of the continent's energy supply crisis. According to a US intelligence report leaked in 2023, a pro-Ukraine group was behind the attack. Yet, no group has ever claimed responsibility. Sky News understands Genoa's Prosecutor's Office in northern Italy has requested their colleagues in Bologna to share the information related to Serhii. Anti-terrorism prosecutors are investigating another alleged sabotage linked to the Russian shadow fleet oil tanker Seajewel, which sank off the port of Savona last February. On Thursday, they asked an investigative police unit to figure out whether there is a link between that episode and the Nord Stream attacks."

Gaza latest: UK calls out Israel for 'manmade catastrophe' Conditions are expected to worsen, it says, even though the Gaza Strip has been classified as a level 5 famine. There is no level 6. But it took only moments for the Israeli government to respond in terms that were just as strident. The report dismissed as wholly inaccurate, based on biased, inaccurate data and influenced not by fact, but by the whims of Hamas. COGAT, the Israeli agency that oversees humanitarian efforts in Gaza, claimed the IPC had ignored its data and presented a \"one-sided report\", before claiming that \"hundreds of truckloads of aid are still awaiting collection by the UN and international organisations\". What is so striking is that there is no grey area between these two versions. In one, Israel has obstructed the delivery of aid and allowed hunger to turn into famine; in the other, it is Hamas that has caused the crisis by stealing aid and exploiting hunger as a political tool to try to win global sympathy. Journalists are not allowed to enter Gaza, so we are reliant on the work of colleagues who live there. But the images are striking - emaciated people holding begging bowls, people scrambling towards aid drops or clambering over trucks carrying bags of flour. And all around them, shattered buildings. We heard from a man in his 70s, who used to weigh 70kg, but who has lost almost half his body weight. \"Now, because of malnutrition, my weight has dropped to just 40,\" Hassan Abu Seble said. \"I suffered both a stroke and a heart attack. They had to put in a stent to help me recover, and I thank God that my organs are still functioning.\" The Israeli government, and many across the country, will maintain that Hamas bears the responsibility for everything that has happened to Gazans - that it was the attack on 7 October, 2023, that was the sole precipitant for the suffering, death and hunger that has followed. But from around much of the rest of the world, the condemnation is deafening, accusing Israel of allowing famine to fester. David Lammy, Britain's foreign secretary, said the Israeli government had caused a \"man-made famine\" by blocking the distribution of aid, and described that as a \"moral outrage\". The question, as so often before, is what that rhetoric leads to. And, so long as the United States doesn't join the chorus of disapproval, does widespread global disapproval mean anything? There is also a question now of Gaza's future. Read more from Sky News:Israel to continue with Gaza City offensiveFamine is our 'worst fears being realised'Analysis: Netanyahu has a decision to make In the Jewish quarter of Jerusalem's Old City, we found a large sign that says \"Make Gaza Jewish Again\". It is a slogan, and a sentiment, that is supported by plenty. \"Yes, of course I agree,\" says one man as he walks past, carrying a large pack of drinks. It turns out that he used to live in a Jewish settlement in Gaza until it was shut by the Israeli government two decades ago, but he has never stopped believing that Gaza is rightly Israel's property. \"The people there now - they should leave. They could go to Jordan, Lebanon, Egypt. It is our land. And yes, I would like to go back there.\" He did not believe there was a famine. \"They have lots of food,\" he told me. Another man, Avraham, was more conciliatory, but insisted there had never been a country like Israel \"that is fighting a war against a country but is also sending in so much humanitarian aid for the people\". Gaza City is now the focal point of so much. Famine is spreading from this heart just as troops prepare to encircle the city. A ceasefire could come, but so could a huge military assault. And all the while, the hunger will get worse."

The search of Mr Bolton's house in Bethesda, Maryland, on Friday was part of a \"national security investigation in search of classified records\", reported NBC News, Sky's US partner network, citing a source. Mr Bolton has not been detained or apprehended. He served as Mr Trump's top security adviser for 17 months during his first term in office, but was forced out of the role in 2019. Mr Trump on Friday told reporters in Washington that he'd had no advance knowledge of the raid, adding: \"I'm not a fan of John Bolton.\" The US Justice Department is yet to comment, but FBI director Kash Patel posted on X on Friday morning, writing: \"NO ONE is above the law… @FBI agents on mission.\" An FBI official said in a statement that the agency was \"conducting court-authorised activity in the area\", indicating grounds had been approved for a search warrant. Mr Trump's former adviser is yet to respond to enquiries for comment. He was not at his home during the early morning raid, CNN reported. He was seen in his Washington DC office on Friday in talks with FBI officials, according to the Associated Press. US federal authorities are yet to release any details as to why the search has been conducted and what allegations may be levelled against Mr Bolton. CIA Director John Ratcliffe provided the intelligence to Mr Patel that served as the basis for the search warrant for Mr Bolton's home and office, a source told Sky News' US partner network. Unnamed sources reportedly told the New York Times that an investigation has been launched into whether Mr Bolton illegally shared or possessed classified information. NBC's source said the probe was looking into potential instances of the documents being leaked to journalists. During his time as adviser, Mr Bolton had clashed regularly with the president on policy direction over Iran and North Korea. He was viewed as a hawkish adviser, and Mr Trump has previously criticised him as \"warmongering\", saying he pushed him to take military action on Iran. Since leaving the post, Mr Bolton has called the Republican president unfit to serve, and most recently criticised Trump's actions in Ukraine and negotiations with Russian President Vladimir Putin. In 2020, Mr Bolton also published a memoir of his time in the White House, in which he described multiple instances of what he described as Mr Trump's misconduct and incompetence in handling foreign policy. 👉 Follow Trump100 on your podcast app 👈  He also alleged that the president often prioritised his own personal interests over national security. Prior to publication, Mr Trump's government had tried to block the release but failed in its legal bid. Since his return to office, Mr Trump has on multiple occasions sought to use his presidential powers against perceived political enemies. On his first day back in the White House, he revoked the security clearances of more than four dozen intelligence officials, including Mr Bolton. He also cancelled security detail for Mr Bolton and two other former Trump officials earlier this year. The officials had been receiving federal protection because of threats to their safety from Iran. Prior to working for Mr Trump during his first-term team, Mr Bolton had served in George W. Bush's administration as the US ambassador to the United Nations."

The Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, a  Marxist guerrilla organisation, was the largest of the country's rebel groups, and grew out of peasant self-defence forces. It was formed in 1964 as the military wing of the Colombian Communist Party, carrying out a series of attacks against political and economic targets. In 2016, after more than 50 years of civil war, FARC rebels and the Colombian government signed a peace deal. It officially ceased to be an armed group the following year - but some small dissident groups rejected the agreement and refused to disarm.

The first major study of the chemistry of the asteroid Bennu identified \"presolar grains\" - stardust that condensed around dying stars billions of years ago. An international team of scientists, including some from London's Natural History Museum, say the samples are a snapshot of the early Solar System, more pristine than any meteorite on Earth.   In one of NASA's most audacious missions the spacecraft Osiris Rex briefly touched the surface of Bennu, using a robotic arm to collect around 120g of material which was packed into a capsule and returned to Earth in 2023. Chemical analysis has now allowed scientists to piece together Bennu's origins in the cold, dense gas and dust of the early Solar System. Professor Jessica Barnes, from the University of Arizona, who is one of the study's authors, said: \"Our data suggest that Bennu's parent asteroid formed in the outer parts of the solar system, possibly beyond the orbit of Saturn.\" But the analysis also found a smorgasbord of other material in the sample, including organic matter from the outer Solar System and the interstellar medium - the gas and dust between stars - as well as high temperature materials that are thought to have formed close to the sun before drifting outwards.

The asteroid sample has proved to be an extraordinary window into the formation of the Solar System. Earlier this year, scientists announced it contained the building blocks of life. \"Studying Bennu has given us the opportunity to investigate a novel type of space rock, and we are learning new things about it every day,\" said Professor Russell. \"The lack of reaction with the Earth's atmosphere has given us the opportunity to study the history of the asteroid, and the evolution of the minerals it contains, in incomparable detail.\""

        "Content": " The US Justice Department has released a transcript of an interview with Ghislaine Maxwell - the jailed ex-girlfriend of paedophile financier Jeffrey Epstein. Maxwell said in the interview with Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche last month that she never saw US President Donald Trump in an \"inappropriate setting\". According to the transcript, Maxwell said: \"I never witnessed the president in any inappropriate setting in any way. The president was never inappropriate with anybody.\" Maxwell also recalled knowing about Mr Trump and possibly meeting him for the first time in 1990, when her newspaper magnate father, Robert Maxwell, was the owner of the New York Daily News. \"I may have met Donald Trump at that time, because my father was friendly with him and liked him very much,\" Maxwell said, according to the transcript. Maxwell said her father was fond of Mr Trump's then-wife, Ivana, \"because she was also from Czechoslovakia, where my dad was from\". She was sentenced in the US in June 2022 to 20 years in prison following her conviction on five counts of sex trafficking for luring young girls to massage rooms for Epstein to abuse. She has asked the US Supreme Court to overturn her conviction. Epstein, 66, was found dead in his cell at a Manhattan federal jail in August 2019 as he awaited trial on sex trafficking charges. His death was ruled a suicide. Trump 'was always very cordial' His case has generated endless attention and conspiracy theories due to his and Maxwell's links to famous people like royals, presidents and billionaires, including Mr Trump. No one other than Epstein and Maxwell has been charged with crimes. Mr Trump knew Epstein socially in the 1990s and early 2000s. During Maxwell's trial in 2021, Epstein's longtime pilot, Lawrence Visoski, said Mr Trump flew on Epstein's private plane several times. Mr Trump has denied flying on the plane. Maxwell, 63, said in her interview with the Justice Department that she never saw Mr Trump receive a massage. She told Mr Blanche that Mr Trump \"was always very cordial and very kind to me\", adding: \"And I just want to say that I admire his extraordinary achievement in becoming the president now.\" Read more: All we know about Donald Trump and Jeffrey Epstein's 'friendship' Maxwell denies introducing Epstein to Prince Andrew Maxwell also denied in the interview that she had ever introduced Prince Andrew to Epstein, and that the Duke of York could not have had sex at her house with Virginia Giuffre. Ms Giuffre, who died in April, sued the Duke of York for sexual abuse in August 2021, saying Andrew had sex with her when she was 17 and had been trafficked by Epstein. The duke has repeatedly denied the claims, and he has not been charged with any criminal offences. In March 2022, it was announced Ms Giuffre and Andrew had reached an out-of-court settlement - believed to include a \"substantial donation to Ms Giuffre's charity in support of victims' rights\".  Maxwell told the Justice Department: \"I did not introduce [Epstein] to Prince Andrew or to Sarah Ferguson. That is a flat untruth. I'll start with that.\" She insisted Epstein and the duke met separately, and said \"I think Sarah [Ferguson] is the one that pushed that\", before saying that allegations Andrew had sex with Ms Giuffre were untrue, as she was at her mother's 80th birthday celebrations in the countryside outside the city. She then claimed Ms Giuffre's allegation that she and Andrew had sexual contact in the bathroom of Maxwell's London flat was not true, as the room was not big enough. She also claimed that an image of her standing alongside Andrew with his arm around Ms Giuffre's waist was \"literally a fake photo\". The release of the transcript comes after Mr Trump has faced criticism from Republican supporters and Democrats over his Justice Department's decision not to release further details relating to Epstein, after the now US president promised to do so during the election. Read more: What you need to know about Trump, Epstein and the MAGA controversy  The Justice Department previously said a review of the Epstein case had found \"no incriminating 'client list'\" and \"no credible evidence\" the jailed financier had blackmailed famous men. In the transcript of the department's interview with Maxwell, Epstein’s former girlfriend said that she is not aware of any Epstein 'client list'. After her interview in July, Maxwell was moved to a minimum-security prison camp in Bryan, Texas, by the federal Bureau of Prisons (BOP) after she was held at a low-security prison in Tallahassee, Florida, that housed men and women. The Texas camp houses solely female prisoners, the majority of whom are serving time for non-violent offences and white-collar crimes. Neither Maxwell's lawyer nor the BOP gave a reason for the move. Maxwell's legal team have maintained that she was wrongly prosecuted and denied a fair trial, and have floated the idea of a pardon from Mr Trump.

I don't know anything about the case, but I know I have the right to do it. \"I have the right to give pardons, I've given pardons to people before, but nobody's even asked me to do it.\""

        "Content": "A tour bus returning to New York City from Niagara Falls has crashed on a major road, killing five people and injuring many others. The bus, with 52 passengers on board, crashed and rolled on Interstate 90 near Pembroke, about 30 miles (48km) east of Buffalo, in New York State, at around 12.30pm (5.30pm UK time). \"At this time we have multiple fatalities, multiple entrapments and multiple injuries,\" said Trooper James O'Callaghan, a spokesperson for the New York State Police. Some children were on board. Several people inside were thrown from the bus as the windows shattered, while some passengers became trapped in the wreckage. Erie County Medical Centre (ECMC) in Buffalo said it had received 24 patients. At a news conference, Dr Jennifer Pugh, chief of emergency medicine at ECMC, said two people had been taken to the operating theatre, one of whom had suffered internal injuries. Dr Jeffrey Brewer, chief of surgery, said he expected that two patients who had suffered the most serious injuries would recover. He added that people had been admitted with blunt trauma, head injuries and extremity (arm and leg) fractures. Millard Fillmore Suburban Hospital received another 11 patients, Buffalo General received four, while Oishei Children's Hospital took in three children. Mr O'Callahan said most people on the bus were Indian, Chinese, and Filipino, and translators were being brought to the scene. The driver survived and is cooperating with the police. He added: \"It's a full-size tour bus. Heavy amount of damage.

The highway has been closed in both directions, causing massive traffic delays at the onset of one of the last weekends of the summer vacation season. The falls, which are on the US-Canada border, are a major tourist attraction.

The search of Mr Bolton's house in Bethesda, Maryland, on Friday was part of a \"national security investigation in search of classified records\", reported NBC News, Sky's US partner network, citing a source. Mr Bolton has not been detained or apprehended. He served as Mr Trump's top security adviser for 17 months during his first term in office, but was forced out of the role in 2019. Mr Trump on Friday told reporters in Washington that he'd had no advance knowledge of the raid, adding: \"I'm not a fan of John Bolton.\" The US Justice Department is yet to comment, but FBI director Kash Patel posted on X on Friday morning, writing: \"NO ONE is above the law… @FBI agents on mission.\" An FBI official said in a statement that the agency was \"conducting court-authorised activity in the area\", indicating grounds had been approved for a search warrant. Mr Trump's former adviser is yet to respond to enquiries for comment. He was not at his home during the early morning raid, CNN reported. He was seen in his Washington DC office on Friday in talks with FBI officials, according to the Associated Press. US federal authorities are yet to release any details as to why the search has been conducted and what allegations may be levelled against Mr Bolton. CIA Director John Ratcliffe provided the intelligence to Mr Patel that served as the basis for the search warrant for Mr Bolton's home and office, a source told Sky News' US partner network. Unnamed sources reportedly told the New York Times that an investigation has been launched into whether Mr Bolton illegally shared or possessed classified information. NBC's source said the probe was looking into potential instances of the documents being leaked to journalists. During his time as adviser, Mr Bolton had clashed regularly with the president on policy direction over Iran and North Korea. He was viewed as a hawkish adviser, and Mr Trump has previously criticised him as \"warmongering\", saying he pushed him to take military action on Iran. Since leaving the post, Mr Bolton has called the Republican president unfit to serve, and most recently criticised Trump's actions in Ukraine and negotiations with Russian President Vladimir Putin. In 2020, Mr Bolton also published a memoir of his time in the White House, in which he described multiple instances of what he described as Mr Trump's misconduct and incompetence in handling foreign policy. 👉 Follow Trump100 on your podcast app 👈  He also alleged that the president often prioritised his own personal interests over national security. Prior to publication, Mr Trump's government had tried to block the release but failed in its legal bid. Since his return to office, Mr Trump has on multiple occasions sought to use his presidential powers against perceived political enemies. On his first day back in the White House, he revoked the security clearances of more than four dozen intelligence officials, including Mr Bolton. He also cancelled security detail for Mr Bolton and two other former Trump officials earlier this year. The officials had been receiving federal protection because of threats to their safety from Iran. Prior to working for Mr Trump during his first-term team, Mr Bolton had served in George W. Bush's administration as the US ambassador to the United Nations."

        "Content": "Erik Menendez, the younger of the notorious brothers who were jailed for murdering their parents in Los Angeles in 1989, has been denied parole. He made his first appeal for release from jail on Thursday, months after a judge reduced both his and his brother Lyle's sentences, making them eligible for parole. The brothers, aged 57 and 54, had received life sentences without the chance of parole in 1996 after being convicted of murdering their parents, Jose and Kitty Menendez, at their Beverly Hills home. The case was thrust back into the spotlight last year when Netflix released a documentary and miniseries. A panel of two California commissioners determined Erik Menendez should not be freed following an all-day hearing, where they heard about his behaviour in prison. While relatives of Menendez advocated for his release, commissioner Robert Barton said: \"Two things can be true. They can love and forgive you, and you can still be found unsuitable for parole.\" 'I was destroying my life' Mr Barton added the primary reason for denying him release was due to his conduct behind bars: Menendez is alleged to have worked with a prison gang, bought drugs, used mobile phones and helped with a tax scam while in jail. During the hearing, Menendez said he had no hope of being released until Los Angeles prosecutors asked a judge to resentence him and his brother last November, and had focused on protecting himself. \"In November of 2024, now the consequences mattered,\" he added. \"Now the consequences meant I was destroying my life.\" He also noted that the day of the hearing was almost exactly 36 years after he killed his parents, describing it as the \"anniversary\" of a \"trauma journey\".  During the hearing, Los Angeles prosecutor Habib Balian questioned whether Menendez was \"truly reformed\", or saying what commissioners wanted to hear. \"When one continues to diminish their responsibility for a crime and continues to make the same false excuses that they've made for 30-plus years, one is still that same dangerous person that they were when they shotgunned their parents,\" he said. Thursday's verdict means he will next be eligible for parole in three years. Lyle Menendez will appear by video conference for his parole hearing on Friday.

Central bankers are gathering for an annual summit in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, where Mr Powell could indicate whether interest rates will be cut soon. The Fed hasn't reduced the cost of borrowing since December - despite repeated calls from Donald Trump to do so. By contrast, the European Central Bank has slashed rates four times in 2025, with the Bank of England opting for three cuts so far this year.  Money blog: Top tips for entering US under Trump The US president has nicknamed the Fed chairman \"Too Late\" Jerome Powell on social media - and has repeatedly called for his resignation. But Mr Powell has argued that interest rates can only be lowered when there are clear signs that inflation is returning to its 2% target. Today will mark his final keynote speech at Jackson Hole before his eight-year tenure at the Federal Reserve ends in May 2026. Past addresses have been known to move the markets, with reaction often amplified because of lower trading volumes during the summer months. Figures from the CME FedWatch tool show expectations for a US interest rate cut when policymakers next meet in September are on the decline. One week ago, the probability of a 0.25 percentage point cut was priced in at 85.4%. But that fell to 82.4% on Thursday - and has dropped further to 73.3% at the time of writing. It comes as other senior officials within the Federal Reserve, speaking on the sidelines of the three-day summit in Jackson Hole, continued to express caution.

        "Content": "\n          News reporter\n              @ConnorSephton\n TikTok is putting hundreds of jobs at risk in the UK, as it turns to artificial intelligence to assess problematic content. The video-sharing app said a global restructuring is taking place that means it is \"concentrating operations in fewer locations\". Layoffs are set to affect those working in its trust and safety departments, who focus on content moderation. Money latest: Big day for US stocks - as FTSE 100 hits record high  Unions have reacted angrily to the move - and claim \"it will put TikTok's millions of British users at risk\". Figures from the tech giant, obtained by Sky News, suggest more than 85% of the videos removed for violating its community guidelines are now flagged by automated tools. Meanwhile, it is claimed 99% of problematic content is proactively removed before being reported by users. \n                  AI 'immune system' Phoebe lands backing from Google arm\n                 \n                  Publishers issue warning on AI-created books imitating sports autobiographies\n                 \n                  NHS to use AI technology to help free up hospital beds\n                 Executives also argue that AI systems can help reduce the amount of distressing content that moderation teams are exposed to - with the number of graphic videos viewed by staff falling by 60% since this technology was implemented. It comes weeks after the Online Safety Act came into force, which means social networks can face huge fines if they fail to stop the spread of harmful material. The Communication Workers Union has claimed the redundancy announcement \"looks likely to be a significant reduction of the platform's vital moderation teams\". In a statement, it warned: \"Alongside concerns ranging from workplace stress to a lack of clarity over questions such as pay scales and office attendance policy, workers have also raised concerns over the quality of AI in content moderation, believing such 'alternatives' to human work to be too vulnerable and ineffective to maintain TikTok user safety.\" John Chadfield, the union's national officer for tech, said many of its members believe the AI alternatives being used are \"hastily developed and immature\". He also alleged that the layoffs come a week before staff were due to vote on union recognition. \"That TikTok management have announced these cuts just as the company's workers are about to vote on having their union recognised stinks of union-busting and putting corporate greed over the safety of workers and the public,\" he added.

The tech giant currently employs more than 2,500 people in the UK, and is due to open a new office in central London next year. A TikTok spokesperson said: \"We are continuing a reorganisation that we started last year to strengthen our global operating model for Trust and Safety, which includes concentrating our operations in fewer locations globally to ensure that we maximize effectiveness and speed as we evolve this critical function for the company with the benefit of technological advancements.\""

        "Content": "\n          City editor\n              @MarkKleinmanSky\n Sanjeev Gupta, the metals tycoon who saw his main UK business forced into insolvency this week, is facing a struggle to secure the funding required for a competitive bid to regain control of it. Sky News understands that an asset-based loan from BlackRock, the world's biggest asset manager, would be expensive for Mr Gupta, with one source suggesting a similar arrangement struck in his other international operations came at an interest rate of approximately 15%. Mr Gupta also claimed in a witness statement presented in court this week that Fidera, a London-based investment firm, was in \"advanced\" discussions to back his offer to re-acquire SSUK through a pre-pack administration. Executives at Mr Gupta's Liberty Steel group said on Thursday after the Official Receiver took control of Speciality Steel UK - which employs nearly 1,500 people at steel plants in South Yorkshire - that he would seek to buy it back. \"[Gupta Family Group] will now continue to advance its bid for the business in collaboration with prospective debt and equity partners and will present its plan to the official receiver,\" Jeffrey Kabel, chief transformation officer, at Liberty Steel, said. \"GFG continues to believe it has the ideas, management expertise and commitment to lead SSUK into the future and attract major investment.\" While BlackRock is understood to remain willing to participate in a deal, the prospect of Fidera's involvement appears to be remote. \n                  TikTok puts hundreds of UK jobs at risk\n                 \n                  'Today is payday': Union warns wages for workers at liquidated steel company must be a priority\n                 \n                  Money latest: British Airways reveals new long-haul flights for 2026\n                 The firm would not comment on Friday, but sources close to it said it had had only one meeting with Mr Gupta and that it had been about debt, rather than equity, funding. That leaves Mr Gupta needing to find tens of millions of pounds to fund a bid within weeks, with the special manager acting on behalf of the Official Receiver expected to launch a formal sale process for SSUK as early as next week, according to Whitehall sources. The tycoon's allies labelled the decision to force SSUK into compulsory liquidation as \"irrational\". \"The plan that GFG presented to the court would have secured new investment in the UK steel industry, protecting jobs and establishing a sustainable operational platform under a new governance structure with independent oversight,\" Mr Kabel added. \"Instead, liquidation will now impose prolonged uncertainty and significant costs on UK taxpayers for settlements and related expenses, despite the availability of a commercial solution.\" Earlier this week, Sky News revealed that Mr Gupta was plotting to hand control of SSUK to his family in a bid to avert a government-orchestrated fire-sale. One source close to the situation claimed that the ownership structure devised by Mr Gupta would be independent, ring-fenced from him and have \"robust standards of governance\" - although that suggestion was always likely to be viewed with extreme suspicion by observers of his once-sprawling global operations. Behind Tata Steel and British Steel, SSUK is the third-largest steel producer in the country. Other parts of Mr Gupta's empire have been showing signs of financial stress for years. Mr Gupta is said to have explored whether he could persuade the government to step in and support SSUK using the legislation enacted to take control of British Steel's operations. Whitehall insiders told Sky News in May that Mr Gupta's overtures had been rebuffed. He had previously sought government aid during the pandemic but that plea was also rejected by ministers. SSUK, which also operates from a site in Bolton, Lancashire, makes highly engineered steel products for use in sectors such as aerospace, automotive and oil and gas. Spokespeople for GFG and BlackRock declined to comment."

        "Content": "A union has welcomed the government taking over a troubled steel company, but is warning that payment for workers must be a top priority. Speciality Steels UK - which employs almost 1,500 people - was pushed into compulsory liquidation on Thursday, and is the third-largest producer in the country. It is part of the Liberty Steel empire owned by metals tycoon Sanjeev Gupta, and operates from sites in Rotherham and several other locations across South Yorkshire. The government has stressed it will cover staff wages and the running costs of the plants until a buyer is found. Speaking to Sky's Anna Jones, Community Union National Secretary Alun Davies said workers are \"concerned\" about the developments. He added: \"Today is payday - but because the bank accounts were closed, I think the special managers and the HR team now are working with the unions to get that pay in today or as soon as they can.\" With a bank holiday weekend fast approaching, workers may only receive their wages on Tuesday unless payments are made as a matter of urgency. \n                  TikTok puts hundreds of UK jobs at risk\n                 \n                  Gupta faces struggle to fund bid for insolvent UK steel arm\n                 \n                  Money latest: British Airways reveals new long-haul flights for 2026\n                 Mr Davies said he is confident that the plants have a future, telling Sky News: \"If we use British-made steel for British infrastructure projects, it creates jobs, it grows economies and it gets our economy back on track, which is what this Labour government is trying to do.\" While he said government investment is valuable, the union official cautioned: \"If we can find a decent buyer - a reputable steel company that knows what they're doing - we're open to all options. \"We're not going to just say nationalise or part-nationalise, it's what's best for the business and gets the business up and running as soon as possible … if the government takes ownership, that is a significant cost to the taxpayer.\" Mr Davies explained that many workers have been staying at home and on 85% pay, which is having a big impact on their mental health and wellbeing. In a statement, Community's General Secretary Roy Rickhuss described it as an \"extremely worrying time\" for the union's members - and said jobs must be protected in the event of restructuring or a transition to new ownership. Calling for 12 months of pension contributions to be secured alongside this month's paychecks, he added: \"Steelworkers at Liberty Steel are highly skilled and hugely experienced; they are quite frankly irreplaceable and will be critical to delivering future success for the businesses.\" Mr Rickhuss said the union has received \"firm assurances\" that efforts to address pay and pensions are under way - and welcomed the government's intervention. \"However, in taking control of the business the government has assumed responsibility for our livelihoods and our communities, and we will of course be holding them to account,\" he added.

Central bankers are gathering for an annual summit in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, where Mr Powell could indicate whether interest rates will be cut soon. The Fed hasn't reduced the cost of borrowing since December - despite repeated calls from Donald Trump to do so. By contrast, the European Central Bank has slashed rates four times in 2025, with the Bank of England opting for three cuts so far this year.  Money blog: Top tips for entering US under Trump The US president has nicknamed the Fed chairman \"Too Late\" Jerome Powell on social media - and has repeatedly called for his resignation. But Mr Powell has argued that interest rates can only be lowered when there are clear signs that inflation is returning to its 2% target. Today will mark his final keynote speech at Jackson Hole before his eight-year tenure at the Federal Reserve ends in May 2026. Past addresses have been known to move the markets, with reaction often amplified because of lower trading volumes during the summer months. Figures from the CME FedWatch tool show expectations for a US interest rate cut when policymakers next meet in September are on the decline. One week ago, the probability of a 0.25 percentage point cut was priced in at 85.4%. But that fell to 82.4% on Thursday - and has dropped further to 73.3% at the time of writing. It comes as other senior officials within the Federal Reserve, speaking on the sidelines of the three-day summit in Jackson Hole, continued to express caution.

Sky News has learnt that the two companies are in exclusive discussions about a deal following an auction of ThinCats conducted by bankers at Fenchurch Advisory Partners.

A deal to buy ThinCats would strengthen Shawbrook's alternative financing capabilities as it prepares for a £2bn flotation on the London Stock Exchange.

The company said that lending to owner-managed businesses had surged, especially following the autumn budget last November. In total, ThinCats has now lent more than £2bn to businesses across the UK, with assets under management standing at just under £1bn. ThinCats is run by chief executive Amany Attia, who is also a shareholder in the business.

Meanwhile, security minister Dan Jarvis said on Friday that closing hotels housing asylum seekers must be done \"in a managed and ordered way\" as he unveiled government plans to challenge the High Court's decision. \n                  Labour may have walked into political trap over housing asylum seekers in hotels\n                 \n                  18 councils pursuing or considering legal action to block asylum hotels\n                 \n                  The latest migration stats are going in the wrong direction - and the argument might get more vicious\n                 He told broadcasters: \"This government will close all asylum hotels and we will clear up the mess that we inherited from the previous government. \"We've made a commitment that we will close all of the asylum hotels by the end of this parliament, but we need to do that in a managed and ordered way. \"And that's why we'll appeal this decision.\" An analysis by Sky News has found 18 other councils are also actively pursuing or considering similar legal challenges to block asylum hotels - including Labour-run Tamworth and Wirral. Disquiet with the use of asylum hotels is at a high after the latest statistics showed there were more than 32,000 asylum seekers currently staying in hotels, marking a rise of 8% during Labour's first year in office. The number of small boat crossings in the Channel is also up 38% on the previous 12 months.  Following the Epping case, a wave of protests is expected outside of asylum hotels across the country in the coming days. Stand Up To Racism is preparing to hold counter-protests outside the asylum hotels on Friday, including in Bournemouth, Cardiff and Leeds, with further demonstrations expected on Saturday.  In its case, Epping Forest District Council argued that the owners of the Bell Hotel did not have planning permission to use the premises to accommodate asylum seekers. It argued that the injunction was needed amid \"unprecedented levels of protest and disruption\" in connection with the accommodation. Shadow justice secretary Robert Jenrick said the people of Epping who protested and its council have \"led the way\", writing in The Telegraph that \"our country's patience has snapped\". His Conservative colleague Chris Philp, the shadow home secretary, said on Thursday that people have \"every right\" to protest over asylum hotels in their areas. Kemi Badenoch, the Tory leader, has urged councils to explore legal challenges - with Conservative-run Broxbourne Council announcing that it would do so.

Meanwhile, former Reform chairman Zia Yusuf told Sky News three councils run by his party had the power to mount legal challenges. He said West Northamptonshire, which Reform seized control of in May's local elections, would be doing so. In a further headache for Sir Keir Starmer, Labour-controlled councils are also considering legal action, including Wirral and Tamworth. Paula Basnett, the Labour leader of Wirral council, said: \"We are actively considering all options available to us to ensure that any use of hotels or other premises in Wirral is lawful and does not ride roughshod over planning regulations or the wishes of our communities.\" Carol Dean, the Labour leader of Tamworth Borough Council, said she understood the \"strong feelings\" of residents about the use of a local hotel to house asylum seekers, and added: \"We are closely monitoring developments and reviewing our legal position\". Labour-controlled Stevenage council added: \"The council takes breaches of planning control seriously and we're actively investigating alleged breaches relating to the operation of hotels in Stevenage.\""

        "Content": "\n          Political correspondent\n              @robpowellnews\n  Has the government just walked into a giant political elephant trap by attempting to reverse the Epping hotel ruling? Already on the back foot after a judge ordered the Bell Hotel to be emptied of asylum seekers, the Home Office is now being attacked for trying to appeal that decision. \"The government isn't listening to the public or to the courts,\" said Tory shadow home secretary Chris Philp. The politics is certainly difficult. Government sources are alive to that fact, even accusing the Tory-led Epping Council of \"playing politics\" by launching the legal challenge in the first place. The fact Labour councils are now also considering claims undermines that somewhat. After all, the party did promise to shut every asylum hotel by the next election. \n                  Government takes first step in appealing court ruling banning asylum seekers from Epping hotel\n                 \n                  18 councils pursuing or considering legal action to block asylum hotels\n                 \n                  The latest migration stats are going in the wrong direction - and the argument might get more vicious\n                 Figures out this week showed an increase in the number of migrants in hotels since the Tories left office. And now, an attempt to keep people in a hotel that's become a flashpoint for anger. That's why ministers are trying to emphasise that closing the Bell Hotel is a matter of when, not if.  \"We've made a commitment that we will close all of the asylum hotels by the end of this parliament, but we need to do that in a managed and ordered way\", said the security minister Dan Jarvis. The immediate problem for the Home Office is the same one that caused hotels to be used in the first place. There are vanishingly few accommodation options.  Labour has moved away from using old military sites. That's despite one RAF base in Essex - which Sir Keir Starmer had promised to close - seeing an increase in the number of migrants being housed. Back in June, the immigration minister told MPs that medium-sized sites like disused tower blocks, old teacher training colleges or redundant student accommodation could all be used. Until 2023, regular residential accommodation was relied on. Read more from Sky News:Rise in migrants staying in hotelsTown 'changed' by immigrationExplainer: Where can migrants stay? But getting hold of more flats and houses could be practically and politically difficult, given shortages of homes and long council waiting lists. All of this is why previous legal challenges made by councils have ultimately failed. The government has a legal duty to house asylum seekers at risk of destitution, so judges have tended to decide that blocking off the hotel option runs the risk of causing ministers to act unlawfully. So to return to the previous question. Yes, the government may well have walked into a political trap here. But it probably had no choice."

        "Content": "The foreign secretary has been issued a formal warning by the Environment Agency after reporting himself for fishing with the US vice-president without a licence. David Lammy reported himself to the agency after an \"administrative oversight\" meant he failed to get a rod licence while hosting JD Vance at his grace-and-favour retreat in Chevening, Kent, on 8 August. Mr Lammy failed to catch any fish, although Mr Vance and his children were more successful, and returned their catches to the lake. At the time, a Foreign Office spokesperson said that, after recognising his mistake, Mr Lammy had subsequently purchased a licence. Anglers in England and Wales aged 13 or over must have a rod licence to fish for freshwater species. If they do not have one, they can face a fine of up to £2,500. On Friday, an Environment Agency spokesperson confirmed Mr Lammy would not be prosecuted, but had received a formal warning. They said: \"Everyone who goes fishing needs a licence to help improve our rivers, lakes and the sport anglers love. \"As Mr Lammy has confirmed, we have issued a warning letter for fishing without a licence, in line with our enforcement and sanctions policy.\"  The agency's first response to a breach is usually to issue advice or a warning, instead of prosecuting, particularly in cases involving inexperienced anglers with no history of fishing without a licence.

        "Content": "A union has welcomed the government taking over a troubled steel company, but is warning that payment for workers must be a top priority. Speciality Steels UK - which employs almost 1,500 people - was pushed into compulsory liquidation on Thursday, and is the third-largest producer in the country. It is part of the Liberty Steel empire owned by metals tycoon Sanjeev Gupta, and operates from sites in Rotherham and several other locations across South Yorkshire. The government has stressed it will cover staff wages and the running costs of the plants until a buyer is found. Speaking to Sky's Anna Jones, Community Union National Secretary Alun Davies said workers are \"concerned\" about the developments. He added: \"Today is payday - but because the bank accounts were closed, I think the special managers and the HR team now are working with the unions to get that pay in today or as soon as they can.\" With a bank holiday weekend fast approaching, workers may only receive their wages on Tuesday unless payments are made as a matter of urgency. \n                  TikTok puts hundreds of UK jobs at risk\n                 \n                  Gupta faces struggle to fund bid for insolvent UK steel arm\n                 \n                  Money latest: British Airways reveals new long-haul flights for 2026\n                 Mr Davies said he is confident that the plants have a future, telling Sky News: \"If we use British-made steel for British infrastructure projects, it creates jobs, it grows economies and it gets our economy back on track, which is what this Labour government is trying to do.\" While he said government investment is valuable, the union official cautioned: \"If we can find a decent buyer - a reputable steel company that knows what they're doing - we're open to all options. \"We're not going to just say nationalise or part-nationalise, it's what's best for the business and gets the business up and running as soon as possible … if the government takes ownership, that is a significant cost to the taxpayer.\" Mr Davies explained that many workers have been staying at home and on 85% pay, which is having a big impact on their mental health and wellbeing. In a statement, Community's General Secretary Roy Rickhuss described it as an \"extremely worrying time\" for the union's members - and said jobs must be protected in the event of restructuring or a transition to new ownership. Calling for 12 months of pension contributions to be secured alongside this month's paychecks, he added: \"Steelworkers at Liberty Steel are highly skilled and hugely experienced; they are quite frankly irreplaceable and will be critical to delivering future success for the businesses.\" Mr Rickhuss said the union has received \"firm assurances\" that efforts to address pay and pensions are under way - and welcomed the government's intervention. \"However, in taking control of the business the government has assumed responsibility for our livelihoods and our communities, and we will of course be holding them to account,\" he added.

On Thursday, a government spokesperson said ministers \"remain committed to a bright and sustainable future for steelmaking and steelmaking jobs in the UK\"."

The first major study of the chemistry of the asteroid Bennu identified \"presolar grains\" - stardust that condensed around dying stars billions of years ago. An international team of scientists, including some from London's Natural History Museum, say the samples are a snapshot of the early Solar System, more pristine than any meteorite on Earth.   In one of NASA's most audacious missions the spacecraft Osiris Rex briefly touched the surface of Bennu, using a robotic arm to collect around 120g of material which was packed into a capsule and returned to Earth in 2023. Chemical analysis has now allowed scientists to piece together Bennu's origins in the cold, dense gas and dust of the early Solar System. Professor Jessica Barnes, from the University of Arizona, who is one of the study's authors, said: \"Our data suggest that Bennu's parent asteroid formed in the outer parts of the solar system, possibly beyond the orbit of Saturn.\" But the analysis also found a smorgasbord of other material in the sample, including organic matter from the outer Solar System and the interstellar medium - the gas and dust between stars - as well as high temperature materials that are thought to have formed close to the sun before drifting outwards.

The asteroid sample has proved to be an extraordinary window into the formation of the Solar System. Earlier this year, scientists announced it contained the building blocks of life. \"Studying Bennu has given us the opportunity to investigate a novel type of space rock, and we are learning new things about it every day,\" said Professor Russell. \"The lack of reaction with the Earth's atmosphere has given us the opportunity to study the history of the asteroid, and the evolution of the minerals it contains, in incomparable detail.\""

        "Content": "\n          Culture and entertainment reporter\n              @gemmapeplow\n  Actor Noel Clarke has lost his High Court libel case against the publisher of The Guardian, over a series of news articles which featured claims from a number of women. The first article, published in April 2021, said some 20 women who knew Clarke in a professional capacity had come forward with allegations of sexual misconduct. The 49-year-old actor, writer and director, best known for his 2006 film Kidulthood and starring in Doctor Who, sued the publisher and vehemently denied \"any sexual misconduct or wrongdoing\" - but the court has found Guardian News and Media (GNM) successfully defended the legal action on the grounds of truth and public interest. Read more:The key allegations against Noel Clarke - and the judge's response The meanings of all eight of the newspaper's publications were found to be \"substantially true\", the judge, Mrs Justice Steyn, said in a summary of the findings. \"I have accepted some of Mr Clarke's evidence... but overall I find that he was not a credible or reliable witness,\" she said. In her ruling, the judge also said suggestions that more than 20 witnesses, \"none of whom are parties or have a stake in this case, as [Clarke] does\" had come to court to lie was \"inherently implausible\". From the evidence heard, it was \"clear that women have been speaking about their experiences of working with Mr Clarke for many years\", she said. 'A deserved victory for women who suffered' Lucy Osborne and Sirin Kale, the journalists who carried out the investigation, told Sky News they had always been confident in everything published. \"I think that this is not a problem that's going to go away,\" said Osborne. \"This kind of behaviour very much still happens in the TV and film industry and other industries. So I do hope this judgment gives other women the confidence to speak out about what they've experienced.\" Read more: The key allegations - and judge's response Guardian editor-in-chief Katharine Viner described the ruling as \"a deserved victory for those women who suffered because of the behaviour of Noel Clarke\". She continued: \"Going to court is difficult and stressful, yet more than 20 women agreed to testify in the High Court, refusing to be bullied or intimidated. \"This is also a landmark judgment for Guardian journalism, and for investigative journalism in Britain... The judgment is clear that our investigation was thorough and fair, a template for public interest journalism.\" Clarke's response Clarke described the result as disappointing and maintained he believes the newspaper's reporting was \"inaccurate and damaging\". \"I have never claimed to be perfect,\" he said. \"But I am not the person described in these articles. Overnight I lost everything.\" He said he wanted to thank witnesses who supported his case, as well as his family, \"who never stopped believing there was something worth fighting for\". Arts and entertainment correspondent Noel Clarke isn't the first man working within the entertainment industry to fail to grasp that with power comes responsibility, and sadly I suspect he won’t be the last. As he licked his wounds following the judge's verdict, the foot-stamping also continued. \"I have never claimed to be perfect... but I am not the person described in these articles,\" he insisted. The judge disagreed. There is no workplace where unwanted kissing should be acceptable. For some reason, in TV and film the attitude that different rules apply has permeated for decades. Spoiler alert: they don't. It's inexcusable that anyone in a professional environment could be belittled or subjected to unwanted sexual advances or comments. The Guardian's win is a significant judgment for investigative journalism and the role a free press plays in bringing serious allegations into the public domain. And once again, while we all look at the one man, you also have to think about those who surrounded him who enjoyed the ride. Those who didn't challenge him. Those who were happy to piggy-back off of his popularity, who didn't pull him up. His ego, that sense of invincibility, wasn't an overnight thing. On shoots, his behaviour had clearly become normalised – somebody could, and should, have called it out. What happened during the trial? The trial took place from early March to early April 2025, hearing evidence from multiple witnesses who made accusations against Clarke, including that he had allegedly shared nude photographs of them without their consent, groped them, and asked them to look at him when he was exposed. Clarke also gave evidence over several days. At one stage, the actor appeared visibly emotional as he claimed the publisher had \"smashed my life\" with its investigation. His lawyer told the court he had been made a \"scapegoat\" and was an \"easy target\", as a star at the height of his success when the media industry \"zealously sought to correct itself\" following the #MeToo movement. The actor had been handed the outstanding British contribution to cinema award at the BAFTAs just a few weeks before the report was published. Following the article, BAFTA announced it had suspended his membership. But lawyers for The Guardian told how newspaper's investigation was \"careful and thorough\", saying it had been carried out \"conscientiously\" by the journalists involved. In March 2022, police said the actor would not face a criminal investigation over the allegations."

        "Content": "\n          Culture and entertainment reporter\n              @gemmapeplow\n Multiple witnesses gave evidence about their experiences of working with Noel Clarke during his libel trial - including women who had \"nothing to gain and everything to lose\", say the Guardian journalists who carried out the investigation. Before the newspaper published its report on allegations of inappropriate behaviour and sexual misconduct in 2021, Clarke was a huge success story in the UK film and TV industry - the acclaimed filmmaker behind Kidulthood, star of hit shows including Doctor Who and Bulletproof, and recipient of a BAFTA rising star award and another for his contribution to British cinema. Clarke denied any allegations of inappropriate behaviour or sexual misconduct, and in 2022 he sued the publishers of the newspaper for libel. Following a trial earlier this year, a High Court judge, Mrs Justice Steyn, has now dismissed his claim, finding the meaning of the newspaper's report and other subsequent articles it published was \"substantially true\". The trial heard evidence from multiple witnesses, including some women whose real names were not used. Their accusations against the actor and filmmaker included claims of inappropriate comments, sharing nude photographs without consent, and groping. Here are some of the key allegations - and the judge's response.  'Maya' An actress known as \"Maya\" worked on one production with Clarke and also auditioned for another, the judge said. She alleged she had been subject to comments and looks from Clarke, and felt pressured to be naked during a scene for a TV programme. Recording of a phone call between Clarke and the actress was heard in court, including conversation about this scene. \"It was an uncomfortable experience,\" Maya said in the call. \"We were rehearsing the romantic scene… I didn't say anything to you. I felt pressured to be naked from you in that scene.\" Clarke said in court that he believed she was \"acting\" on the call ahead of making allegations against him. In her ruling, Mrs Justice Steyn found Maya had been \"sexually harassed, pressured and touched\" by Clarke without her consent. \"It is apparent that he was insensitive to the discomfort he provoked,\" the judge said. \"But as is clear from his comments in the recorded phone call, and from the evidence generally, Mr Clarke would habitually, and lasciviously, look young, attractive women up and down.\" Floor runner One woman who worked as a floor runner said her experience of working with Clarke was \"extremely unpleasant\" and that he was \"rude and continuously belittling\" towards her from the outset, according to court documents. She said Clarke did not behave the same way towards another male runner and that she \"dreaded being alone\" with him as she would be \"routinely undermined\". She said she became \"extremely anxious\" and had her first panic attack during filming when \"Noel was ignoring my instructions and I couldn't carry out my job\", which she described as humiliating. The judge found she gave \"clear, honest and reliable evidence\", and added: \"She was a young woman, in a far subordinate role, who he singled out for this belittling and bullying treatment. It is probable that he acted in this way for no other reasons than that he had the power to do so, and he found it amusing.\" 'Penelope' One actress, known as \"Penelope\", said she worked on a sex scene with Clarke and that they discussed \"perhaps wearing patches or covers\", but Noel was \"insistent that he didn't think this would work and said he wanted to 'keep it natural'.\" In her witness statement, Penelope said she begged him to stop asking her to look at him while he was exposed and to allow others back into the room. She said she felt \"disgusted, shocked and frightened\", and concerned that he had \"created an impression to the crew that I was complicit in whatever was happening behind that closed door\". In her ruling, the judge said she found Penelope to be an honest witness and found it was not necessary for her to be naked from the waist down for the scene. She added: \"I have not found that the requirement for 'Penelope' to be naked below the waist for the filming of the sex scene was introduced for Mr Clarke's sexual gratification, but he did then take advantage of it for that purpose.\" 'Imogen' Clarke invited an actress known as \"Imogen\" to dinner in 2014, when she was 20, the trial heard. Imogen alleged he propositioned her for sex and offered to take photos, and also talked about going to brothels and tried to kiss her on the street after the meal. He looked \"furious\" when she avoided his kiss, she claimed. Her account was \"honest\", and save for a few minor points, \"it was also reliable and accurate\", the judge found. 'Mila' Another actress known as \"Mila\" described taking part in a scene that required nudity from the waist down. During the shoot, he also told her to bend over, asked her to sit on his lap, and made inappropriate sexual comments, she said. Again, the judge found she had \"no reason to lie\". While Clarke denied the allegations, the judge concluded The Guardian had, save for a couple of points, proved its case in respect of Mila. Gina Powell Gina Powell was part of Clarke's production company, Unstoppable, between 2014 and 2017. She alleges he groped her in a lift, exposed himself to her in a car, and brushed off concerns about his sexual behaviour towards other women. He also kept naked pictures of others, she claimed. Ms Powell told the court she had been through years of \"guilt\" watching how Clarke behaved with other women, which led to her speaking out. The judge found that on one occasion where Clarke pinched Ms Powell's bottom when they were being photographed, \"his intent was not sexual\", and it was \"intended as a friendly and jocular attempt to provoke a startled expression\". However, she also ruled that Ms Powell was \"an honest, reliable\" witness and accepted the filmmaker had shown her nude photographs, as well as her evidence on what happened in the car and lift. 'Ivy' One woman, known only as \"Ivy\", said in a witness statement that she had had a brief relationship with Clarke, while he was married, and alleged she later discovered he had shared nude photographs of her without her consent. Ivy said she was \"horrified\" to discover later that the private images had been shown to others. \"Trusting him, I consensually sent him a small number of nude photos of myself,\" she said. \"I expressly told him that he should not show them to anyone... I believed that he would respect that.\" The court heard evidence from others who corroborated her account. The judge, in her ruling, found The Guardian had established Clarke \"revealed naked photographs\" of Ivy without her consent and shared them with others. Jing Lusi Actress Jing Lusi, known for films including Crazy Rich Asians and series including Gangs Of London and Red Eye, worked with Clarke on the film SAS: Red Notice, which was filmed in Budapest in 2018. She said that during a dinner, he suggested to her that they could do a read-through of the script in his \"bed\" or \"bedroom\". He also told her he had \"fantasised\" about her and described what he wanted to do to her, in a separate incident, she alleged. She said this left her feeling \"disgusted\". Clarke denied her allegations. In her ruling, Mrs Justice Steyn said that while she accepted Ms Lusi's account, she did find that in circumstances where Clarke's behaviour towards her was not an abuse of power, \"the events described did not assist the Guardian in establishing the truth defence\"."

The LA force said that as officers went to the 11000 block of Ventura Boulevard in Studio City, the man rushed towards them. \"He was transported to a local hospital for a possible overdose and placed under arrest for battery on a police officer,\" police said. A law enforcement source confirmed to NBC News that the suspect was Montero Lamar Hill, also known as Lil Nas X. The Old Town Road rapper punched an officer twice in the face during the encounter, according to the NBC source.
