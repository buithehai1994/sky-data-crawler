        "Content": " Vladimir Putin made demands to take control of key regions of Ukraine during his talks with Donald Trump, it has been widely reported, as a condition for ending the war. During their summit in Alaska, the Russian leader is said to have told the US president he wants the eastern Donetsk and Luhansk regions - and would give up other Ukrainian territories held by his troops in exchange. The plans were reported by several news outlets, citing sources close to the matter, as Mr Trump scheduled a further meeting with Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy in Washington DC for Monday. He has said this could potentially pave the way for a three-way meeting with Mr Putin. Mr Trump reportedly backs the plans, according to some outlets - but Mr Zelenskyy has previously ruled out formally handing any territory to Moscow. Russia already controls a fifth of Ukraine, including about three-quarters of Donetsk province, which it first entered in 2014. US-Russia talks on Ukraine - latest updates Details of the plans emerged after little was revealed during the high-profile summit between the US and Russian leaders on Friday. Despite threats by the US president beforehand, of sanctions for Russia should there be no agreement on a ceasefire, a short news briefing after the talks ended with no mention of a suspension of fighting, no announced agreement on how to end the war, and little clarity about the next steps. On Saturday, Mr Trump appeared to change his stance on what he hopes to achieve in Ukraine, indicating he wants a permanent peace settlement rather than a ceasefire. \"It was determined by all that the best way to end the horrific war between Russia and Ukraine is to go directly to a Peace Agreement, which would end the war, and not a mere Ceasefire Agreement, which often times do not hold up,\" he said in a post on his social network site, Truth Social. Trump: 'Russia is a big power - they're not' In an interview with Fox News following the summit, Mr Trump signalled he and Putin had discussed land transfers and security guarantees for Ukraine, and had \"largely agreed\". He said Ukraine has to made a deal, as \"Russia is a very big power, and they're not\". Monday's meeting at the White House will be the Ukrainian president's second this year. His last descended into a fiery spat with Mr Trump and his vice president JD Vance, which saw him leave early. After the fresh meeting was announced, Mr Zelenskyy in a post on X that he was grateful for the invitation.

However, he said Russia had rebuffed \"numerous calls for a ceasefire and has not yet determined when it will stop the killing\", which \"complicates the situation\". Mr Zelenskyy continued: \"If they lack the will to carry out a simple order to stop the strikes, it may take a lot of effort to get Russia to have the will to implement far greater - peaceful coexistence with its neighbours for decades. \"But together we are working for peace and security. Stopping the killing is a key element of stopping the war.\"  Putin releases statement on summit In a statement on the summit, Mr Putin described the talks as \"timely and quite useful\" - but said the \"removal\" of what he calls the \"root causes\" of the crisis \"must underlie the settlement\". He continued: \"We definitely respect the US administration's position which wants the hostilities to stop as soon as possible. So do we, and we would like to move forward with settling all issues by peaceful means. \"The conversation was very frank and substantive, which, in my view, moves us closer towards making necessary decisions.\" European leaders who make up the \"coalition of the willing\" are set to hold a conference call today ahead of the crunch talks between Mr Trump and Mr Zelenskyy. Prime Minister Keir Starmer, French President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Friedrich Merz will host the video conference.

He said he supported the next phase of talks, but added: \"In the meantime, until (Putin) stops his barbaric assault, we will keep tightening the screws on his war machine with even more sanctions.\" Meanwhile, Ukraine's military has reported an advance of up to 2km on the Sumy front in the country's northeast. \"Zones of continuous enemy fire damage are being maintained,\" the Ukrainian General Staff said on Telegram. \"Ukrainian troops are repelling Russian forces\". In the early hours of Sunday, a regional governor in Russia said a railway employee had been injured and a power line damaged by a Ukrainian drone attack. The incident happened in the Voronezh region, Alexander Gusev said on Telegram."

The coalition - co-chaired by Sir Keir Starmer, France's President Emmanuel Macron and Germany's Chancellor Friedrich Merz - has the aim of bringing countries together to protect a peace deal in Ukraine. Top of the agenda at Sunday's meeting will be securing a concrete commitment from Mr Trump on a security guarantee that would act as a powerful backstop in any Russia-Ukraine peacekeeping arrangement. Ukraine war latest: Putin comments on Trump talks European leaders seemed buoyed by the US president's most recent hints on the subject, in the knowledge that US military might is likely to deter Vladimir Putin from advancing in the future. They will also discuss how to bring Mr Zelenskyy into talks after Mr Trump and Mr Putin's Alaska meeting saw him left out in the cold. In coordinated statements, European leaders said Mr Zelenskyy must play a greater role in future talks, and that peace cannot be achieved without him. The hard bit will be to persuade the unpredictable US administration to change its approach, something that has proved almost impossible in the past.  When Mr Trump re-entered the White House and made it clear the US would no longer provide a blank cheque to protect peace in Europe, others decided they had to step up, and the 'coalition of the willing' was thrown together in March. Since then, information about the allied peacekeeping effort has been patchy, but we know it includes over 30 countries, which have been asked to pledge whatever military support they can, including troops.

        "Content": "\n          International correspondent\n              @DiMagnaySky\n  In the Al-Rantisi hospital in Gaza City, nine-year-old Maryam Dawas is wasting away. WARNING: This shows people suffering from malnutrition which you may find distressing Her malnutrition is so severe, she can no longer eat. Her tiny ribcage juts out of her chest. Her upper arms are thinner than her wrists. Every blink looks like it's a struggle. Her eyes are tired and sad. \"What is your dream now?\" a family friend who's filming asks her. \"To go back to the way I was,\" she whispers back. Maryam Dawas used to weigh 25kg (3st 9lb). Now she weighs nine (1st 4lb). That's about the weight of a baby that hasn't yet reached its first birthday. \"Maryam suffered from malnutrition ever since we were displaced from the north to Rafah,\" her mother explains. \"Because of the famine that was in the south, we went through a famine, but it wasn't worse than the one we are in now.\" Maryam's case is hardly unique. The latest report on Gaza from the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) says that almost 13,000 new admissions of children for acute malnutrition were recorded in July. The latest numbers from the Gaza Health Ministry are 251 dead as a result of famine and malnutrition, including 108 children. Read moreGaza's deadliest day in a week claims 100 livesMadonna urges the Pope to go to GazaFuneral for Al Jazeera journalists killed in strike \"I went to multiple hospitals in the last week and every one of them is overwhelmed with malnutrition cases, severe malnutrition - children, teenagers, you name it,\" OCHA Gaza representative Olga Cherevko tells me. \"And whether it's a pre-existing condition or malnutrition on its own, the fact that it's in the state that it is means that it exacerbates whatever condition exists on top of it.\" Israel's coordinator of government activities in the territories (COGAT) claimed on Tuesday that Hamas was inflating the numbers of people in Gaza dying of malnutrition, and that most of the children who had died had pre-existing health conditions. But that is the thing about famine. It seeks out the vulnerable first and then it settles in, ingraining itself with the weak and the poverty-stricken, exacerbating their problems. In his book Poverty and Famines, the Nobel prize-winning economist Amartya Sen writes as his opening line: \"Starvation is the characteristic of some people not having enough food to eat. It is not the characteristic of there not being enough food to eat.\"  Aid not getting to the most weak and vulnerable There is now a trickle of aid getting into Gaza, but it is getting to those who are strong enough to fight for it. Siphoned off from aid points and sold on the black market, it is getting to the few who still have some money to pay for it. It is not getting to the weak, the vulnerable and the poor, though that describes the majority of Gaza's 2.1 million residents. According to the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (ICE) which measures food insecurity and famine, 81% of households in Gaza reported poor food consumption in July, up from 33% in April; 24% of households experienced very severe hunger in July, compared with 4% in April; and nearly nine out of 10 households resorted to \"extremely severe coping mechanisms\" to feed themselves. That huge hike in food insecurity follows on directly from Israel's total blockade, which began on 2 March and ended on 19 May when Israel began a limited resumption of food supplies. Eleven weeks in which nothing at all came in, compounding almost two years of war and a partial blockade of Gaza ongoing since 2007. The UK says it plans to evacuate more injured and critically ill children from Gaza \"at pace\". For children like Maryam, that could not happen soon enough."

        "Content": "A hurricane making its way across the Caribbean Sea has quickly turned into a Category 5 storm, having rapidly strengthened in just 24 hours.  Hurricane Erin - the first of the 2025 Atlantic season - has raced from maximum sustained winds of 100mph (160kph) to 160mph (255kph). It gained power as it began moving westward past the Leeward Islands - which include Anguilla, Guadaloupe, and the Virgin Islands - on Saturday. While the hurricane is not forecast to make landfall, it is expected to \"produce life-threatening surf and rip currents\" as it turns northward next week, the US National Hurricane Centre said. Beaches in the Bahamas, much of the east coast of the United States and even Atlantic Canada will be affected, it added. Protruding US coastal areas - such as Long Island, New York and Cape Cod - face a higher risk of direct and potentially severe tropical storm or hurricane conditions, AccuWeather said.  The hurricane's impact is already being felt on multiple islands. Tropical storm watches have been issued for some Caribbean islands, including St Barts and St Maarten. The National Hurricane Centre (NHC) has warned heavy rain could cause flash flooding, landslides and mudslides, saying Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands could be affected on Sunday. The US government deployed more than 200 workers, including employees from the Federal Emergency Management Agency, to Puerto Rico as a precaution when a flood watch for the territory was issued earlier this week. With hurricane-force winds extending 30 miles from its centre, Erin is considered compact in size. It should begin to slowly weaken on Monday but will remain a major hurricane until late next week, the NHC said. Storms that ramp up so quickly complicate forecasting and make it harder for government agencies to plan for emergencies. Scientists have linked the rapid intensification of hurricanes in the Atlantic Ocean to climate change, as global warming is causing the atmosphere to hold more water vapour and spiking ocean temperatures. The warmer waters give hurricanes fuel to strengthen quickly and unleash more rain. Erin is the fifth named storm of the Atlantic hurricane season, which began on 1 June and runs until 30 November. It is the first to become a hurricane."

        "Content": "\n          News correspondent\n              @esadiya\n  Fashion brand Topshop celebrated its relaunch with its first catwalk in seven years. The company's website promised everyone was invited as models strutted down a runway on Trafalgar Square in front of noughties fashion icons Cara Delevingne and Adwoa Aboah and the London Mayor Sir Sadiq Khan. The label has been operating on the online fashion platform ASOS after ceasing to operate as a standalone business in 2020. Its previous owner, Sir Philip Green's Arcadia group, collapsed into administration and all of Topshop's physical stores - including the Oxford Circus flagship in London's West End - closed soon after. Delevingne told Sky News she was \"totally blown away\" by the relaunch event. \"It was like nostalgia mixed with something eclectic but also something brand new,\" she said. \"For me, it really brings back a time of exploration of my own fashion sense because I think for me at Topshop I got to discover so much.\" The model, who is working on a capsule collection for next year, has already unveiled a choice edit in this year's show and said her relationship with Topshop precedes her fame. She said: \"I would go in and my friends would be like 'you would look good in that' and I would go 'no, that's not really me', and then you'd try it on and be like 'oh maybe I can explore more'. \"They really have everything for everyone, and I feel like they brought that back.\" The runway showcased highlights from its Autumn-Winter 2025 collection, as well as an early preview of pieces set to drop later this season, including showstopper gowns, the classic white tee, and an aloe vera-coloured faux fur coat that surely should not have been on display - to prevent just about everyone rushing to buy it. Reclaiming the high street But sharp tailoring and statement outerwear suggest the brand is ready to reclaim the high street. Must-have denim pieces completed the womenswear line-up while the Topman collection screamed modern utility by blending refined formal wear with sharp new silhouettes. Casual pieces are grounded by authentic denim in deep indigos, which stood out on Trafalgar Square's magnificent stone steps. Topshop's relaunch comes as the high street continues to struggle and as the UK operation of Chinese fashion giant Shein announced pre-tax profits of £38.3m for the year, up some £14m from 2023. 'Top end of the market' Moses Rashid, global marketing director at Topshop/Topman said they are competing in a different space. \"We're at the top end of the market. We're about elevation. We pride ourselves on the quality of the product,\" he said. Those products are being designed in north London, and managing director Michelle Wilson said the aim is to stay that way. \"We are a British brand, we want to be a positive force for fashion. We want to bring London to the world. It's fundamental to who we are as a brand, our style is very much London-driven.\" The majority Danish-owned company has suggested it will slow fashion down by opening physical stores where customers can touch the products, browse collections and try things on, though the flagship on Oxford Circus is unlikely to return because a Swedish fast furniture brand has since occupied the space. Designer Wayne Hemingway has previously collaborated with Topshop and said the relaunch must be more than nostalgia.

        "Content": "Smoke from wildfires in Spain and Portugal has brought hazy conditions to the UK, breaking up last week's spell of very hot weather, forecasters have said. In a post on the X social media platform on Saturday, the Met Office said: \"Smoke from wildfires in Spain and Portugal, plus Saharan dust, has drifted over the UK.\" The Met Office said the UK should expect \"enhanced sunsets and sunrises in the coming days - deeper reds & oranges thanks to light scattering.\" The latest forecast where you are Sky weather producer Kirsty McCabe said \"the very hot weather is easing, thanks to a strengthening easterly wind as well as cloudier skies\". She said Saturday's haze is down to \"the terrible wildfires that have been raging across Spain and Portugal, and the smoke has made its way to our shores, along with some Saharan dust\". While the smoke particles shouldn't affect the UK's air quality, she said they will \"enhance the orange and red colours of our sunsets and sunrises\". Wildfire smoke affects the colour of the sky through processes known as Rayleigh scattering and Mie scattering, she explained. On reaching the Earth's atmosphere, the sun's light bumps into tiny molecules of nitrogen and oxygen, which scatter or deflect the light. Kirsty McCabe said Mie scattering occurs \"when the [smoke] particles are much larger and closer to the wavelengths of light. \"That means the smoke particles in the air scatter all colours of light more equally, leading to a hazy or milky appearance of the sun and sky.\" Rayleigh scattering sees the shorter wavelengths of light, blues and violets, scattered most strongly, while red light, having the longest wavelength, is scattered the least, she explained. \"At dusk and dawn, the sun's rays travel through a greater distance of atmosphere to reach our eyes, so the blue light has been scattered even more. \"With most of the shorter blue and violet wavelengths filtered out, along with some green and yellow, that leaves us with the warmer hues of the reds and oranges.\" Met Office meteorologist Greg Dewhurst said the haze \"will hang around for the next few days\". He predicted temperatures in the mid to high twenties, rising to 28C in some parts, with hazy sunshine moving from southwest England into Wales and Northern Ireland.

        "Content": "\n          West of England and Wales correspondent\n              @danwnews\n  In a small hut next to Newlyn Harbour at the bottom of Cornwall, the next generation of fishermen are quite literally learning the ropes. Around a dozen students are on the eighth day of a two-week intensive course to become commercial fishers. From knot and ropework to chart plotting, navigation to sea survival, by the end of the course they'll be qualified to take a berth on a vessel. While many are following in the footsteps of their fathers, others are here to try an entirely different career. Elliot Fairbairn, 28, is originally from London and has been working as a groundworker. \"I'm not from a fishing family - I just like a challenge,\" he says. He's put his current job on hold to see how fishing works out. \n                  Man charged with murder of 93-year-old woman in Bude, Cornwall\n                 \n                  Man, 65, arrested on suspicion of murdering 93-year-old woman in Cornwall\n                 \n                  The communities fighting green energy infrastructure in Devon and Wales\n                 \"It makes you feel good doing a hard job. I think that's what's getting lost these days, people want an easy job, easy money and they don't understand what it takes to be successful. Sometimes you've got to put that in the work.\" Elliot already has a job lined up for next week on a ring-netter boat. \"I'm ecstatic - I'm very pumped!\" he tells me. Also on the course is 17-year-old Oscar Ashby. He's doing his A-Levels at Truro College and training to be a healthcare worker at the main hospital in Cornwall. \"I'm part of the staff bank so can work whatever hours I want - which would fit quite well if I wanted to do a week's fishing,\" he says. It's his love of being outside that has drawn him to get qualified. \"It's hands-on, it's not a bad way to make money. It's one of the last jobs that is like being a hunter-gatherer really - everything else is really industrialised, \" Oscar says. The course was over-subscribed. The charity that runs it - Seafood Cornwall Training - could only offer places to half those who applied. 'A foot in the door' \"The range of knowledge they're gathering is everything from how to tie a few knots all the way on how to register with HMRC to pay and manage their tax because they'd be self-employed fishermen,\" manager Clare Leverton tells me. \"What we're trying to do with this course is give them a foot in the door. \"By meeting our tutors, skippers on the quay, vessel managers, they start to understand who they're going to have to talk to to get jobs.\" Getting fresh blood into the industry is vital. Over the last 30 years, the number of fishermen in the UK has nearly halved - from around 20,000 to 10,000. The average age of a fisherman in the UK is 55. Aging workforce \"I think we're seeing the effects of having an aging workforce,\" says Mike Cohen, chief executive of the National Federation of Fishermen's Organisations (NFFO). \"Fishing is a traditional occupation in most places around the country. A lot of family businesses, and as people are getting older, they're starting to retire out of the industry.\" The decline comes at a time of frustration and anger in the industry too. Many feel the prime minister's post-Brexit deal with the EU back in May sold fishing out by guaranteeing another 12 years of access to EU boats to fish in UK waters, rather than allowing it to be negotiated annually. \"A large part of the effort the EU exerts in UK waters is within our territorial waters, so within 12 miles of the shore. And that's the area that's most pressured,\" adds Mr Cohen. \"For new people getting into the industry it's the area that they can reach in the sort of small boats that new starters tend to work in. They're increasingly pressured in that space and by keeping all of those European boats having access to it for free, for nothing, that puts them under even more pressure.\" The government says it will always back \"our great British fishing industry\" and insists the EU deal protects Britain's fishing access.

        "Content": "\n          Sports correspondent\n              @RobHarris\n The publishing industry has warned that books created by artificial intelligence - often imitating autobiographies - are a growing concern, and called on retailers to issue clearer warnings to consumers. Sky News has spent months tracking apparent AI recreations, particularly sports books, that have been sold on Amazon as Kindle e-books, as well as printed versions. Some titles were removed after we informed the e-commerce giant. But we understand there are no immediate plans for Amazon to label content that AI was involved in generating. \"AI created books are an increasing problem for us,\" Publishers Association chief executive Dan Conway told Sky News. \"It is incredibly easy using these new, amazing tools to create content. \"The problem is that on the consumer side, it's really, really difficult to tell the difference often between a properly researched book that covers a topic that you want to read about versus something that's been spun up incredibly quickly using AI technology. And you've got some real consumer confusion out there.\" In recent days, we found several books quickly feeding off England's success at the Women's Euros, which appeared to be created by AI. Books on scoring stars Chloe Kelly and Michelle Agyemang shared the same style covers, even featuring the wrong ball - from American football. Fewer than 50 pages each, they sell in paperback for about £11. The Agyemang book was published the day after her dramatic equaliser in the Euros semifinal against Italy, while the Kelly book appeared online the day after her winning penalty in the final against Spain. The named author, who has no digital trail beyond Amazon and other online retailers, has more than 45 books to their name since the start of July, on politicians, scientists, entrepreneurs and musicians, as well as sports stars. It is frustrating for sports stars telling heartfelt stories in books only to see imitations online, confusing consumers. 'It's scary' At the recent Sports Book Awards, former England football captain Steph Houghton was shocked to be told about a 50-page imitation of her autobiography, Leading From The Back, which runs for more than 300 pages. \"It takes a lot of hard work to make a book,\" she said. \"It's poor that, in terms of Amazon allowing it to be on there as well.\" Former Liverpool and Tottenham player Neil Ruddock was in disbelief about a book aping Toxic, his account of addiction, Toxic. His literary agent, James Wills, said: \"We do have a real concern about generative AI, which is what this is, somebody putting it in and using it that way.\" Former Afghanistan football captain Khalida Popal produced My Beautiful Sisters, a harrowing account of sexual abuse in her team and helping players flee the Taliban. She was stunned to be shown a similar account of her life had been produced and placed on sale online. \"It's scary,\" the award winner told Sky News. \"This story matters a lot. It's the voices and the stories of hundreds and thousands of women who suffered and who are victims and survivors of brutality and war, and challenges in Afghanistan. \"Those sisters, those voices and stories, are very important for me. That's why I really took care of it, telling that story.\" Those AI versions of the Popal, Ruddock and Houghton books are no longer available on Amazon but they were for some time without it being obvious how they could have been created. What is Amazon doing? An Amazon spokesperson told Sky News: \"We have content guidelines governing which books can be listed for sale, and we have proactive and reactive methods that help us detect content that violates our guidelines, whether AI-generated or not. \"We invest significant time and resources to ensure our guidelines are followed, and remove books that do not adhere to those guidelines. \"We aim to provide the best possible shopping, reading, and publishing experience, and we are constantly evaluating developments that impact that experience, which includes the rapid evolution and expansion of generative AI tools. \"We continue to enhance our protections against non-compliant content, and our process and guidelines will keep evolving as we see changes in publishing.\" Read more:Cara Delevingne on Topshop inspirationNHS to use AI tech to free hospital beds People releasing books via Kindle Direct Publishing (KDP) are required to inform Amazon if content is AI-generated, but that information is not passed on to consumers. KDP authors can be asked by Amazon to verify their identities. Unofficial biographies are a staple of the publishing industry, often written by journalists on celebrities and politicians, but involving their own research and writing. The growing concern is the limited human involvement in putting together books - without it being clear to those browsing online platforms and searching for books to buy. Those churning out AI books are often rapidly reacting to news, such as the election of Pope Leo in May, when few could have been prepared to write at such length about him. The Publishers Association is discussing the framework for AI with the government. \"These large language models that exist now are so powerful that it's become incredibly easy to create content of all types,\" Mr Conway said. \"You've effectively got the threat of information saturation. \"So a cookbook comes out on a topic and is particularly well-received. You can have, within days, thousands of other titles that are spun up that then compete directly with that product.\""

        "Content": "Artificial Intelligence (AI) technology is being piloted to help free up NHS hospital beds being used by people who are fit to be sent home, officials have said. A new platform, currently being trialled by Chelsea and Westminster NHS Trust, uses AI to help fill out the documents needed to discharge a patient - potentially saving hours of delays. The tool extracts information such as diagnoses and test results from medical records, helping staff to draft discharge summaries, which must be completed before a person is sent home from the hospital. The document is then reviewed by healthcare professionals responsible for the patient and used to send them home or refer them to other services. Health Secretary Wes Streeting has said the technology will allow doctors to spend less time on paperwork and more time on patient care, cutting waiting times in the process. The tool will be hosted on the NHS Federated Data Platform (FDP), a shared software system designed to make it easier for health and care organisations to work together and provide better services. The current manual system can leave patients waiting for hours to be discharged as doctors may be too busy to fill in forms, according to the Department for Science, Innovation and Technology. Mr Streeting said: \"This potentially transformational discharge tool is a prime example of how we're shifting from analogue to digital as part of our 10-year health plan. \"We're using cutting-edge technology to build an NHS fit for the future and tackle the hospital backlogs that have left too many people waiting too long.\" 👉Listen to Politics at Sam and Anne's on your podcast app👈    The platform is one of a number of projects backed by Sir Keir Starmer, who in January said that AI would be used to \"turn around\" the economy and public services. In May, the government announced it was rolling out an AI tool to test public feeling on different issues, which it said could save around £20m in staffing. It has also been announced that technology shown to halve the time probation officers spend organising notes will be rolled out nationwide this year."

        "Content": "A man has been arrested on suspicion of racially abusing a Bournemouth player during the first Premier League match of the season. Antoine Semenyo had accused a spectator of making unacceptable remarks during the 29th minute of the game against Liverpool - and a man was later ejected from Anfield. Merseyside Police has now confirmed that a 47-year-old man from Liverpool is being held on suspicion of a racially aggravated public order offence. He has been taken into custody to be questioned. On X, the winger - who scored two goals during the match - said the messages he has received were \"overwhelming\", and a reminder of why he loves the sport. Semenyo wrote: \"Last night at Anfield will stay with me forever - not because of one person's words, but because of how the entire football family stood together. \"To my Bournemouth teammates who supported me in that moment, to the Liverpool players and fans who showed their true character, to the Premier League officials who handled it professionally - thank you. \n                  Newcastle United report 'appalling' racist abuse aimed at Joe Willock to police after 2-1 loss to Fulham\n                 \n                  Gavin Dunn banned from attending football matches after racially abusing Bournemouth striker Justin Kluivert\n                 \n                  Tamworth FC striker 'not surprised' to receive vile racist message after Tottenham FA Cup match\n                 \"Football showed its best side when it mattered most ... we keep moving forward, together.\" Following the incident, an anti-discrimination message was read out to the crowd, and it is understood that police officers went into the referee's room at half-time. Merseyside Police said a 47-year-old man was removed from the ground and an investigation was underway after his identity was confirmed. Chief Inspector Kev Chatterton, the match commander for the game, said: \"Merseyside Police will not tolerate hate crime of any form. \"We take incidents like this very seriously, and in cases like this we will be proactively seeking football banning orders, with the club, against those responsible.\" He added: \"There is no place for racism and it is vital that anyone who witnesses such an offence reports it to stewards, or the police immediately.\" A spokesperson for Liverpool said: \"We condemn racism and discrimination in all forms, it has no place in society, or football.\" Semenyo scored twice in the second half to help bring Bournemouth back from two goals down at Anfield before Liverpool went on to eventually win the contest 4-2. Bournemouth captain Adam Smith told Sky Sports News afterwards: \"It shouldn't be happening. I don't know how Ant's played on to be honest and come up with those goals. It's totally unacceptable. \"Something needs to be done. Taking the knee isn't having an effect. We're supporting him and hopefully he'll be okay. \"I wanted him to react because that's what I would have done, but this shows what type of man he is ... to come up with those goals showed the type of guy he is. \"To be fair the Liverpool players were very supportive as well towards Antoine and the rest of the team. It was handled in the right way but ... so angry. \"I don't know what else we can do. No one's getting it. I don't know what to say anymore. I just feel for Ant ... shocking.\" Read more from Sky News:Thousands more Afghans affected by second data breach - ministerSonic boom heard after fighter jets scrambled to intercept passenger jet The Premier League said in a statement that its \"on-field anti-discrimination protocol\" had been followed and the incident \"will now be fully investigated\". \"We offer our full support to the player and both clubs,\" it added. \"Racism has no place in our game, or anywhere in society. We will continue to work with stakeholders and authorities to ensure our stadiums are an inclusive and welcoming environment for all.\" The Football Association said it was \"concerned\" about the allegation of racism towards Semenyo and that it would ensure \"appropriate action\" would be taken. The incident comes two days after Tottenham Hotspur player Mathys Tel faced racist abuse online following a missed penalty in his team's UEFA Super Cup loss to Paris Saint-Germain."

        "Content": "\n          West of England and Wales correspondent\n              @danwnews\n  In a small hut next to Newlyn Harbour at the bottom of Cornwall, the next generation of fishermen are quite literally learning the ropes. Around a dozen students are on the eighth day of a two-week intensive course to become commercial fishers. From knot and ropework to chart plotting, navigation to sea survival, by the end of the course they'll be qualified to take a berth on a vessel. While many are following in the footsteps of their fathers, others are here to try an entirely different career. Elliot Fairbairn, 28, is originally from London and has been working as a groundworker. \"I'm not from a fishing family - I just like a challenge,\" he says. He's put his current job on hold to see how fishing works out. \n                  Man charged with murder of 93-year-old woman in Bude, Cornwall\n                 \n                  Man, 65, arrested on suspicion of murdering 93-year-old woman in Cornwall\n                 \n                  The communities fighting green energy infrastructure in Devon and Wales\n                 \"It makes you feel good doing a hard job. I think that's what's getting lost these days, people want an easy job, easy money and they don't understand what it takes to be successful. Sometimes you've got to put that in the work.\" Elliot already has a job lined up for next week on a ring-netter boat. \"I'm ecstatic - I'm very pumped!\" he tells me. Also on the course is 17-year-old Oscar Ashby. He's doing his A-Levels at Truro College and training to be a healthcare worker at the main hospital in Cornwall. \"I'm part of the staff bank so can work whatever hours I want - which would fit quite well if I wanted to do a week's fishing,\" he says. It's his love of being outside that has drawn him to get qualified. \"It's hands-on, it's not a bad way to make money. It's one of the last jobs that is like being a hunter-gatherer really - everything else is really industrialised, \" Oscar says. The course was over-subscribed. The charity that runs it - Seafood Cornwall Training - could only offer places to half those who applied. 'A foot in the door' \"The range of knowledge they're gathering is everything from how to tie a few knots all the way on how to register with HMRC to pay and manage their tax because they'd be self-employed fishermen,\" manager Clare Leverton tells me. \"What we're trying to do with this course is give them a foot in the door. \"By meeting our tutors, skippers on the quay, vessel managers, they start to understand who they're going to have to talk to to get jobs.\" Getting fresh blood into the industry is vital. Over the last 30 years, the number of fishermen in the UK has nearly halved - from around 20,000 to 10,000. The average age of a fisherman in the UK is 55. Aging workforce \"I think we're seeing the effects of having an aging workforce,\" says Mike Cohen, chief executive of the National Federation of Fishermen's Organisations (NFFO). \"Fishing is a traditional occupation in most places around the country. A lot of family businesses, and as people are getting older, they're starting to retire out of the industry.\" The decline comes at a time of frustration and anger in the industry too. Many feel the prime minister's post-Brexit deal with the EU back in May sold fishing out by guaranteeing another 12 years of access to EU boats to fish in UK waters, rather than allowing it to be negotiated annually. \"A large part of the effort the EU exerts in UK waters is within our territorial waters, so within 12 miles of the shore. And that's the area that's most pressured,\" adds Mr Cohen. \"For new people getting into the industry it's the area that they can reach in the sort of small boats that new starters tend to work in. They're increasingly pressured in that space and by keeping all of those European boats having access to it for free, for nothing, that puts them under even more pressure.\" The government says it will always back \"our great British fishing industry\" and insists the EU deal protects Britain's fishing access. 'A brilliant career' To further promote getting young people into commercial fishing, the Cornwall Fish Producers Organisation has helped set up the Young Fishermen Network. Skipper Tom Lambourne, 29, helped set up the group. \"There's not enough young people coming into it and getting involved in it,\" he says. \"It's actually a brilliant career. It's a hard career - you do have to sacrifice a lot to get a lot out of fishing - your time is one of them. But the pros of that certainly outweigh it and it's a really good job.\" Tom says the network supports new fishers by holding social events and helping them find jobs: \"There's never been a collective for young fishermen. \"For a youngster getting into the fishing industry to be sort of part of that - knowing there's other youngsters coming in in the same position - they can chat to one another, it's pretty cool really.\" Read more from Sky News:Arrest after footballer 'racially abused'European wildfires' impact on UK weatherSecond Afghan data breach confirmedSonic boom after fighter jets scrambled In 2021, UK fishing contributed around 0.03% to GDP - with an economic output of £483m.

She said Saturday's haze is down to \"the terrible wildfires that have been raging across Spain and Portugal, and the smoke has made its way to our shores, along with some Saharan dust\". While the smoke particles shouldn't affect the UK's air quality, she said they will \"enhance the orange and red colours of our sunsets and sunrises\". Wildfire smoke affects the colour of the sky through processes known as Rayleigh scattering and Mie scattering, she explained. On reaching the Earth's atmosphere, the sun's light bumps into tiny molecules of nitrogen and oxygen, which scatter or deflect the light. Kirsty McCabe said Mie scattering occurs \"when the [smoke] particles are much larger and closer to the wavelengths of light. \"That means the smoke particles in the air scatter all colours of light more equally, leading to a hazy or milky appearance of the sun and sky.\" Rayleigh scattering sees the shorter wavelengths of light, blues and violets, scattered most strongly, while red light, having the longest wavelength, is scattered the least, she explained. \"At dusk and dawn, the sun's rays travel through a greater distance of atmosphere to reach our eyes, so the blue light has been scattered even more. \"With most of the shorter blue and violet wavelengths filtered out, along with some green and yellow, that leaves us with the warmer hues of the reds and oranges.\" Met Office meteorologist Greg Dewhurst said the haze \"will hang around for the next few days\". He predicted temperatures in the mid to high twenties, rising to 28C in some parts, with hazy sunshine moving from southwest England into Wales and Northern Ireland.

An area the size of London has been destroyed by wildfires so far this year, with western Spain especially badly affected. Southern Europe is having one of the worst summers for wildfires in 20 years, with France, Greece, Turkey and Albania among the countries affected. While Southern Europe lived through wildfires, droughts and heatwaves long before humans started to change the climate by burning fossil fuels, hotter global temperatures can supercharge some of the conditions for these types of extreme weather, according to climate scientists."

        "Content": "\n          Sports correspondent\n              @RobHarris\n The publishing industry has warned that books created by artificial intelligence - often imitating autobiographies - are a growing concern, and called on retailers to issue clearer warnings to consumers. Sky News has spent months tracking apparent AI recreations, particularly sports books, that have been sold on Amazon as Kindle e-books, as well as printed versions. Some titles were removed after we informed the e-commerce giant. But we understand there are no immediate plans for Amazon to label content that AI was involved in generating. \"AI created books are an increasing problem for us,\" Publishers Association chief executive Dan Conway told Sky News. \"It is incredibly easy using these new, amazing tools to create content. \"The problem is that on the consumer side, it's really, really difficult to tell the difference often between a properly researched book that covers a topic that you want to read about versus something that's been spun up incredibly quickly using AI technology. And you've got some real consumer confusion out there.\" In recent days, we found several books quickly feeding off England's success at the Women's Euros, which appeared to be created by AI. Books on scoring stars Chloe Kelly and Michelle Agyemang shared the same style covers, even featuring the wrong ball - from American football. Fewer than 50 pages each, they sell in paperback for about £11. The Agyemang book was published the day after her dramatic equaliser in the Euros semifinal against Italy, while the Kelly book appeared online the day after her winning penalty in the final against Spain. The named author, who has no digital trail beyond Amazon and other online retailers, has more than 45 books to their name since the start of July, on politicians, scientists, entrepreneurs and musicians, as well as sports stars. It is frustrating for sports stars telling heartfelt stories in books only to see imitations online, confusing consumers. 'It's scary' At the recent Sports Book Awards, former England football captain Steph Houghton was shocked to be told about a 50-page imitation of her autobiography, Leading From The Back, which runs for more than 300 pages. \"It takes a lot of hard work to make a book,\" she said. \"It's poor that, in terms of Amazon allowing it to be on there as well.\" Former Liverpool and Tottenham player Neil Ruddock was in disbelief about a book aping Toxic, his account of addiction, Toxic. His literary agent, James Wills, said: \"We do have a real concern about generative AI, which is what this is, somebody putting it in and using it that way.\" Former Afghanistan football captain Khalida Popal produced My Beautiful Sisters, a harrowing account of sexual abuse in her team and helping players flee the Taliban. She was stunned to be shown a similar account of her life had been produced and placed on sale online. \"It's scary,\" the award winner told Sky News. \"This story matters a lot. It's the voices and the stories of hundreds and thousands of women who suffered and who are victims and survivors of brutality and war, and challenges in Afghanistan. \"Those sisters, those voices and stories, are very important for me. That's why I really took care of it, telling that story.\" Those AI versions of the Popal, Ruddock and Houghton books are no longer available on Amazon but they were for some time without it being obvious how they could have been created. What is Amazon doing? An Amazon spokesperson told Sky News: \"We have content guidelines governing which books can be listed for sale, and we have proactive and reactive methods that help us detect content that violates our guidelines, whether AI-generated or not. \"We invest significant time and resources to ensure our guidelines are followed, and remove books that do not adhere to those guidelines. \"We aim to provide the best possible shopping, reading, and publishing experience, and we are constantly evaluating developments that impact that experience, which includes the rapid evolution and expansion of generative AI tools. \"We continue to enhance our protections against non-compliant content, and our process and guidelines will keep evolving as we see changes in publishing.\" Read more:Cara Delevingne on Topshop inspirationNHS to use AI tech to free hospital beds People releasing books via Kindle Direct Publishing (KDP) are required to inform Amazon if content is AI-generated, but that information is not passed on to consumers. KDP authors can be asked by Amazon to verify their identities. Unofficial biographies are a staple of the publishing industry, often written by journalists on celebrities and politicians, but involving their own research and writing. The growing concern is the limited human involvement in putting together books - without it being clear to those browsing online platforms and searching for books to buy. Those churning out AI books are often rapidly reacting to news, such as the election of Pope Leo in May, when few could have been prepared to write at such length about him. The Publishers Association is discussing the framework for AI with the government. \"These large language models that exist now are so powerful that it's become incredibly easy to create content of all types,\" Mr Conway said. \"You've effectively got the threat of information saturation. \"So a cookbook comes out on a topic and is particularly well-received. You can have, within days, thousands of other titles that are spun up that then compete directly with that product.\""

        "Content": "\n          News correspondent\n              @esadiya\n  Fashion brand Topshop celebrated its relaunch with its first catwalk in seven years. The company's website promised everyone was invited as models strutted down a runway on Trafalgar Square in front of noughties fashion icons Cara Delevingne and Adwoa Aboah and the London Mayor Sir Sadiq Khan. The label has been operating on the online fashion platform ASOS after ceasing to operate as a standalone business in 2020. Its previous owner, Sir Philip Green's Arcadia group, collapsed into administration and all of Topshop's physical stores - including the Oxford Circus flagship in London's West End - closed soon after. Delevingne told Sky News she was \"totally blown away\" by the relaunch event. \"It was like nostalgia mixed with something eclectic but also something brand new,\" she said. \"For me, it really brings back a time of exploration of my own fashion sense because I think for me at Topshop I got to discover so much.\" The model, who is working on a capsule collection for next year, has already unveiled a choice edit in this year's show and said her relationship with Topshop precedes her fame. She said: \"I would go in and my friends would be like 'you would look good in that' and I would go 'no, that's not really me', and then you'd try it on and be like 'oh maybe I can explore more'. \"They really have everything for everyone, and I feel like they brought that back.\" The runway showcased highlights from its Autumn-Winter 2025 collection, as well as an early preview of pieces set to drop later this season, including showstopper gowns, the classic white tee, and an aloe vera-coloured faux fur coat that surely should not have been on display - to prevent just about everyone rushing to buy it. Reclaiming the high street But sharp tailoring and statement outerwear suggest the brand is ready to reclaim the high street. Must-have denim pieces completed the womenswear line-up while the Topman collection screamed modern utility by blending refined formal wear with sharp new silhouettes. Casual pieces are grounded by authentic denim in deep indigos, which stood out on Trafalgar Square's magnificent stone steps. Topshop's relaunch comes as the high street continues to struggle and as the UK operation of Chinese fashion giant Shein announced pre-tax profits of £38.3m for the year, up some £14m from 2023. 'Top end of the market' Moses Rashid, global marketing director at Topshop/Topman said they are competing in a different space. \"We're at the top end of the market. We're about elevation. We pride ourselves on the quality of the product,\" he said. Those products are being designed in north London, and managing director Michelle Wilson said the aim is to stay that way. \"We are a British brand, we want to be a positive force for fashion. We want to bring London to the world. It's fundamental to who we are as a brand, our style is very much London-driven.\" The majority Danish-owned company has suggested it will slow fashion down by opening physical stores where customers can touch the products, browse collections and try things on, though the flagship on Oxford Circus is unlikely to return because a Swedish fast furniture brand has since occupied the space. Designer Wayne Hemingway has previously collaborated with Topshop and said the relaunch must be more than nostalgia.

        "Content": "Artificial Intelligence (AI) technology is being piloted to help free up NHS hospital beds being used by people who are fit to be sent home, officials have said. A new platform, currently being trialled by Chelsea and Westminster NHS Trust, uses AI to help fill out the documents needed to discharge a patient - potentially saving hours of delays. The tool extracts information such as diagnoses and test results from medical records, helping staff to draft discharge summaries, which must be completed before a person is sent home from the hospital. The document is then reviewed by healthcare professionals responsible for the patient and used to send them home or refer them to other services. Health Secretary Wes Streeting has said the technology will allow doctors to spend less time on paperwork and more time on patient care, cutting waiting times in the process. The tool will be hosted on the NHS Federated Data Platform (FDP), a shared software system designed to make it easier for health and care organisations to work together and provide better services. The current manual system can leave patients waiting for hours to be discharged as doctors may be too busy to fill in forms, according to the Department for Science, Innovation and Technology. Mr Streeting said: \"This potentially transformational discharge tool is a prime example of how we're shifting from analogue to digital as part of our 10-year health plan. \"We're using cutting-edge technology to build an NHS fit for the future and tackle the hospital backlogs that have left too many people waiting too long.\" 👉Listen to Politics at Sam and Anne's on your podcast app👈    The platform is one of a number of projects backed by Sir Keir Starmer, who in January said that AI would be used to \"turn around\" the economy and public services. In May, the government announced it was rolling out an AI tool to test public feeling on different issues, which it said could save around £20m in staffing. It has also been announced that technology shown to halve the time probation officers spend organising notes will be rolled out nationwide this year."

        "Content": " Vladimir Putin made demands to take control of key regions of Ukraine during his talks with Donald Trump, it has been widely reported, as a condition for ending the war. During their summit in Alaska, the Russian leader is said to have told the US president he wants the eastern Donetsk and Luhansk regions - and would give up other Ukrainian territories held by his troops in exchange. The plans were reported by several news outlets, citing sources close to the matter, as Mr Trump scheduled a further meeting with Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy in Washington DC for Monday. He has said this could potentially pave the way for a three-way meeting with Mr Putin. Mr Trump reportedly backs the plans, according to some outlets - but Mr Zelenskyy has previously ruled out formally handing any territory to Moscow. Russia already controls a fifth of Ukraine, including about three-quarters of Donetsk province, which it first entered in 2014. US-Russia talks on Ukraine - latest updates Details of the plans emerged after little was revealed during the high-profile summit between the US and Russian leaders on Friday. Despite threats by the US president beforehand, of sanctions for Russia should there be no agreement on a ceasefire, a short news briefing after the talks ended with no mention of a suspension of fighting, no announced agreement on how to end the war, and little clarity about the next steps. On Saturday, Mr Trump appeared to change his stance on what he hopes to achieve in Ukraine, indicating he wants a permanent peace settlement rather than a ceasefire. \"It was determined by all that the best way to end the horrific war between Russia and Ukraine is to go directly to a Peace Agreement, which would end the war, and not a mere Ceasefire Agreement, which often times do not hold up,\" he said in a post on his social network site, Truth Social. Trump: 'Russia is a big power - they're not' In an interview with Fox News following the summit, Mr Trump signalled he and Putin had discussed land transfers and security guarantees for Ukraine, and had \"largely agreed\". He said Ukraine has to made a deal, as \"Russia is a very big power, and they're not\". Monday's meeting at the White House will be the Ukrainian president's second this year. His last descended into a fiery spat with Mr Trump and his vice president JD Vance, which saw him leave early. After the fresh meeting was announced, Mr Zelenskyy in a post on X that he was grateful for the invitation.

However, he said Russia had rebuffed \"numerous calls for a ceasefire and has not yet determined when it will stop the killing\", which \"complicates the situation\". Mr Zelenskyy continued: \"If they lack the will to carry out a simple order to stop the strikes, it may take a lot of effort to get Russia to have the will to implement far greater - peaceful coexistence with its neighbours for decades. \"But together we are working for peace and security. Stopping the killing is a key element of stopping the war.\"  Putin releases statement on summit In a statement on the summit, Mr Putin described the talks as \"timely and quite useful\" - but said the \"removal\" of what he calls the \"root causes\" of the crisis \"must underlie the settlement\". He continued: \"We definitely respect the US administration's position which wants the hostilities to stop as soon as possible. So do we, and we would like to move forward with settling all issues by peaceful means. \"The conversation was very frank and substantive, which, in my view, moves us closer towards making necessary decisions.\" European leaders who make up the \"coalition of the willing\" are set to hold a conference call today ahead of the crunch talks between Mr Trump and Mr Zelenskyy.

He said he supported the next phase of talks, but added: \"In the meantime, until (Putin) stops his barbaric assault, we will keep tightening the screws on his war machine with even more sanctions.\" Meanwhile, Ukraine's military has reported an advance of up to 2km on the Sumy front in the country's northeast. \"Zones of continuous enemy fire damage are being maintained,\" the Ukrainian General Staff said on Telegram. \"Ukrainian troops are repelling Russian forces\".

The coalition - co-chaired by Sir Keir Starmer, France's President Emmanuel Macron and Germany's Chancellor Friedrich Merz - has the aim of bringing countries together to protect a peace deal in Ukraine. Top of the agenda at Sunday's meeting will be securing a concrete commitment from Mr Trump on a security guarantee that would act as a powerful backstop in any Russia-Ukraine peacekeeping arrangement. Ukraine war latest: Putin comments on Trump talks European leaders seemed buoyed by the US president's most recent hints on the subject, in the knowledge that US military might is likely to deter Vladimir Putin from advancing in the future. They will also discuss how to bring Mr Zelenskyy into talks after Mr Trump and Mr Putin's Alaska meeting saw him left out in the cold. In coordinated statements, European leaders said Mr Zelenskyy must play a greater role in future talks, and that peace cannot be achieved without him. The hard bit will be to persuade the unpredictable US administration to change its approach, something that has proved almost impossible in the past.  When Mr Trump re-entered the White House and made it clear the US would no longer provide a blank cheque to protect peace in Europe, others decided they had to step up, and the 'coalition of the willing' was thrown together in March. Since then, information about the allied peacekeeping effort has been patchy, but we know it includes over 30 countries, which have been asked to pledge whatever military support they can, including troops.

        "Content": " Hand pats, manspreading and tell-tale signs of discontent - there was plenty on display in the body language of Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin to show who had the upper hand in their Ukraine negotiations, an expert has told Sky News. All eyes were on the two world leaders as they met on the red carpet at the Elmendorf-Richardson military base in Alaska, and again as they emerged a few hours later from their much-anticipated summit. Zelenskyy going to Washington; follow latest updates While at first it was all \"genuine smiles\", when the leaders emerged from their private meeting, the lack of a deal was written all over Trump's face, according to body language expert and psychologist Dr Peter Collett. Trump gets the last hand pat Even in their very first handshake, there was plenty to be analysed in terms of body language, Dr Collett says. Putin was the first to extend his hand, showing \"his enthusiasm, delight\" and \"commitment\" to the occasion. But within the handshake itself were no less than five \"hand pats\", Dr Collett adds, which offer more insight. \"During the handshakes, we also see several pats,\" the expert says. Putin got the first, with his \"rather tentative and much less dramatic than those produced by Trump\". By contrast, Trump's hand pats were a \"status reminder\" and \"his way of telling Putin that he's the man in charge\". At one stage, the US president allowed his Russian counterpart to pat his hand. Although this allowed Putin to place his hand on top, seemingly asserting his dominance, this signature move of Trump's actually allows him to \"flex his muscles\", Dr Collett says. \"One of the reasons Trump makes a habit of doing this is that it allows him to flex his bicep and pull the other [person] towards him.\" Importantly, he also got the last hand pat of the interaction, Dr Collett adds. \"That's what we find with high-dominance individuals, particularly politicians, they always want to have the last touch.\" Putin wins on manspreading Once the pair were sat down in front of the cameras, it was Putin who appeared more dominant, which he achieved through a wider \"manspread\" than his American counterpart. The term manspreading first emerged on social media in 2013 when it was used to describe men on public transport who encroach on adjacent seats by spreading their legs wide apart. \"Highly dominant men tend to spread their thighs wide apart,\" Dr Collett says. \"If you look at the angle between them, when we compare Trump and Putin, we find Putin with a much wider spread, in other words, displaying much greater dominance.\" During the news conference, Putin's dominance was also conveyed in his posture, Dr Collett adds. \"In spite of their difference in height, Putin, although he's very short, sits upright, ramrod, looking very confident, whereas poor old Trump is crumpled and turned inwards.\" This could reflect him having \"a lot on his mind that's bothering him\", the expert suggests. Hand behind back shows dominance As the two leaders moved around the military base, Trump made a point of placing his hand behind Putin's back. Traditionally, a show of chivalry, in this context, it was another power play, Dr Collett says. \"It looks like an expression of politeness, but in fact it's a dominance display, because it's the person who's in power, who's superior, calling the shots. \"They're guiding the other individual through the space. And that's exactly what we see here… Trump gets his hand behind Putin and guides him through the next phase of the meeting.\" Genuine smiles Despite the repeated, thinly veiled attempts to appear the most powerful, both leaders had \"genuine smiles\" for each other, particularly when they first met, according to Dr Collett. \"What's interesting is the high degree of smiling,\" he says. \"It's a very serious, sombre occasion and yet they find time to smile and display their pleasure - not only at meeting each other but about the whole exercise.\" The smiles were genuine because they \"evolve naturally\" and \"involved both sides of the face\", Dr Collett explains. \"They enlist those special little muscles around the eye, which are an indication of genuine pleasure,\" he says. Read moreWhat we expected from summit - and what actually happenedTrump-Putin summit in picturesMapping the land Ukraine could be told to give up Whereas later on, during the news conference, after the pair failed to negotiate a ceasefire, Trump offered Putin a \"fake, flashbulb\" smile, evidencing his disdain. All in the eyes - and the mouth After the two-and-a-half-hour meeting behind closed doors, Trump's dissatisfaction over the lack of a deal was clear in his body language, Dr Collett says. He tried to assert what psychologists refer to as \"visual dominance\" by avoiding Putin's gaze. 👉 Follow Trump100 on your podcast app 👈 This technique is often used by \"high-status individuals\" to assert power - but it could also be a defence mechanism to \"remove the negative stimulus\" from the situation, Dr Collett suggests. \"Trump hasn't succeeded in getting a real concession from Putin on this occasion. He's looking away because he doesn't want to be reminded of the individual who's failing to give something he can take to the American public and the world and say, 'hey look, this is what I succeeded in doing'.\" The shape of Trump's mouth is another tell-tale sign of his discontent. He pursed his lips on several occasions, which denotes \"self-restraint\", while his \"oxbow mouth\" showed his vulnerability, according to Dr Collett. \"Politicians are quite fond of using this particular mouth posture because they think it makes them look determined,\" he says. But the tensed chin is a \"fascinating giveaway\", he adds. \"It's almost as though they believe consciously that somebody is going to punch them on the chin. So when you see politicians doing that mouth posture, it's quite often because they're feeling vulnerable because they feel the need to protect themselves. \"And that's my feeling - Trump was full of promise, but he came away with nothing, and we find that revealed in his little mouth postures\"."

America may carry on supporting their defence but now by selling not supplying weapons. It may or may not carry on providing absolutely essential military intelligence. But otherwise they are increasingly on their own. That penny has been dropping for months in European capitals. Alaska has only rammed the point further home. The challenge for Europe is to ramp up its ability to support Ukraine quickly enough to fill the growing vacuum left by an American president whose sympathies increasingly lie elsewhere."

        "Content": "\n          Moscow correspondent\n              @IvorBennett\n  For Vladimir Putin, this really couldn't have gone much better. From the red carpet to the flypast - the indicted war criminal was feted like a king. The only other places that have welcomed him like this in recent years are the likes of China and North Korea, Russia's old friends. It seems Moscow has now gained a new ally, and it was shaped by the body language of bromance. Trump-Putin summit: Follow latest developments  The Kremlin leader's most pressing aim in Anchorage was to temper Trump's frustrations. It was only a week ago that Moscow faced an ultimatum: ceasefire or sanctions. But there was no mention of either. The word \"ceasefire\" and the word \"sanctions\" weren't even uttered once. The leaders appear to have reached a loose framework. But for what? We don't know because details were not forthcoming. \n                  Vladimir Putin demands key regions of Ukraine in 'exchange for peace'\n                 \n                  Starmer to meet with European leaders for 'coalition of the willing' talks on Ukraine\n                 \n                  Body language expert reveals Trump and Putin's key giveaways from their Alaska summit\n                 But the fact Vladimir Putin spoke of the need to eliminate the \"root causes\" of the conflict will not fill Ukraine with hope. That phrase essentially means that Russia's red lines are as indelible as ever - on territory, neutrality for Ukraine and limits to its armed forces - and Moscow has no intention of watering them down. Come the news conference, it was abundantly clear who was calling the shots.  Not only did Vladimir Putin speak first but there were also no questions - both things surely unprecedented in the world of Trump's media relations. Given how choreographed Putin's news conferences usually are, I expect the lack of Q&A was a condition laid down by his team.  All the more remarkable was Trump's willingness and ability to comply with it - a sign of how much he values his relationship with the Kremlin. \"Pursuing peace\" was the summit slogan, but it felt like Vladimir Putin was pursuing something else - the start of a new chapter in US-Russia relations that Ukraine will fear may come at their expense."

WARNING: This shows people suffering from malnutrition which you may find distressing Her malnutrition is so severe, she can no longer eat. Her tiny ribcage juts out of her chest. Her upper arms are thinner than her wrists. Every blink looks like it's a struggle. Her eyes are tired and sad. \"What is your dream now?\" a family friend who's filming asks her. \"To go back to the way I was,\" she whispers back. Maryam Dawas used to weigh 25kg (3st 9lb). Now she weighs nine (1st 4lb). That's about the weight of a baby that hasn't yet reached its first birthday. \"Maryam suffered from malnutrition ever since we were displaced from the north to Rafah,\" her mother explains. \"Because of the famine that was in the south, we went through a famine, but it wasn't worse than the one we are in now.\" Maryam's case is hardly unique. The latest report on Gaza from the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) says that almost 13,000 new admissions of children for acute malnutrition were recorded in July. The latest numbers from the Gaza Health Ministry are 251 dead as a result of famine and malnutrition, including 108 children. Read moreGaza's deadliest day in a week claims 100 livesMadonna urges the Pope to go to GazaFuneral for Al Jazeera journalists killed in strike \"I went to multiple hospitals in the last week and every one of them is overwhelmed with malnutrition cases, severe malnutrition - children, teenagers, you name it,\" OCHA Gaza representative Olga Cherevko tells me. \"And whether it's a pre-existing condition or malnutrition on its own, the fact that it's in the state that it is means that it exacerbates whatever condition exists on top of it.\" Israel's coordinator of government activities in the territories (COGAT) claimed on Tuesday that Hamas was inflating the numbers of people in Gaza dying of malnutrition, and that most of the children who had died had pre-existing health conditions. But that is the thing about famine. It seeks out the vulnerable first and then it settles in, ingraining itself with the weak and the poverty-stricken, exacerbating their problems. In his book Poverty and Famines, the Nobel prize-winning economist Amartya Sen writes as his opening line: \"Starvation is the characteristic of some people not having enough food to eat. It is not the characteristic of there not being enough food to eat.\"  Aid not getting to the most weak and vulnerable There is now a trickle of aid getting into Gaza, but it is getting to those who are strong enough to fight for it. Siphoned off from aid points and sold on the black market, it is getting to the few who still have some money to pay for it. It is not getting to the weak, the vulnerable and the poor, though that describes the majority of Gaza's 2.1 million residents. According to the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (ICE) which measures food insecurity and famine, 81% of households in Gaza reported poor food consumption in July, up from 33% in April; 24% of households experienced very severe hunger in July, compared with 4% in April; and nearly nine out of 10 households resorted to \"extremely severe coping mechanisms\" to feed themselves. That huge hike in food insecurity follows on directly from Israel's total blockade, which began on 2 March and ended on 19 May when Israel began a limited resumption of food supplies. Eleven weeks in which nothing at all came in, compounding almost two years of war and a partial blockade of Gaza ongoing since 2007. The UK says it plans to evacuate more injured and critically ill children from Gaza \"at pace\". For children like Maryam, that could not happen soon enough."

        "Content": "A hurricane making its way across the Caribbean Sea has quickly turned into a Category 5 storm, having rapidly strengthened in just 24 hours.  Hurricane Erin - the first of the 2025 Atlantic season - has raced from maximum sustained winds of 100mph (160kph) to 160mph (255kph). It gained power as it began moving westward past the Leeward Islands - which include Anguilla, Guadaloupe, and the Virgin Islands - on Saturday. While the hurricane is not forecast to make landfall, it is expected to \"produce life-threatening surf and rip currents\" as it turns northward next week, the US National Hurricane Centre said. Beaches in the Bahamas, much of the east coast of the United States and even Atlantic Canada will be affected, it added. Protruding US coastal areas - such as Long Island, New York and Cape Cod - face a higher risk of direct and potentially severe tropical storm or hurricane conditions, AccuWeather said.  The hurricane's impact is already being felt on multiple islands. Tropical storm watches have been issued for some Caribbean islands, including St Barts and St Maarten. The National Hurricane Centre (NHC) has warned heavy rain could cause flash flooding, landslides and mudslides, saying Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands could be affected on Sunday. The US government deployed more than 200 workers, including employees from the Federal Emergency Management Agency, to Puerto Rico as a precaution when a flood watch for the territory was issued earlier this week. With hurricane-force winds extending 30 miles from its centre, Erin is considered compact in size. It should begin to slowly weaken on Monday but will remain a major hurricane until late next week, the NHC said. Storms that ramp up so quickly complicate forecasting and make it harder for government agencies to plan for emergencies. Scientists have linked the rapid intensification of hurricanes in the Atlantic Ocean to climate change, as global warming is causing the atmosphere to hold more water vapour and spiking ocean temperatures. The warmer waters give hurricanes fuel to strengthen quickly and unleash more rain. Erin is the fifth named storm of the Atlantic hurricane season, which began on 1 June and runs until 30 November. It is the first to become a hurricane."

        "Content": " Vladimir Putin made demands to take control of key regions of Ukraine during his talks with Donald Trump, it has been widely reported, as a condition for ending the war. During their summit in Alaska, the Russian leader is said to have told the US president he wants the eastern Donetsk and Luhansk regions - and would give up other Ukrainian territories held by his troops in exchange. The plans were reported by several news outlets, citing sources close to the matter, as Mr Trump scheduled a further meeting with Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy in Washington DC for Monday. He has said this could potentially pave the way for a three-way meeting with Mr Putin. Mr Trump reportedly backs the plans, according to some outlets - but Mr Zelenskyy has previously ruled out formally handing any territory to Moscow. Russia already controls a fifth of Ukraine, including about three-quarters of Donetsk province, which it first entered in 2014. US-Russia talks on Ukraine - latest updates Details of the plans emerged after little was revealed during the high-profile summit between the US and Russian leaders on Friday. Despite threats by the US president beforehand, of sanctions for Russia should there be no agreement on a ceasefire, a short news briefing after the talks ended with no mention of a suspension of fighting, no announced agreement on how to end the war, and little clarity about the next steps. On Saturday, Mr Trump appeared to change his stance on what he hopes to achieve in Ukraine, indicating he wants a permanent peace settlement rather than a ceasefire. \"It was determined by all that the best way to end the horrific war between Russia and Ukraine is to go directly to a Peace Agreement, which would end the war, and not a mere Ceasefire Agreement, which often times do not hold up,\" he said in a post on his social network site, Truth Social. Trump: 'Russia is a big power - they're not' In an interview with Fox News following the summit, Mr Trump signalled he and Putin had discussed land transfers and security guarantees for Ukraine, and had \"largely agreed\". He said Ukraine has to made a deal, as \"Russia is a very big power, and they're not\". Monday's meeting at the White House will be the Ukrainian president's second this year. His last descended into a fiery spat with Mr Trump and his vice president JD Vance, which saw him leave early. After the fresh meeting was announced, Mr Zelenskyy in a post on X that he was grateful for the invitation. Read more:Key takeaways from Sky correspondentsBody language expert unpacks the summit  \"It is important that everyone agrees there needs to be a conversation at the level of leaders to clarify all the details and determine which steps are necessary and will work,\" he said. However, he said Russia had rebuffed \"numerous calls for a ceasefire and has not yet determined when it will stop the killing\", which \"complicates the situation\". Mr Zelenskyy continued: \"If they lack the will to carry out a simple order to stop the strikes, it may take a lot of effort to get Russia to have the will to implement far greater - peaceful coexistence with its neighbours for decades. \"But together we are working for peace and security. Stopping the killing is a key element of stopping the war.\"  Putin releases statement on summit In a statement on the summit, Mr Putin described the talks as \"timely and quite useful\" - but said the \"removal\" of what he calls the \"root causes\" of the crisis \"must underlie the settlement\". He continued: \"We definitely respect the US administration's position which wants the hostilities to stop as soon as possible. So do we, and we would like to move forward with settling all issues by peaceful means. \"The conversation was very frank and substantive, which, in my view, moves us closer towards making necessary decisions.\" European leaders who make up the \"coalition of the willing\" are set to hold a conference call today ahead of the crunch talks between Mr Trump and Mr Zelenskyy. Prime Minister Keir Starmer, French President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Friedrich Merz will host the video conference.

He said he supported the next phase of talks, but added: \"In the meantime, until (Putin) stops his barbaric assault, we will keep tightening the screws on his war machine with even more sanctions.\" Meanwhile, Ukraine's military has reported an advance of up to 2km on the Sumy front in the country's northeast. \"Zones of continuous enemy fire damage are being maintained,\" the Ukrainian General Staff said on Telegram. \"Ukrainian troops are repelling Russian forces\". In the early hours of Sunday, a regional governor in Russia said a railway employee had been injured and a power line damaged by a Ukrainian drone attack. The incident happened in the Voronezh region, Alexander Gusev said on Telegram."

If Trump was sincere in wanting the killing to end he could resort to far more effective means than inconclusive summitry. Secondary sanctions on Russia's oil industry and those who trade in it would be something for Putin to think about. Read more:Mapping the land Ukraine could be told to give upWhat we expected from the summit - and what happened Ukrainians are hugely frustrated Trump seems strangely reluctant to impose them. To them, this summit was an elaborate ruse to avoid doing so again. In both substance and outcome Alaska sends a clear message to Ukraine and its European allies. America may carry on supporting their defence but now by selling not supplying weapons. It may or may not carry on providing absolutely essential military intelligence. But otherwise they are increasingly on their own. That penny has been dropping for months in European capitals. Alaska has only rammed the point further home. The challenge for Europe is to ramp up its ability to support Ukraine quickly enough to fill the growing vacuum left by an American president whose sympathies increasingly lie elsewhere."

        "Content": "\n          US correspondent\n              @marthakelner\n  Donald Trump landed at Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson with the aspiration of departing a few hours later hailed as a peacemaker and a deal broker. Instead, he returns to Washington having let an international pariah back in from the cold and seemingly received precious little in return. If President Vladimir Putin pitched up on the tarmac of many of the world's airports, he could, in theory, be immediately handcuffed. This, after all, is a man wanted by the International Criminal Court for alleged war crimes, including for the alleged abduction of Ukrainian children. Instead, the red carpet was, quite literally, rolled out for him in Anchorage. Summit latest: No deal but progress made, says Trump A flypast was arranged, featuring F-35 fighter jets, the very planes that are regularly scrambled to intercept Russian aircraft operating off the coast of Alaska. Various military members lined up to salute him. Then came the most surprising moment of all. Alongside President Donald Trump, Putin climbed into The Beast, the US president's heavily armoured limousine. A dictator, who invaded a sovereign nation three-and-a-half years ago and has been in isolation ever since, riding alongside the most powerful man in the world on a US military base. No wonder he was grinning in the back seat.  In the news conference afterwards, Putin was invited to speak before Trump and talked of greeting him on arrival, referring to him as a \"dear neighbour\". You would be forgiven for thinking this was a summit on Putin's home turf and not the other way round. There was talk of an agreement, but no detail at all on what was agreed. And, there was not a word on the issue at the heart of the matter: ceasefire. Trump is the producer of his own presidency, and this summit was carefully choreographed, made for TV, even if it was thrown together at short notice. But it was Putin who seemed to be pulling the strings. Journalists shouted questions at him about whether he had underestimated Ukraine, and about the killing of civilians. But he threw a deaf ear. And in his presence, Trump - who loves to talk so much - kept schtum, too. Read more:Trump and Putin agree on 'many points' - but give little detail awayIn maps: The land Ukraine could be told to give upWhat we expected from the summit - and what happened  There was a mismatch in their delegations, too. Putin was joined in the bilat by his grizzled and chiselled foreign secretary, Sergey Lavrov, a veteran of these events, and a wily negotiator. Trump sat alongside his old golfing pal Steve Witkoff, a real estate agent who is now Trump's peace envoy, trying to resolve the conflicts in Ukraine and in Gaza. Witkoff's repeated visits to Moscow in recent months led to this summit. Some were left wondering whether he had miscalculated how much Putin was willing to shift on his maximalist goals in Ukraine. Many foreign policy experts believe Witkoff is too naive for the job and this meeting won't have persuaded them otherwise. The Kremlin team, as ever, had done their homework. They know that Trump responds to flattery. And flatter him, Putin did. One of Trump's most consistent lines is that he would never have invaded Ukraine if Trump were president. Putin gave him a PR boost by suggesting that it was an accurate sentiment. He also, Trump says, agreed with him that he would have won the 2020 election. In the lead-up to the meeting, Trump promised \"severe consequences\" for Russia if Putin did not agree to a ceasefire. There is no suggestion that he did. Yet Trump appeared on Fox News and talked admiringly of him, claiming Putin \"spoke very sincerely\", with Trump saying he believed the Russian President genuinely had a desire to end the war in Ukraine. The fact that Putin started the war and continues his onslaught in Ukraine, seemingly overlooked. Trump applauded Putin on his arrival in Alaska and the Russian president must have been patting himself on the back on the way out."

        "Content": "A hurricane making its way across the Caribbean Sea has quickly turned into a Category 5 storm, having rapidly strengthened in just 24 hours.  Hurricane Erin - the first of the 2025 Atlantic season - has raced from maximum sustained winds of 100mph (160kph) to 160mph (255kph). It gained power as it began moving westward past the Leeward Islands - which include Anguilla, Guadaloupe, and the Virgin Islands - on Saturday. While the hurricane is not forecast to make landfall, it is expected to \"produce life-threatening surf and rip currents\" as it turns northward next week, the US National Hurricane Centre said. Beaches in the Bahamas, much of the east coast of the United States and even Atlantic Canada will be affected, it added. Protruding US coastal areas - such as Long Island, New York and Cape Cod - face a higher risk of direct and potentially severe tropical storm or hurricane conditions, AccuWeather said.  The hurricane's impact is already being felt on multiple islands. Tropical storm watches have been issued for some Caribbean islands, including St Barts and St Maarten. The National Hurricane Centre (NHC) has warned heavy rain could cause flash flooding, landslides and mudslides, saying Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands could be affected on Sunday. The US government deployed more than 200 workers, including employees from the Federal Emergency Management Agency, to Puerto Rico as a precaution when a flood watch for the territory was issued earlier this week. With hurricane-force winds extending 30 miles from its centre, Erin is considered compact in size. It should begin to slowly weaken on Monday but will remain a major hurricane until late next week, the NHC said. Storms that ramp up so quickly complicate forecasting and make it harder for government agencies to plan for emergencies. Scientists have linked the rapid intensification of hurricanes in the Atlantic Ocean to climate change, as global warming is causing the atmosphere to hold more water vapour and spiking ocean temperatures. The warmer waters give hurricanes fuel to strengthen quickly and unleash more rain. Erin is the fifth named storm of the Atlantic hurricane season, which began on 1 June and runs until 30 November. It is the first to become a hurricane."

        "Content": "\n          City editor\n              @MarkKleinmanSky\n The metals tycoon Sanjeev Gupta is this weekend plotting a controversial deal to salvage his remaining UK steel operations and avert their collapse into compulsory liquidation – a move that would put close to 1,500 jobs at risk. Sky News has learnt that Mr Gupta is in talks about a so-called connected pre-pack administration of Liberty Steel's Speciality Steel UK (SSUK) arm, which would involve the assets being sold - potentially to parties linked to him - after shedding hundreds of millions of pounds of tax and other liabilities to creditors. Begbies Traynor, the accountancy firm, is understood to be working on efforts to progress the pre-pack deal. This weekend, Whitehall sources said that government officials had stepped up planning for the collapse of SSUK if an already-deferred winding-up petition scheduled to be heard next Wednesday is approved. If that were to happen, SSUK would be likely to enter compulsory liquidation within days, with a special manager appointed by the Official Receiver to run the operations. Mr Gupta's UK business operates steel plants at Sheffield and Rotherham in South Yorkshire, with a combined workforce of more than 1,400 people. SSUK is Britain's third-largest steel producer. \n                  Cara Delevingne reveals how Topshop inspired her fashion sense - as brand relaunches in London\n                 \n                  Government will not offer bailout to UK's largest bioethanol plant\n                 \n                  Weekend Money: The 'stealth shoppers' keeping pricey secrets from their partners - and what it says about their relationships\n                 Sources close to Mr Gupta could yet secure a further adjournment of the winding-up petition to buy him additional breathing space from creditors. In May, a hearing was adjourned after lawyers acting for SSUK said talks had been taking place with \"a third-party purchaser\". Their identity has not been publicly disclosed, and it has been unclear in recent weeks if any such discussions were continuing. A connected pre-pack risks stiff opposition from Liberty Steel's creditors, which include HM Revenue and Customs. UBS, the investment bank which rescued Credit Suisse, a major backer of the collapsed finance firm Greensill Capital - which itself had a multibillion dollar exposure to Liberty Steel's parent, GFG Alliance - is also a creditor of the company. Grant Thornton, the accountancy firm handling Greensill's administration, is also watching the legal proceedings with interest. The Serious Fraud Office launched a probe into GFG - which stands for Gupta Family Group - in 2022. On Saturday, a Liberty Steel spokesperson said: \"Discussions are ongoing to finalise options for SSUK. \"We remain committed to identifying a solution that preserves electric arc furnace steelmaking in the UK-a critical national capability supporting strategic supply chains. \"We continue to work towards an outcome that best serves the interests of creditors, employees, and the broader community.\" Last month, The Guardian reported that Jonathan Reynolds, the business secretary, was monitoring events at Liberty Steel's SSUK arm, and had not ruled out stepping in to provide support to the company. Such a move is still thought to be an option, although it is not said to be imminent. A government spokesperson said: \"We continue to closely monitor developments around Liberty Steel, including any public hearings, which are a matter for the company.\" Read more:Lola's Cupcakes bakes £30m takeover by Finsbury FoodTrump's son-in-law Kushner takes stake in UK lender OakNorth Wednesday's winding-up petition was filed by Harsco Metals Group, a supplier of materials and labour to SSUK, and is said to be supported by other trade creditors. Mr Reynolds has already orchestrated the rescue of British Steel, the Scunthorpe-based steelmaker, after failing to reach a government aid deal with Jingye Group, the company's Chinese owner. Jingye had been preparing to permanently close Scunthorpe's remaining blast furnaces, prompting Mr Reynolds to step in and seize control of the company in April. The government has yet to make a decision to formally nationalise British Steel, although that is anticipated in the autumn. Tata Steel, the owner of Britain's biggest steelworks at Port Talbot, has agreed a £500m government grant to build an electric arc furnace capable of manufacturing greener steel. Other parts of Mr Gupta's empire have been showing signs of financial stress for years. The Financial Times reported in May that he was preparing to call in administrators to oversee the insolvency of Liberty Commodities. Separately, HMRC filed a winding-up petition against Liberty Pipes, another subsidiary, earlier this month, The Guardian reported. Mr Gupta is said to have explored whether he could persuade the government to step in and support SSUK using the legislation enacted to take control of British Steel's operations. Whitehall insiders told Sky News in May that Mr Gupta's overtures had been rebuffed. He had previously sought government aid during the pandemic but that plea was also rejected by ministers. SSUK, which also operates from a site in Bolton, Lancashire, makes highly engineered steel products for use in sectors such as aerospace, automotive and oil and gas. The company said earlier this year that it had invested nearly £200m in the last five years into the UK steel industry, but had faced \"significant challenges due to soaring energy costs and an over-reliance on cheap imports, negatively impacting the performance of all UK steel companies\"."

        "Content": "\n          News correspondent\n              @esadiya\n  Fashion brand Topshop celebrated its relaunch with its first catwalk in seven years. The company's website promised everyone was invited as models strutted down a runway on Trafalgar Square in front of noughties fashion icons Cara Delevingne and Adwoa Aboah and the London Mayor Sir Sadiq Khan. The label has been operating on the online fashion platform ASOS after ceasing to operate as a standalone business in 2020. Its previous owner, Sir Philip Green's Arcadia group, collapsed into administration and all of Topshop's physical stores - including the Oxford Circus flagship in London's West End - closed soon after. Delevingne told Sky News she was \"totally blown away\" by the relaunch event. \"It was like nostalgia mixed with something eclectic but also something brand new,\" she said. \"For me, it really brings back a time of exploration of my own fashion sense because I think for me at Topshop I got to discover so much.\" The model, who is working on a capsule collection for next year, has already unveiled a choice edit in this year's show and said her relationship with Topshop precedes her fame. She said: \"I would go in and my friends would be like 'you would look good in that' and I would go 'no, that's not really me', and then you'd try it on and be like 'oh maybe I can explore more'. \"They really have everything for everyone, and I feel like they brought that back.\" The runway showcased highlights from its Autumn-Winter 2025 collection, as well as an early preview of pieces set to drop later this season, including showstopper gowns, the classic white tee, and an aloe vera-coloured faux fur coat that surely should not have been on display - to prevent just about everyone rushing to buy it. Reclaiming the high street But sharp tailoring and statement outerwear suggest the brand is ready to reclaim the high street. Must-have denim pieces completed the womenswear line-up while the Topman collection screamed modern utility by blending refined formal wear with sharp new silhouettes. Casual pieces are grounded by authentic denim in deep indigos, which stood out on Trafalgar Square's magnificent stone steps. Topshop's relaunch comes as the high street continues to struggle and as the UK operation of Chinese fashion giant Shein announced pre-tax profits of £38.3m for the year, up some £14m from 2023. 'Top end of the market' Moses Rashid, global marketing director at Topshop/Topman said they are competing in a different space. \"We're at the top end of the market. We're about elevation. We pride ourselves on the quality of the product,\" he said. Those products are being designed in north London, and managing director Michelle Wilson said the aim is to stay that way. \"We are a British brand, we want to be a positive force for fashion. We want to bring London to the world. It's fundamental to who we are as a brand, our style is very much London-driven.\" The majority Danish-owned company has suggested it will slow fashion down by opening physical stores where customers can touch the products, browse collections and try things on, though the flagship on Oxford Circus is unlikely to return because a Swedish fast furniture brand has since occupied the space. Designer Wayne Hemingway has previously collaborated with Topshop and said the relaunch must be more than nostalgia.

The coalition - co-chaired by Sir Keir Starmer, France's President Emmanuel Macron and Germany's Chancellor Friedrich Merz - has the aim of bringing countries together to protect a peace deal in Ukraine.

Ukraine war latest: Putin comments on Trump talks European leaders seemed buoyed by the US president's most recent hints on the subject, in the knowledge that US military might is likely to deter Vladimir Putin from advancing in the future. They will also discuss how to bring Mr Zelenskyy into talks after Mr Trump and Mr Putin's Alaska meeting saw him left out in the cold. In coordinated statements, European leaders said Mr Zelenskyy must play a greater role in future talks, and that peace cannot be achieved without him. The hard bit will be to persuade the unpredictable US administration to change its approach, something that has proved almost impossible in the past.  When Mr Trump re-entered the White House and made it clear the US would no longer provide a blank cheque to protect peace in Europe, others decided they had to step up, and the 'coalition of the willing' was thrown together in March. Since then, information about the allied peacekeeping effort has been patchy, but we know it includes over 30 countries, which have been asked to pledge whatever military support they can, including troops.

If that's a message which feels like quite a stretch in writing, in person, during this morning's call of international leaders, it must have been even more awkward. Major shift as Trump backs peace deal over ceasefire; follow latest Donald Trump's public dismissal of the Europeans' previous calls for a ceasefire - after his tete-a-tete with Putin - has only highlighted divisions. Of course, the prime minister and his European allies have no choice but to keep their criticism of the Alaskan summit implicit, not explicit. Even as they attempt to ramp up their own military preparedness to help reinforce any future peace deal, they need President Trump to lead the way in trying to force President Putin to the negotiating table - and to back up any agreement with the threat of American firepower. For Downing Street, President Trump's new willingness to contribute to any future security guarantee is a significant step, which Starmer claims \"will be crucial in deterring Putin from coming back for more\". It's a commitment the prime minister has been campaigning for for months, a caveat to all the grand plans drawn up by the so-called Coalition of the Willing. While the details are still clearly very much to be confirmed, whatever comments made by Donald Trump about his openness to help police any peace in Ukraine have been loudly welcomed by all those present, a glimmer of progress from the diplomatic mess in Anchorage.  Read moreAnalysis: Trump is the real loserAnalysis: Indicted war criminal treated like a kingKey takeaways from the Alaska summit Of course, the promise of security guarantees only means anything if a peace deal is actually reached. At the moment, as the European leaders' bluntly put it in repeating Donald Trump's words back to him: \"There's no deal until there's a deal.\"  Fears of Zelenskyy being painted as warmonger There is clearly real concern in European capitals following the US president's comments that the onus is now on Volodymyr Zelenskyy to 'do a deal', that the Ukrainians will come under growing pressure to make concessions to the Russians. As former defence secretary Ben Wallace said: \"Given that Donald Trump has failed to deliver a deal, his track record would show that Donald Trump then usually tries to seek to blame someone else. I'm worried that next week it could be President Zelenskyy who he will seek to blame. \"He'll paint him as the warmonger, when in fact everybody knows it's President Putin.\" The European leaders' robust statements describing the \"killing in Ukraine\" and Russia's \"barbaric assault\" are an attempt to try to counter that narrative, resetting the international response to Putin following the warmth of his welcome by President Trump - friendlier by far than that afforded to many of them, and infinitely more than the barracking President Zelenskyy received. They'll all be hoping to avoid a repeat of that on Monday."

But we understand there are no immediate plans for Amazon to label content that AI was involved in generating. \"AI created books are an increasing problem for us,\" Publishers Association chief executive Dan Conway told Sky News. \"It is incredibly easy using these new, amazing tools to create content. \"The problem is that on the consumer side, it's really, really difficult to tell the difference often between a properly researched book that covers a topic that you want to read about versus something that's been spun up incredibly quickly using AI technology. And you've got some real consumer confusion out there.\" In recent days, we found several books quickly feeding off England's success at the Women's Euros, which appeared to be created by AI. Books on scoring stars Chloe Kelly and Michelle Agyemang shared the same style covers, even featuring the wrong ball - from American football. Fewer than 50 pages each, they sell in paperback for about £11. The Agyemang book was published the day after her dramatic equaliser in the Euros semifinal against Italy, while the Kelly book appeared online the day after her winning penalty in the final against Spain. The named author, who has no digital trail beyond Amazon and other online retailers, has more than 45 books to their name since the start of July, on politicians, scientists, entrepreneurs and musicians, as well as sports stars. It is frustrating for sports stars telling heartfelt stories in books only to see imitations online, confusing consumers. 'It's scary' At the recent Sports Book Awards, former England football captain Steph Houghton was shocked to be told about a 50-page imitation of her autobiography, Leading From The Back, which runs for more than 300 pages. \"It takes a lot of hard work to make a book,\" she said. \"It's poor that, in terms of Amazon allowing it to be on there as well.\" Former Liverpool and Tottenham player Neil Ruddock was in disbelief about a book aping Toxic, his account of addiction, Toxic. His literary agent, James Wills, said: \"We do have a real concern about generative AI, which is what this is, somebody putting it in and using it that way.\" Former Afghanistan football captain Khalida Popal produced My Beautiful Sisters, a harrowing account of sexual abuse in her team and helping players flee the Taliban. She was stunned to be shown a similar account of her life had been produced and placed on sale online. \"It's scary,\" the award winner told Sky News. \"This story matters a lot. It's the voices and the stories of hundreds and thousands of women who suffered and who are victims and survivors of brutality and war, and challenges in Afghanistan. \"Those sisters, those voices and stories, are very important for me. That's why I really took care of it, telling that story.\" Those AI versions of the Popal, Ruddock and Houghton books are no longer available on Amazon but they were for some time without it being obvious how they could have been created. What is Amazon doing? An Amazon spokesperson told Sky News: \"We have content guidelines governing which books can be listed for sale, and we have proactive and reactive methods that help us detect content that violates our guidelines, whether AI-generated or not. \"We invest significant time and resources to ensure our guidelines are followed, and remove books that do not adhere to those guidelines. \"We aim to provide the best possible shopping, reading, and publishing experience, and we are constantly evaluating developments that impact that experience, which includes the rapid evolution and expansion of generative AI tools. \"We continue to enhance our protections against non-compliant content, and our process and guidelines will keep evolving as we see changes in publishing.\" Read more:Cara Delevingne on Topshop inspirationNHS to use AI tech to free hospital beds People releasing books via Kindle Direct Publishing (KDP) are required to inform Amazon if content is AI-generated, but that information is not passed on to consumers.

        "Content": "\n          News correspondent\n              @esadiya\n  Fashion brand Topshop celebrated its relaunch with its first catwalk in seven years. The company's website promised everyone was invited as models strutted down a runway on Trafalgar Square in front of noughties fashion icons Cara Delevingne and Adwoa Aboah and the London Mayor Sir Sadiq Khan. The label has been operating on the online fashion platform ASOS after ceasing to operate as a standalone business in 2020. Its previous owner, Sir Philip Green's Arcadia group, collapsed into administration and all of Topshop's physical stores - including the Oxford Circus flagship in London's West End - closed soon after. Delevingne told Sky News she was \"totally blown away\" by the relaunch event. \"It was like nostalgia mixed with something eclectic but also something brand new,\" she said. \"For me, it really brings back a time of exploration of my own fashion sense because I think for me at Topshop I got to discover so much.\" The model, who is working on a capsule collection for next year, has already unveiled a choice edit in this year's show and said her relationship with Topshop precedes her fame. She said: \"I would go in and my friends would be like 'you would look good in that' and I would go 'no, that's not really me', and then you'd try it on and be like 'oh maybe I can explore more'. \"They really have everything for everyone, and I feel like they brought that back.\" The runway showcased highlights from its Autumn-Winter 2025 collection, as well as an early preview of pieces set to drop later this season, including showstopper gowns, the classic white tee, and an aloe vera-coloured faux fur coat that surely should not have been on display - to prevent just about everyone rushing to buy it. Reclaiming the high street But sharp tailoring and statement outerwear suggest the brand is ready to reclaim the high street. Must-have denim pieces completed the womenswear line-up while the Topman collection screamed modern utility by blending refined formal wear with sharp new silhouettes. Casual pieces are grounded by authentic denim in deep indigos, which stood out on Trafalgar Square's magnificent stone steps. Topshop's relaunch comes as the high street continues to struggle and as the UK operation of Chinese fashion giant Shein announced pre-tax profits of £38.3m for the year, up some £14m from 2023. 'Top end of the market' Moses Rashid, global marketing director at Topshop/Topman said they are competing in a different space. \"We're at the top end of the market. We're about elevation. We pride ourselves on the quality of the product,\" he said. Those products are being designed in north London, and managing director Michelle Wilson said the aim is to stay that way. \"We are a British brand, we want to be a positive force for fashion. We want to bring London to the world. It's fundamental to who we are as a brand, our style is very much London-driven.\" The majority Danish-owned company has suggested it will slow fashion down by opening physical stores where customers can touch the products, browse collections and try things on, though the flagship on Oxford Circus is unlikely to return because a Swedish fast furniture brand has since occupied the space. Designer Wayne Hemingway has previously collaborated with Topshop and said the relaunch must be more than nostalgia.

They can't rely on the past.\""
