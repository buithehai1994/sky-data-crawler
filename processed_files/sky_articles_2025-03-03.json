        "Content": " Donald Trump has paused US military aid to Ukraine just days after his row with President Zelenskyy. A White House official, speaking anonymously, said: \"President [Trump] has been clear that he is focused on peace. \"We need our partners to be committed to that goal as well. We are pausing and reviewing our aid to ensure that it is contributing to a solution.\" There was no indication about the possible length of the pause, and there's been no comment so far from Ukraine. It comes after the astonishing clash between the two leaders - as well as vice president Vance - in the Oval Office on Friday. Donald Trump's berating of Mr Zelenskyy has led to a show of support from European leaders as they try to formulate their own way forward. The US president attacked the Ukrainian leader again on Monday, telling reporters he should be \"more appreciative\". \n                  Donald Trump confirms Mexico and Canada tariffs - sending financial markets reeling\n                 \n                  America will not put up with it for much longer!': Donald Trump hits out at Ukraine's President Zelenskyy once again\n                 \n                  Lord Mandelson's claim Ukraine should commit to ceasefire before Russia 'not government policy', minister says\n                 Writing on Truth Social, Mr Trump also said Mr Zelenskyy had made \"the worst statement that could have been made\" after he commented that peace was still \"very, very far away\". \"America will not put up with it for much longer!\" he posted. \"It is what I was saying, this guy doesn't want there to be peace as long as he has America's backing,\" the president added. Mr Zelenskyy then posted on X, saying Ukraine was \"working together with America and our European partners and very much hope on US support on the path to peace\". \"Peace is needed as soon as possible,\" he said. By David Blevins, US correspondent President Trump's decision to pause military aid to Ukraine marks a significant shift in US foreign policy, one previously considered unthinkable. This blow to Ukraine's defences in the face of Russian aggression will be music to the ears of President Putin. US military aid has kept Ukraine in this David and Goliath battle for three years.\n It has funded what military analysts simplify as \"the big stuff\" of battle â€“ artillery, anti-tank weapons, rockets and armoured vehicles. Trumpâ€™s decision to push pause disregards efforts by Keir Starmer and other European leaders to devise a peace plan.\n Those already questioning Europe's reliance on the US for defence will conclude they have been given the answer.  But the decision sets President Trump up for a potential confrontation with Republicans, who had approved the funding, in Congress.\n White House sources say he wants President Zelenskyy to go on TV and apologise for the jaw-dropping showdown last Friday. But the Ukrainian president feels he has no apology to make for expressing his doubt about Russia's commitment to peace. Earlier, Trump side-stepped a question about a Kremlin diplomat claiming the US administration and Moscow were now aligned on foreign policy.\n This weakening of Ukraine's defence capability moves that question front and centre as he prepares to address Congress on Tuesday. Despite the diplomatic crisis, President Trump has said a deal is still possible. An agreement giving the US access to Ukraine's rare earth metals was meant to have been signed by the two presidents on Friday. It was billed as an important step in a future peace deal - and part payback for aid already received. However, the dramatic falling out has thrown that into jeopardy. Mr Zelenskyy wants the metals deal to include guarantees on halting Russia should it break the terms of any peace agreement. European allies - who met the Ukrainian leader in London on Sunday - are working up a \"coalition of the willing\" to deploy peacekeeping troops and deter further Russian aggression in the event of a ceasefire. The prime minister said Britain is prepared to put \"boots on the ground and planes in the air\" - but it's currently unclear who else might be involved.  Read more:Long-range drones 'weakening Russia's combat ability'Zelenskyy: 'I am exchangeable for NATO membership'The coalition that could secure peace in Ukraine Keir Starmer told MPs on Monday that Britain must \"lead from the front\" on supporting Ukraine and the \"security of our continent, the security of our country\". However, the prime minister believes any European deployment of troops must have a US \"backstop\" deterrent to be taken seriously by Russia.  America has given around â‚¬64bn of military aid to Ukraine, compared with â‚¬62bn from European nations (including Britain). The overall US total is â‚¬114bn and the European one â‚¬132bn. This includes humanitarian aid and other financial assistance to keep the country running. Following the weekend summit, the UK also pledged Â£1.6bn in finance for Ukraine to buy another 5,000 air defence missiles."

        "Content": "Donald Trump has confirmed 25% tariffs on goods from Mexico and Canada, taking effect at 5am UK time on Tuesday.  The US president confirmed the tariffs in a speech at the White House - and his announcement sent US stocks down sharply. The tariffs will be felt heavily by US companies which have factories in Canada and Mexico, such as carmakers. Mr Trump said: \"They're going to have a tariff. So what they have to do is build their car plants, frankly, and other things in the United States, in which case they have no tariffs.\" There's \"no room left\" for a deal that would see the tariffs shelved if fentanyl flowing into the US is curbed by its neighbours, he added. As of 12:01am Eastern Standard Time (5.01am GMT), Mexico and Canada face tariffs of 25%, with 10% for Canadian energy, the Trump administration confirmed. Canada announced it would retaliate immediately, imposing 25% tariffs on US imports worth C$30bn (Â£16.3bn).

        "Headline": "Sky News was given rare access to view a drone mission at a top-secret area in Ukraine. Long-range drone strikes targeting ammunition, weapons and fuel are making it \"significantly\" harder for Russia to conduct combat operations against Ukraine.",
        "Content": "By Deborah Haynes, security and defence editor, Katy Scholes, producer, and Azad Safarov, producer   Russia is finding it \"significantly\" harder to conduct combat operations against Ukraine because of a rise in Ukrainian long-range drone strikes on Russian weapons supplies, ammunition depots and fuel refineries, a senior commander has said. Brigadier General Yuriy Shchygol signalled these attacks would grow, revealing that his country plans to more than quadruple the production rate of deep strike drones - with a range of hundreds of miles - to more than 2,000 aircraft a month. Ukraine has been intensifying the tempo of its long-range drone strikes against targets inside Russia and Russian-occupied territory since late December - demonstrating what defence sources say is a world-leading capability that the Kremlin is struggling to counter. The mission is an example of how Kyiv remains focused on combatting Moscow's invasion even as world attention fixates on the fallout from a row between Donald Trump and Volodymyr Zelenskyy, as well as efforts by Europe to prepare a plan for peace. Live updates: Ukraine war latest The comments by Brigadier Shchygol, who coordinates long-range drone strikes for Ukraine's Defence Intelligence, offer a rare insight into the impact of the covert mission, which is also carried out by other branches of the Ukrainian military and security services. \"Russia is finding it increasingly difficult to conceal the extent of the damage,\" the commander told Sky News in an interview at an undisclosed location in Kyiv. \"Headquarters have been hit, command structures weakened, and panic is spreading among their officers. Compared to a year ago, conducting full-scale combat operations has become significantly more challenging for [the Russians].\" Sky News analysis of long-range drone strikes last month found that since December, there had been a ramping up of attacks against oil refineries in Russia that are used to fuel Russian tanks, jets and warships. The analysis took in strikes officially confirmed by the Ukrainian armed forces. Brigadier Shchygol said \"far more\" drone attacks by Ukraine are not publicly confirmed.  In a sign of the importance placed on long-range drones, he said Kyiv's ability to manufacture this weapon has already jumped 100-fold since late 2022 to more than 500 per month. While the officer would not say how many of these drones are then deployed on operations, he noted: \"Nothing is just sitting in storage unused.\" He said recent operations had targeted several storage sites for Russia's Iranian-designed Shahed one-way attack drones - used by the Russian armed forces against Ukrainian military and civilian targets. More than 3,000 Shahed unmanned aerial vehicles were destroyed, according to the officer, who said: \"As a result, their deployment of these drones has significantly decreased.\" Top secret drone mission Sky News was given rare access to view a drone mission last week at a top-secret area. As night fell, soldiers dressed in black - all members of the Defence Intelligence of Ukraine, an elite branch of the armed forces - prepared a line of about 10 drones. Each aircraft looked like a giant, grey metal mosquito. The model is called \"Lutti\", which is Ukrainian for \"Fury\". One by one, the drones burst into life, a propeller on the back whirring, pushing the aircraft forward at ever greater speed until it took off into the darkness. We were told their target was an ammunition depot inside Russia. \"Vector\", the commander on the ground, said his drones have a success rate of 70 to 80%. He said Ukraine's deep strike operations are \"very important\". \"We change the war with these drones,\" Vector said, speaking with a balaclava pulled up to his eyes to protect his identity. \"We can show [Russia] that the war can come in their houses, in their towns, cities.\" Russia's sheer size makes it vulnerable  Using drones to strike targets hundreds of miles inside Russia is a complex challenge. But the sheer size of their enemy's country works in Ukraine's favour. The Russian military has weapons sites, ammunition storage areas, oil refineries and military headquarters dotted across its territory and lacks the air defences to be able to protect them all. \"We are reaching those targets. The slowing pace of their offensives - and in some places, even Ukrainian counter-offensives reclaiming territory - proves that our strikes are effective and growing more so,\" Brigadier Shchygol said. Read more:Which countries could send peacekeeping troops to Ukraine?In the room with Volodymyr Zelenskyy A huge planning and reconnaissance effort underpins Ukraine's long-range drone strikes. It identifies targets and coordinates attacks between the different teams. Varying volumes of drones are required for each mission - with some of the most complex strikes needing 100 unmanned aircraft. From farm aircraft to fighter drone The brigadier was speaking in a large room inside a disused building in Kyiv where five examples of different Ukrainian long-range drones were on display. They tell the story of the evolution of vital battlefield technology that began life on a farm. The earliest form of the long-range drone looks like an ordinary light aircraft, with rectangular wings and two propellers. It is a lot smaller than a manned plane but much larger than a regular drone - probably about the length of a car, with a similar wingspan. This model, fitted with a camera and a large fuel tank to fly for long periods, had been used for surveillance for agricultural purposes. It was adapted after Russia's full-scale invasion to conduct reconnaissance and even bombing missions. The idea was then modified further to develop similar-sized drones that look more like fighter jets, with pointed noses and triangular wings. These were designed to hold explosives in the main body of the plane. Some of the drones are remotely piloted, others work via autopilot. Russia's war has forced Ukraine to use technology and innovation to fight back against its far more powerful foe. It has accelerated the use of autonomous machines in an irreversible transformation of the warzone that everyone is watching and learning from. Brigadier Shchygol said: \"Right now, Ukraine's battlefield experience is essentially a manual for the world.\""

        "Content": "\n          Political reporter\n              @alexrogerssky\n Jeremy Corbyn has urged Sir Keir Starmer to set up an independent Chilcot-style inquiry into the UK's involvement in Israel's war in Gaza. In a letter to the prime minister seen by Sky News, the former Labour leader argued there was public concern British officials had been implicated \"in the gravest breaches of international law\" because of decisions made by the government. Mr Corbyn, now the independent MP for Islington North, said he had repeatedly sought answers on the continued sale of components for F-35 jets to Israel, the role of British military bases and the legal definition of genocide - but had been met with \"evasion, obstruction and silence\". As a result, the government was \"leaving the public in the dark over the ways in which the responsibilities of government have been discharged\", Mr Corbyn argued. Politics latest: Zelenskyy was 'rude' to Trump, says Farage 'History is repeating itself' Drawing parallels with the Chilcot inquiry into the Iraq War - which found the UK's decision to invade was based on \"flawed intelligence and assessments\" - Mr Corbyn said \"history is repeating itself\". The Chilcot report, which was published in 2016 following a series of delays, criticised former Labour prime minister Sir Tony Blair for not consulting his cabinet before giving George W Bush assurances the UK would be with him \"whatever\", eight months before the invasion began. It also said the circumstances leading up to the then attorney general's controversial advice that the war was legal - without a second UN resolution - were \"far from satisfactory\". In his letter, Mr Corbyn said \"many people believe the government has taken decisions that have implicated officials in the gravest breaches of international law\". \"These charges will not go away until there is a comprehensive, public, independent inquiry with the legal power to establish the truth,\" he added. The Islington MP, who was suspended from the parliamentary Labour Party in 2020 in a row over antisemitism and later blocked from standing as one of its general election candidates, said in the interests of \"transparency and accountability\" he would be \"working with colleagues in pursuing all avenues to establish an independent inquiry\". \"Today, the death toll in Gaza has exceeded 61,000,\" he said, referring to figures that include people who are missing and presumed dead. According to the Hamas-run health ministry, Israel's assault on Gaza has killed more than 48,000 Palestinians. It does not distinguish between civilians and combatants in this count. Mr Corbyn continued: \"At least 110,000 - or one in twenty - people have been injured. It is estimated that 92% of housing units have been destroyed or damaged. \"Two Israeli officials are now wanted by the International Criminal Court (ICC) for war crimes and crimes against humanity.\" These officials are Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and former defence secretary Yoav Gallant. Mr Netanyahu's office rejected the ICC warrants against him and Mr Gallant as \"antisemitic\" and said Israel \"rejects with disgust the absurd and false actions\". Referring to the October 7 attack that triggered Israel's invasion of Gaza, Mr Netanyahu said: \"With what audacity do you compare Hamas that murdered, burned, butchered, decapitated, raped and kidnapped our brothers and sisters and the IDF soldiers fighting a just war?\" While in opposition, Sir Keir struggled to contain divisions within Labour when Israel began its incursion into Gaza following the Hamas terrorist attack that killed 1,200 Israelis and saw about 250 taken hostage. The Labour leader drew criticism for an interview he gave to LBC in which he appeared to suggest that Israel had a right to limit essential supplies, including water and electricity, to Gaza. He later said he was only referring to the right Israel had to defend itself. Arms sales to Israel Last April, under Conservative prime minister Rishi Sunak, the government was warned it was breaching international law by continuing to arm Israel and faced calls to suspend arms exports to the country after three British aid workers were killed in an airstrike. Months later, the newly elected Labour government announced it would suspend some arms sales to Israel, following a review of export licences which found there was a \"clear risk\" they might be used to commit \"a serious violation of international humanitarian law\". While the UK does not directly supply Israel with weapons, it does grant export licences for British companies to sell arms to the country.  The suspension covered components that go into military aircraft that have been used in Gaza, including helicopters and drones, as well as items which facilitate ground targeting. But it did not include parts for multinational F-35 fighter jets - something that has concerned opposition MPs and human rights charities. In response, Mr Netanyahu said the decision was \"shameful\" and \"will not change Israel's determination to defeat Hamas, a genocidal terrorist organization that savagely murdered 1200 people on October 7, including 14 British citizens\".  Read more:Which countries could send troops to Ukraine?Israel stops all goods and supplies into Gaza Defining genocide Sir Keir, a former public prosecutor and human rights barrister, has also faced pressure to share his legal definition of genocide following questioning from an independent MP in the Commons. The prime minister told the Commons he was \"well aware of the definition of genocide, and that is why I have never described this as, and referred to it as, genocide\". Middle East and North Africa minister Hamish Falconer later told Mr Corbyn in a letter that it was the government's \"long-standing policy\" that \"any determination that genocide has occurred is a matter for a competent national or international court, not for governments or non-judicial bodies\". \"This approach ensures that any determination is above politics, lobbying and individual or national interest,\" he said. A Government spokesperson said: \"Our priority since day one has been a sustainable ceasefire, and a lasting peace that will ensure the long-term peace and security of both Palestinians and Israelis. \"We must build confidence on all sides that helps sustain the ceasefire and move it from phase one through to phase three, and into a lasting peace and an end to the suffering on all sides.\""

The state's interior minister Thomas Strobl said a 40-year-old man from the nearby state of Rhineland-Palatinate had been detained. \"As far as the specific motivation of the crime is concerned, we have no indication of an extremist or religious background at the moment,\" he said. Police spokesperson Stefan Wilhelm said the incident unfolded on Monday at around 12.15pm local time in a pedestrianised part of Mannheim's Paradeplatz area. Armed police and forensic investigators were seen examining a black vehicle with smashed windows near the city's Rhine bridge. Local officials added that the State Criminal Police Office (LKA) would be leading the investigation in cooperation with the Mannheim Public Prosecutor's Office.

An alert was issued on the Katwarn smartphone app - used in major emergencies - telling people in Mannheim to avoid the city centre due to a big police deployment. Earlier Mannheim University Hospital said it was prepared for a possible \"mass casualty incident\", implementing its disaster and emergency plan, and increasing intensive care capacity, according to German news agency DPA. A total of eight trauma teams have been made available - for both adults and children, according to the agency. \"Postponable operations that had not yet begun were immediately removed from the operation plan in order to create additional operating capacity,\" the hospital said in a statement. Crowds have been gathering in cities across Germany, including its Rhineland region, for parades to mark the country's carnival season. Police were on high alert after social media accounts connected to Islamic extremist groups called for attacks on events planned in Cologne and Nuremberg. Today's incident follows other similar ones in recent weeks, including a deadly car attack at a Christmas market in Magdeburg in December and another in Munich last month. Mannheim has a population of 326,000 people and is around 50 miles south of Frankfurt."

        "Content": "Two men have been convicted of a series of sexual offences against two teenage girls, who were described by the gang targeting them as \"fresh meat\".  Sheffield Crown Court was told the girls were sexually assaulted several times a week over a period of six months in the South Yorkshire town of Rotherham more than 10 years ago. The prosecution described the teenagers as \"powerless to prevent the actions of older and more mature individuals determined to exploit them for sexual purposes\". On Monday, Romulad Stefan Houphouet, 37, and Absolom Sigiyo, 41, were found guilty of a number of offences including rape. A third defendant, Jacek Brzozowski, 35, was cleared of inciting a child to engage in sexual activity but admitted penetrative sexual activity with a child. During a five-week trial, prosecutor Gordon Stables told a jury both the complainants were living in a children's home when they were befriended by the defendants \"and also other associates\" in Rotherham town centre more than a decade ago. Mr Stables said the men knew their victims were under the age of consent and \"gained the girls' trust and confidence by plying them with alcohol and giving them cigarettes at house parties, and offering them flirtatious attention\". He said: \"Both girls became conditioned to having regular sexual intercourse... the clear pre-meditated intention was to ensure that the girls entered into and remained in a state of compliance. \"Psychologically, the girls were made to feel that sexual activity was how they repaid the debt they owed the defendants for the provision of alcohol and tobacco. \"Once the males were sexually satisfied, however, the girls were treated as having served their purpose - at least temporarily - and they were often then ignored and expected to make their own way home.\" \"In this way, [the girls] were sexually groomed within an environment of dependency,\" he said, adding that the men referred to them as \"fresh meat\". Ivorian national Houphouet, of Burngreave in Sheffield, and Sigiyo, a Zimbabwean national of Catcliffe in Rotherham, will be sentenced on Wednesday. Polish national Brzozowski, of Rawmarsh in Rotherham, was bailed and is being sentenced on 14 April. Read more from Sky News:Elon Musk and the grooming gangs scandalCourt backlogs delay Rotherham rape trialChair of child abuse inquiry criticises MPs Senior investigating officer Kath Blain said: \"This is one of the most harrowing cases I have investigated. Sigiyo and Houphouet lured two vulnerable girls to parties where they kept the children intoxicated so they could abuse them in the worst ways. \"Brzozwski contributed to their suffering, including by having sex with one of the girls who he knew was a child and vulnerable. The victims have shown extraordinary bravery in reporting their abuse.\" The convictions are the latest following the National Crime Agency's (NCA) investigation, called Operation Stovewood, which has identified more than 1,100 victims of child sexual exploitation in Rotherham between 1997 and 2013. It was established after the landmark Jay Report, which found that hundreds of girls had been abused by gangs of men of mainly Pakistani heritage in the town. Martin McRobb, specialist prosecutor for the Crown Prosecution Service, said: \"The victims in this case are now adults, but they have had to live with the trauma caused by the vile and serious sexual offences committed against them in their youth. \"We know it can be difficult to talk about such abuse, and I would like to extend my thanks to the victims for the courage and fortitude they showed in coming forward and giving evidence against these men.\""

        "Content": "A man has pleaded guilty to killing seven people when he opened fire on an Independence Day parade in Chicago in 2022.  Robert E Crimo III, 24, had pleaded not guilty to the shooting - but changed his plea just moments before opening statements at his trial. Prosecutors originally charged Crimo with 21 counts of first-degree murder, three for each person killed, and 48 counts of attempted murder. They dropped 48 less serious counts of aggravated battery before jury selection last week. Judge Victoria Rossetti read the charges to Crimo and asked questions to ensure he understood before his new plea was read to the court today in Lake County, Illinois. He mostly gave one-word answers and indicated he understood the charges. The plea change means the trial - which had been expected to last a month - will not go ahead, the judge told the court. \n                  Donald Trump pauses US military aid to Ukraine\n                 \n                  Donald Trump confirms Mexico and Canada tariffs - sending financial markets reeling\n                 \n                  Ukraine war latest: Trump warns Zelenskyy but says minerals deal not dead; Russian oil pipeline 'on fire'\n                 \"He has knowingly and voluntarily waived those rights and pleaded guilty,\" Rossetti said. The proceedings were briefly interrupted as the defendant's mother had a brief outburst at her son's plea change. She was called to the bench and given a warning but allowed to stay in the courtroom. Crimo will be sentenced on 23 April and is certain to spend the rest of his life behind bars as each first-degree murder count carries a natural life prison sentence.  The change of plea shocked those in the courtroom and Ashbey Beasley, who attended the 2022 parade with her son, said it was a huge relief. Ms Beasley and her son had to run for their lives, she said, and while they were not injured, they have needed to heal. \"Every single time I see [Crimo], it's stressful,\" she told reporters. \"It's upsetting for everyone in our community,\" she told reporters after court. \"We all just wanted this to be over.\" Read more:Crimo's violent online trailDad hid son in bin as shooting unfolded In a Chicago suburb around 30 miles north of the city, Crimo perched on a roof and fired into crowds gathered for a Fourth of July parade in 2022, authorities said.

The seven people killed in the shooting included an 88-year-old man and a married couple. The dozens injured ranged in age from an eight-year-old boy, who was left partially paralysed, to someone in their eighties."

        "Content": "\n          Political reporter\n              @alexrogerssky\n Jeremy Corbyn has urged Sir Keir Starmer to set up an independent Chilcot-style inquiry into the UK's involvement in Israel's war in Gaza. In a letter to the prime minister seen by Sky News, the former Labour leader argued there was public concern British officials had been implicated \"in the gravest breaches of international law\" because of decisions made by the government. Mr Corbyn, now the independent MP for Islington North, said he had repeatedly sought answers on the continued sale of components for F-35 jets to Israel, the role of British military bases and the legal definition of genocide - but had been met with \"evasion, obstruction and silence\". As a result, the government was \"leaving the public in the dark over the ways in which the responsibilities of government have been discharged\", Mr Corbyn argued. Politics latest: Zelenskyy was 'rude' to Trump, says Farage 'History is repeating itself' Drawing parallels with the Chilcot inquiry into the Iraq War - which found the UK's decision to invade was based on \"flawed intelligence and assessments\" - Mr Corbyn said \"history is repeating itself\". The Chilcot report, which was published in 2016 following a series of delays, criticised former Labour prime minister Sir Tony Blair for not consulting his cabinet before giving George W Bush assurances the UK would be with him \"whatever\", eight months before the invasion began. It also said the circumstances leading up to the then attorney general's controversial advice that the war was legal - without a second UN resolution - were \"far from satisfactory\". In his letter, Mr Corbyn said \"many people believe the government has taken decisions that have implicated officials in the gravest breaches of international law\". \"These charges will not go away until there is a comprehensive, public, independent inquiry with the legal power to establish the truth,\" he added. The Islington MP, who was suspended from the parliamentary Labour Party in 2020 in a row over antisemitism and later blocked from standing as one of its general election candidates, said in the interests of \"transparency and accountability\" he would be \"working with colleagues in pursuing all avenues to establish an independent inquiry\". \"Today, the death toll in Gaza has exceeded 61,000,\" he said, referring to figures that include people who are missing and presumed dead. According to the Hamas-run health ministry, Israel's assault on Gaza has killed more than 48,000 Palestinians. It does not distinguish between civilians and combatants in this count. Mr Corbyn continued: \"At least 110,000 - or one in twenty - people have been injured. It is estimated that 92% of housing units have been destroyed or damaged. \"Two Israeli officials are now wanted by the International Criminal Court (ICC) for war crimes and crimes against humanity.\" These officials are Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and former defence secretary Yoav Gallant. Mr Netanyahu's office rejected the ICC warrants against him and Mr Gallant as \"antisemitic\" and said Israel \"rejects with disgust the absurd and false actions\". Referring to the October 7 attack that triggered Israel's invasion of Gaza, Mr Netanyahu said: \"With what audacity do you compare Hamas that murdered, burned, butchered, decapitated, raped and kidnapped our brothers and sisters and the IDF soldiers fighting a just war?\" While in opposition, Sir Keir struggled to contain divisions within Labour when Israel began its incursion into Gaza following the Hamas terrorist attack that killed 1,200 Israelis and saw about 250 taken hostage. The Labour leader drew criticism for an interview he gave to LBC in which he appeared to suggest that Israel had a right to limit essential supplies, including water and electricity, to Gaza. He later said he was only referring to the right Israel had to defend itself. Arms sales to Israel Last April, under Conservative prime minister Rishi Sunak, the government was warned it was breaching international law by continuing to arm Israel and faced calls to suspend arms exports to the country after three British aid workers were killed in an airstrike. Months later, the newly elected Labour government announced it would suspend some arms sales to Israel, following a review of export licences which found there was a \"clear risk\" they might be used to commit \"a serious violation of international humanitarian law\". While the UK does not directly supply Israel with weapons, it does grant export licences for British companies to sell arms to the country.  The suspension covered components that go into military aircraft that have been used in Gaza, including helicopters and drones, as well as items which facilitate ground targeting. But it did not include parts for multinational F-35 fighter jets - something that has concerned opposition MPs and human rights charities. In response, Mr Netanyahu said the decision was \"shameful\" and \"will not change Israel's determination to defeat Hamas, a genocidal terrorist organization that savagely murdered 1200 people on October 7, including 14 British citizens\".  Read more:Which countries could send troops to Ukraine?Israel stops all goods and supplies into Gaza Defining genocide Sir Keir, a former public prosecutor and human rights barrister, has also faced pressure to share his legal definition of genocide following questioning from an independent MP in the Commons. The prime minister told the Commons he was \"well aware of the definition of genocide, and that is why I have never described this as, and referred to it as, genocide\". Middle East and North Africa minister Hamish Falconer later told Mr Corbyn in a letter that it was the government's \"long-standing policy\" that \"any determination that genocide has occurred is a matter for a competent national or international court, not for governments or non-judicial bodies\". \"This approach ensures that any determination is above politics, lobbying and individual or national interest,\" he said. A Government spokesperson said: \"Our priority since day one has been a sustainable ceasefire, and a lasting peace that will ensure the long-term peace and security of both Palestinians and Israelis. \"We must build confidence on all sides that helps sustain the ceasefire and move it from phase one through to phase three, and into a lasting peace and an end to the suffering on all sides.\""

        "Content": "\n          Wales reporter\n              @TomosGruffydd\n A man has been jailed for life for murdering his son's girlfriend after she returned home from the school run. Officers from Dyfed-Powys Police were called to an address on Bigyn Road in Llanelli, Carmarthenshire, on 5 July last year. Sophie Evans, 30, had sustained 72 separate injuries on the outside of the body, \"all but three of them new injuries\". Richard Jones, who is now 50, believed he was \"being taken advantage of financially\" by Ms Evans and his son, with whom she was in a relationship. While the purpose of Jones's visit was \"purely normal\", he confronted her on that morning about his suspicions and Ms Evans's reaction was such that Jones \"lost [his] temper\". He subjected Ms Evans to \"gross violence\" before ultimately strangling her and leaving the property to run errands, including ordering a new bank card and buying pastries from a bakery. 'Last time on their school run' During sentencing on Monday, the defendant kept his head bowed for most of the hearing. He will have to serve at least 20 years behind bars before he can be considered for release by the parole board. Swansea Crown Court heard Ms Evans was the mother of two young children. Passing his sentence, Judge Geraint Walters said Ms Evans \"had just taken her two children for the last time on their school run\" prior to the attack. \"She wasn't to know that when she parted company with them that morning,\" he added. The court heard Jones believed he was being defrauded by Ms Evans and his son. \"There is clear evidence, that in the days leading up to this, that you had begun harbouring thoughts that Sophie Evans and your own son were in fact financially scamming you,\" he said. \"What precisely brought about that view is difficult to determine.\" Judge Walters said Jones \"lost [his] temper when [he] didn't get the answer that [he] thought [he] deserved\". He added that, having lost his temper, the defendant \"subjected [Ms Evans] to gross violence over a period of time, before you ultimately extinguished her life by strangulation\". The court was told in evidence that at the time of the attack, Ms Evans was wearing only a bath towel. 'The rock of our family' In a victim personal statement, Ms Evans's sister Kerry Quinlan told the court she was \"the rock of our family\". She said Ms Evans was taken from them in a \"senseless and cruel act\". \"Words cannot express fully how much of a loss this has been to her children,\" she added. \"When they cry themselves to sleep wanting their mum, she isn't there and never will be.\" Ms Quinlan added that Jones had \"taken everything from us, all in the most despicable way possible\". Read more from Sky News:Human skeletal remains found near retail parkPolice operation in centre of German city Ms Evans's partner at the time, and the defendant's son, Jamie Davies, said in a victim personal statement, read on his behalf, that they had both \"trusted\" Jones, and that Ms Evans had even been planning the defendant's 50th birthday. \"The thought of having to live my life without Sophie causes me extreme pain and heartache,\" he added. Prosecuting, Michael Jones KC said the offence was aggravated by the defendant's previous convictions and the fact Ms Evans was murdered in her home. In mitigation, David Elias KC said there was a \"lack of premeditation\"."

        "Content": "Two men have been convicted of a series of sexual offences against two teenage girls, who were described by the gang targeting them as \"fresh meat\".  Sheffield Crown Court was told the girls were sexually assaulted several times a week over a period of six months in the South Yorkshire town of Rotherham more than 10 years ago. The prosecution described the teenagers as \"powerless to prevent the actions of older and more mature individuals determined to exploit them for sexual purposes\". On Monday, Romulad Stefan Houphouet, 37, and Absolom Sigiyo, 41, were found guilty of a number of offences including rape. A third defendant, Jacek Brzozowski, 35, was cleared of inciting a child to engage in sexual activity but admitted penetrative sexual activity with a child. During a five-week trial, prosecutor Gordon Stables told a jury both the complainants were living in a children's home when they were befriended by the defendants \"and also other associates\" in Rotherham town centre more than a decade ago. Mr Stables said the men knew their victims were under the age of consent and \"gained the girls' trust and confidence by plying them with alcohol and giving them cigarettes at house parties, and offering them flirtatious attention\". He said: \"Both girls became conditioned to having regular sexual intercourse... the clear pre-meditated intention was to ensure that the girls entered into and remained in a state of compliance. \"Psychologically, the girls were made to feel that sexual activity was how they repaid the debt they owed the defendants for the provision of alcohol and tobacco. \"Once the males were sexually satisfied, however, the girls were treated as having served their purpose - at least temporarily - and they were often then ignored and expected to make their own way home.\" \"In this way, [the girls] were sexually groomed within an environment of dependency,\" he said, adding that the men referred to them as \"fresh meat\". Ivorian national Houphouet, of Burngreave in Sheffield, and Sigiyo, a Zimbabwean national of Catcliffe in Rotherham, will be sentenced on Wednesday. Polish national Brzozowski, of Rawmarsh in Rotherham, was bailed and is being sentenced on 14 April. Read more from Sky News:Elon Musk and the grooming gangs scandalCourt backlogs delay Rotherham rape trialChair of child abuse inquiry criticises MPs Senior investigating officer Kath Blain said: \"This is one of the most harrowing cases I have investigated. Sigiyo and Houphouet lured two vulnerable girls to parties where they kept the children intoxicated so they could abuse them in the worst ways. \"Brzozwski contributed to their suffering, including by having sex with one of the girls who he knew was a child and vulnerable. The victims have shown extraordinary bravery in reporting their abuse.\" The convictions are the latest following the National Crime Agency's (NCA) investigation, called Operation Stovewood, which has identified more than 1,100 victims of child sexual exploitation in Rotherham between 1997 and 2013. It was established after the landmark Jay Report, which found that hundreds of girls had been abused by gangs of men of mainly Pakistani heritage in the town. Martin McRobb, specialist prosecutor for the Crown Prosecution Service, said: \"The victims in this case are now adults, but they have had to live with the trauma caused by the vile and serious sexual offences committed against them in their youth. \"We know it can be difficult to talk about such abuse, and I would like to extend my thanks to the victims for the courage and fortitude they showed in coming forward and giving evidence against these men.\""

        "Content": "Renowned Scottish painter Jack Vettriano has died at the age of 73, his publicist has said. The artist was found dead at his apartment in Nice, in the south of France, on Saturday. It is understood there are no suspicious circumstances around his death. Vettriano was born Jack Hoggan on 17 November 1951 in Methil, Fife. He left school at the age of 15 to become a mining engineer but took up painting after a girlfriend gifted him a box of watercolours for his 21st birthday. The self-taught artist learned his craft by copying old masters, impressionists, surrealists and a plethora of Scottish artists. He drew inspiration from works at Kirkcaldy Galleries, studying paintings from artists such as Samuel Peploe and William McTaggart so intently that he feared arousing the suspicions of gallery staff. His breakthrough came in 1998 when he submitted two paintings to the Royal Scottish Academy's annual show and both sold on the first day, inspiring him to become a full-time artist. Vettriano's works garnered international acclaim, leading to exhibitions in cities such as Edinburgh, London, Hong Kong, Johannesburg and New York. His 1992 painting The Singing Butler is among his most famed work, becoming a best-selling image in Britain. It shows an elegant couple dancing on a storm-swept beach accompanied by their butler and maid. In 2004, the painting sold at auction for Â£744,800 - a record at the time for any Scottish painting and for any painting ever sold in Scotland. Read more from Sky News:Oscars 2025: The full list of winning films and starsThe Oscars moments everyone's talking about Among those to have acquired Vettriano paintings are Hollywood legend Jack Nicholson, former Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson, songwriter Sir Tim Rice, and late Harry Potter actor Robbie Coltrane. His publicist said in a statement: \"Jack Vettriano's passing marks the end of an era for contemporary Scottish art. \"His evocative and timeless works will continue to captivate and inspire future generations.\" Scotland's First Minister John Swinney was among those to pay tribute to Vettriano. He said: \"I am very sorry to hear that one of Scotland's best-known artists, Jack Vettriano, has died, and I want to express my deepest condolences to his family. \"From humble beginnings as a self-taught artist from Methil, Jack made a unique and evocative contribution to artistic life in Scotland, rising to become a household name thanks to iconic paintings like The Singing Butler, which has graced the walls of homes and galleries around the world. \"Born and raised in Fife, much of his early exposure to art came from the Kirkcaldy Galleries, so it was fitting that some of his earliest works were exhibited there in recent years. \"Jack was also a philanthropist for a number of important causes and I know his loss will be sorely felt by many across Scotland and the world.\" In a post on social media, Scottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar said: \"Very sad news. Jack Vettriano was an iconic Scottish artist. My thoughts are with his family and friends.\""

        "Content": "Former Barclays boss Jes Staley has begun a legal bid to overturn a ban from the UK's financial services industry, related to his links to the disgraced financier Jeffrey Epstein. The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) proposed the leadership ban in 2023, alongside a Â£1.8m fine, finding that Mr Staley had made misleading statements about his relationship with Epstein in correspondence with the watchdog. Mr Staley's barrister told the Upper Tribunal in a written statement that Mr Staley, who had quit his job at Barclays in 2021 to contest the FCA's findings, admits a \"close professional relationship\" with Epstein but denies they were friends. Money latest: Don't fall for this 'Apple charger' trick Their association dates back to a time when Epstein was a client of JPMorgan Chase's private bank, which Mr Staley headed before taking the role at Barclays in 2015. The FCA's ruling related to the contents of a letter sent by the then Barclays chairman in 2019, but reviewed by Mr Staley, which summarised the depth of the two men's ties in response to a request for \"assurance\" from the regulator. The watchdog determined it contained two misleading statements over their relationship, namely over how close they were and that Mr Staley's last contact with Epstein was \"well before he joined Barclays in 2015\". \n                  Sick pay boost for 1.3 million lowest-paid workers\n                 \n                  Arms firms across Europe worth billions more amid talk of Ukraine defence pact\n                 \n                  Money blog: 'Apple charger' trick exposed; Vodafone taking on Musk; state pension top-up deadline relaxed\n                 The FCA further found that they maintained contact through Mr Staley's daughter up to at least February 2017. Its barrister, Leigh-Ann Mulcahy KC, said in her written opening submission that he acted \"recklessly and without integrity\" by allowing the letter to be sent with the misleading statements. \"Mr Staley has consistently mis-stated the nature of his relationship with Mr Epstein, in particular downplaying thecloseness and extent of their connection, and the time they ceased contact,\" she added. The FCA's case includes more than 1,000 emails between the pair, some provided by JPMorgan andothers from Epstein's estate, in which Staley was said to have described their friendship as \"profound\" and referred to Epstein as \"family\". \"While the origin of the relationship was professional, it evolved into a personal relationship,\" the barrister said. Epstein killed himself in a New York jail cell in 2019 while awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges. In addition to his proposed FCA fine, Mr Staley missed out on pay and bonus awards above Â£18m after he left Barclays under a cloud. Mr Staley's barrister, Robert Smith KC, argued the letter sent by Barclays chair Nigel Higgins to the FCA was \"intended to achieve only one purpose, which was to inform the (FCA) that neither Mr Staley nor Barclays had had anyknowledge of or involvement in Mr Epstein's unlawful conduct\". He added that the letter was not meant to give a full account of their interactions. Mr Staley is expected to give evidence to the hearing in London next week. The Upper Tribunal is also expected to hear from Bank of England governor Andrew Bailey, who was in charge of the FCA between 2016 and 2020."

        "Content": "\n          Business and economics reporter\n              @SkyNewsBiz\n Around 1.3 million people on low wages are to secure guaranteed sick pay for the first time in a bid to boost health and living standards, the government has announced. Those earning less than Â£123 a week on average will be entitled to a sick pay equivalent of 80% of their weekly salary or the new rate of statutory sick pay (SSP) - due to rise to Â£118.75 per week in April. Employers will have to pay whatever the lowest sum is under a compromise achieved following discussions with business leaders - already reeling from a looming hike to minimum wage and employer national insurance contributions announced in October's budget. Money latest: Vodafone taking on Musk The new sick pay policy is expected to take effect next year but, crucially, it will apply from the first day of sickness rather than after the third consecutive day. The government argues that the measure will keep more people off benefits and leave some up to Â£100 better off per week because they will remain in employment. Work and Pensions Secretary Liz Kendall said: \"For too long, sick workers have had to decide between staying at home and losing a day's pay, or soldiering on at their own risk just to make ends meet. \n                  Arms firms across Europe worth billions more amid talk of Ukraine defence pact\n                 \n                  Money blog: 'Apple charger' trick exposed; Vodafone taking on Musk; state pension top-up deadline relaxed\n                 \n                  Crypto prices rally after Trump names Bitcoin and others for US strategic reserve\n                 \"No one should ever have to choose between their health and earning a living, which is why we are making this landmark change. \"The new rate is good for workers and fair on businesses as part of our plan to boost rights and make work pay, while delivering our plan for change.\" Unions had argued for an even higher figure.  The British Chambers of Commerce welcomed the outcome of the talks but said its members were still set to face further additional costs arising from the policy shift - on top of the budget measures due to take effect this April. Jane Gratton, its deputy director of public policy, said: \"Employers often struggle to find shift cover at short notice, leading to disruption for customers. \"The government's impact assessment did not produce compelling evidence on the day-one rights issue, so there may yet be unforeseen consequences.\" The announcement was made as MPs debate the wider employment rights Bill amid reports the government could drop its commitment to a 'right to switch off' outside of working hours. The Sunday Times also reported at the weekend that a series of amendments was likely to be tabled by ministers as part of government efforts to keep business sweet following a brutal backlash to the budget. Business groups have argued that the Â£25bn annual hit from the employment tax measures will result in job cuts, poor pay awards and weaker investment - hitting the government's growth agenda. Rachel Suff, wellbeing adviser at the HR body CIPD, said of the additional sick pay plans: \"Phasing in elements of the Employment Rights Bill and ensuring sufficient support and guidance for employers will be vital to making sure these measures work for employers and employees.\""

        "Content": "By Deborah Haynes, security and defence editor, Katy Scholes, producer, and Azad Safarov, producer   Russia is finding it \"significantly\" harder to conduct combat operations against Ukraine because of a rise in Ukrainian long-range drone strikes on Russian weapons supplies, ammunition depots and fuel refineries, a senior commander has said. Brigadier General Yuriy Shchygol signalled these attacks would grow, revealing that his country plans to more than quadruple the production rate of deep strike drones - with a range of hundreds of miles - to more than 2,000 aircraft a month. Ukraine has been intensifying the tempo of its long-range drone strikes against targets inside Russia and Russian-occupied territory since late December - demonstrating what defence sources say is a world-leading capability that the Kremlin is struggling to counter. The mission is an example of how Kyiv remains focused on combatting Moscow's invasion even as world attention fixates on the fallout from a row between Donald Trump and Volodymyr Zelenskyy, as well as efforts by Europe to prepare a plan for peace. Live updates: Ukraine war latest The comments by Brigadier Shchygol, who coordinates long-range drone strikes for Ukraine's Defence Intelligence, offer a rare insight into the impact of the covert mission, which is also carried out by other branches of the Ukrainian military and security services. \"Russia is finding it increasingly difficult to conceal the extent of the damage,\" the commander told Sky News in an interview at an undisclosed location in Kyiv. \"Headquarters have been hit, command structures weakened, and panic is spreading among their officers. Compared to a year ago, conducting full-scale combat operations has become significantly more challenging for [the Russians].\" Sky News analysis of long-range drone strikes last month found that since December, there had been a ramping up of attacks against oil refineries in Russia that are used to fuel Russian tanks, jets and warships. The analysis took in strikes officially confirmed by the Ukrainian armed forces. Brigadier Shchygol said \"far more\" drone attacks by Ukraine are not publicly confirmed.  In a sign of the importance placed on long-range drones, he said Kyiv's ability to manufacture this weapon has already jumped 100-fold since late 2022 to more than 500 per month. While the officer would not say how many of these drones are then deployed on operations, he noted: \"Nothing is just sitting in storage unused.\" He said recent operations had targeted several storage sites for Russia's Iranian-designed Shahed one-way attack drones - used by the Russian armed forces against Ukrainian military and civilian targets. More than 3,000 Shahed unmanned aerial vehicles were destroyed, according to the officer, who said: \"As a result, their deployment of these drones has significantly decreased.\" Top secret drone mission Sky News was given rare access to view a drone mission last week at a top-secret area. As night fell, soldiers dressed in black - all members of the Defence Intelligence of Ukraine, an elite branch of the armed forces - prepared a line of about 10 drones. Each aircraft looked like a giant, grey metal mosquito. The model is called \"Lutti\", which is Ukrainian for \"Fury\". One by one, the drones burst into life, a propeller on the back whirring, pushing the aircraft forward at ever greater speed until it took off into the darkness. We were told their target was an ammunition depot inside Russia. \"Vector\", the commander on the ground, said his drones have a success rate of 70 to 80%. He said Ukraine's deep strike operations are \"very important\". \"We change the war with these drones,\" Vector said, speaking with a balaclava pulled up to his eyes to protect his identity. \"We can show [Russia] that the war can come in their houses, in their towns, cities.\" Russia's sheer size makes it vulnerable  Using drones to strike targets hundreds of miles inside Russia is a complex challenge. But the sheer size of their enemy's country works in Ukraine's favour. The Russian military has weapons sites, ammunition storage areas, oil refineries and military headquarters dotted across its territory and lacks the air defences to be able to protect them all. \"We are reaching those targets. The slowing pace of their offensives - and in some places, even Ukrainian counter-offensives reclaiming territory - proves that our strikes are effective and growing more so,\" Brigadier Shchygol said. Read more:Which countries could send peacekeeping troops to Ukraine?In the room with Volodymyr Zelenskyy A huge planning and reconnaissance effort underpins Ukraine's long-range drone strikes. It identifies targets and coordinates attacks between the different teams. Varying volumes of drones are required for each mission - with some of the most complex strikes needing 100 unmanned aircraft. From farm aircraft to fighter drone The brigadier was speaking in a large room inside a disused building in Kyiv where five examples of different Ukrainian long-range drones were on display. They tell the story of the evolution of vital battlefield technology that began life on a farm. The earliest form of the long-range drone looks like an ordinary light aircraft, with rectangular wings and two propellers. It is a lot smaller than a manned plane but much larger than a regular drone - probably about the length of a car, with a similar wingspan. This model, fitted with a camera and a large fuel tank to fly for long periods, had been used for surveillance for agricultural purposes. It was adapted after Russia's full-scale invasion to conduct reconnaissance and even bombing missions. The idea was then modified further to develop similar-sized drones that look more like fighter jets, with pointed noses and triangular wings. These were designed to hold explosives in the main body of the plane. Some of the drones are remotely piloted, others work via autopilot. Russia's war has forced Ukraine to use technology and innovation to fight back against its far more powerful foe. It has accelerated the use of autonomous machines in an irreversible transformation of the warzone that everyone is watching and learning from. Brigadier Shchygol said: \"Right now, Ukraine's battlefield experience is essentially a manual for the world.\""

        "Headline": "The idea is being led by the UK and France, two of the most powerful militaries in Europe, but questions remain over who else could be involved. What about Germany, Poland and Italy? ",
        "Content": "\n          Foreign news reporter\n              @MikeRDrummond\n  A \"coalition of the willing\" could provide boots on the ground in Ukraine in the event of a ceasefire.Â  The phrase was a central theme of Sir Keir Starmer's speech after European leaders gathered in London for crucial talks about Ukraine's future. Led by the UK and France, the initiative could see troops from a number of European and NATO countries deployed to Ukraine as peacekeepers in order to deter Vladimir Putin from rearming and attacking again in the future. Follow latest: Russia not ready to negotiate, Zelenskyy says Sir Keir said Europe \"must do the heavy lifting\" on defence and indicated several countries had expressed interest in being part of the coalition. So who's in, who's out - and what's behind these latest buzzwords? What is a coalition of the willing? The prime minister has said the UK, France and Ukraine will work together on a peace deal that could be presented to the US. The countries committed to working together on this deal would form a \"coalition of the willing\". Countries in the coalition could end up sending soldiers to act as peacekeepers in Ukraine in the event of a ceasefire. Military analyst Michael Clarke said: \"It has to be a coalition of the willing because you have at least two NATO members - Slovakia and Hungary - who are vetoing anything that Putin would not like... it's the same with the EU.\" This approach would allow NATO members to act in a group but not under the NATO umbrella, avoiding vetoes from member states who don't approve or don't wish to be involved. Sir Keir's choice of the term \"coalition of the willing\" is also interesting. It's perhaps intended to remind an American audience of a previous use of the same phrase: when the UK, Poland and other countries joined the US invasion of Iraq. Russia has so far rejected the idea of any NATO or European peacekeeping force in Ukraine. Who's in? Sir Keir is being \"quite coy about who the willing are\", Prof Clarke said. The initiative is being led by the UK and France, so it seems a safe bet that both countries would be involved in the coalition. Both have powerful militaries and the two nations are also the only countries in Europe with nuclear weapons. \"The important thing is that Britain and France are going to lead it because they are the two most important military powers in Europe,\" Prof Clarke told Sky News. It is notable that France's President Emmanuel Macron originally raised the possibility of French troops in Ukraine last year, when he refused to rule it out. The Baltic states - Estonia, Lithuania and Latvia - are also likely to be involved, along with Finland, Prof Clarke says. All four countries are in NATO and share borders with Russia. Italy could be involved too, Prof Clarke said, though Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni has clashed with Mr Macron over the idea last week. Not in Europe but a NATO member, Canada seems another potential contributor to the coalition of the willing. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, when asked about a potential deployment of troops as part of a peacekeeping force, said yesterday: \"Canada has looked at the ways it can best help and as I've said a few days ago, everything's on the table.\"  Who's out? Prof Clarke said Poland, Spain and Germany are not expected to send troops as peacekeepers, for different reasons. Poland has one of the strongest militaries in Europe and aims to spend 4.7% of its GDP on defence this year, well above the NATO target. But it also has a long border with Ukraine and Belarus and is concerned about its own security. Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk last month said: \"We do not plan to send Polish soldiers to the territory of Ukraine.\" \"We will... give logistical and political support to the countries that will possibly want to provide such guarantees in the future, such physical guarantees.\" Spain's foreign minister Jose Manuel Albares said last month that it was \"too early at the moment to talk about deploying troops in Ukraine\", in remarks quoted by AFP. He added: \"There is no peace at the moment, and the effort has to be to achieve it as soon as possible.\" Spain's government has faced a number of crises at home and spends around 1.28% of GDP on defence, well below the NATO 2% target. As the biggest economy in Europe, Germany is a crucial part of any united response to the Ukraine war. But a new government has not yet been formed after last month's elections. Outgoing Chancellor Olaf Scholz has previously ruled out sending German troops to Ukraine as peacekeepers. While his government has provided substantial support to Ukraine since the full-scale invasion, he has been seen by some as hesitant - for example resisting calls to send the vaunted Taurus missiles to Kyiv. Friedrich Merz, who is expected to replace him as chancellor once the new government is in place, has taken a harder line, including on pledging Taurus missiles, so it remains to be seen if his attitude on deploying troops will also deviate from his predecessor. Security and Defence Editor The use of the term \"coalition of the willing\" to describe the nations that agree to support an international force to help protect any ceasefire deal in Ukraine is interesting and notable. It could perhaps be an attempt by Sir Keir Starmer to appeal to an American audience as this was the phrase the United States used for its \"coalition of the willing\" to invade Iraq more than two decades ago. That intervention ended in disaster, triggering a bloody insurgency and locking the US and its allies into a costly war, despite the successful toppling of Saddam Hussein. But reviving the words \"coalition of the willing\" will - if nothing else - remind Washington that London was its biggest and strongest backer when it turned to allies to back its 2003 invasion. What about America? The elephant in the room is the biggest contributor to NATO: the US. For example, of the 5,015 fighter and fighter ground-attack aircraft in NATO, 2,951 of them are from the US, and a further 1,108 are US-made, according to the International Institute for Strategic Studies thinktank. And America's military is not just the largest in the world, but its ability to support troops in the field in terms of logistics is very hard to replace. ðŸ‘‰ Listen to Sky News Daily on your podcast app ðŸ‘ˆ The coalition of the willing initiative seems designed to show President Donald Trump that Europe is serious about shouldering the defence burden and taking on more responsibility for the defence of Ukraine. It should be pointed out that while the US is the single biggest donor to Kyiv, Europe as a whole has pledged more, according to the Kiel Institute for the World Economy thinktank. Read more:Trump and Zelenskyy's body language analysedInside a Ukrainian titanium mine The hope seems to be that the coalition of the willing initiative would persuade the US as the world's most powerful military to pledge support as a backstop, to underwrite the peace deal.

        "Content": "The Pope has had two episodes of \"acute respiratory failure\", the Vatican has said.  The 88-year-old has been in hospital since 14 February with a severe respiratory infection that triggered other complications. The Vatican said the respiratory failures were caused by \"significant accumulation\" of mucus in his lungs and a \"bronchospasm\", akin to an asthma attack. Doctors were then required to perform two bronchoscopies - a test which sees medics use a long, thin, telescope with a light to look into the lungs - to evaluate the Pope's air passages, the statement said. \"In the afternoon, non-invasive mechanical ventilation was resumed,\" the Vatican continued. \"The Holy Father has always remained vigilant, oriented and collaborative. The prognosis remains reserved.\" Vatican sources said the situation had been calm this morning, before becoming worse this afternoon.  The respiratory issues the Pope suffered today are due to an ongoing infection rather than a new one but he is not out of danger, they added. Asked if the Pope is in good spirits, they gave no answer. When asked if the Vatican's apartment is getting ready to welcome Francis back, the source said it was too premature to discuss this. His clinical picture remains complex, they said.

This has become the longest public absence of his 12-year papacy. Cardinal Konrad Krajewski presided over the evening rosary prayer in St Peter's Square on Sunday night. \"Let us pray together with the entire church for the health of the Holy Father Francis,\" he said."

Among those hurt, five people are in a serious condition after a black vehicle hit pedestrians on Monday, according to German police and prosecutors. At a news conference, reporters were told the driver intentionally rammed his car into people and is being investigated for murder and attempted murder. They said the man shot himself in the mouth when he was arrested and is in a stable condition in hospital. Investigators are examining the possibility he may have psychological issues. The state's interior minister Thomas Strobl said a 40-year-old man from the nearby state of Rhineland-Palatinate had been detained. \"As far as the specific motivation of the crime is concerned, we have no indication of an extremist or religious background at the moment,\" he said. Police spokesperson Stefan Wilhelm said the incident unfolded on Monday at around 12.15pm local time in a pedestrianised part of Mannheim's Paradeplatz area.

        "Content": " An adventurer who was just days from completing a solo row from the US to Australia has been rescued by a warship after getting caught in a tropical cyclone. Aurimas Mockus was in the final stages of his 7,500-mile voyage across the Pacific Ocean, which he started in an enclosed boat in October. After hitting stormy seas and 50mph winds generated by Tropical Cyclone Alfred, the Lithuanian 44-year-old became stranded for three days in the Coral Sea around 460 miles east of the Queensland coast. He had been rowing from San Diego in California to the Queensland capital of Brisbane. Mr Mockus was taken aboard the Royal Australian Navy's HMAS Choules on Monday and was being medically assessed. He activated an emergency beacon on Friday after hitting the stormy conditions, the Australian Maritime Safety Authority said. Officials said a plane was sent and made radio contact with Mr Mockus on Saturday, adding he was \"fatigued\". The warship is taking Mr Mockus south beyond Brisbane to Sydney, the navy said. The cyclone was 280 miles east of Brisbane on Monday and is forecast to cross the Australian coast on Thursday or Friday. Mr Mockus was attempting to become one of the few rowers who have crossed the Pacific alone and without stopping. Briton Peter Bird arguably became the first in 1983 after setting off from San Francisco.

However, some believe British adventurer John Beeden was the first to row solo and non-stop across the Pacific Ocean when he travelled from San Francisco to the Queensland city of Cairns in 2015. Australian Michelle Lee became the first woman to make the crossing in 2023, rowing from Ensenada in Mexico to Queensland's Port Douglas."

        "Content": " Donald Trump has paused US military aid to Ukraine just days after his row with President Zelenskyy. A White House official, speaking anonymously, said: \"President [Trump] has been clear that he is focused on peace. \"We need our partners to be committed to that goal as well. We are pausing and reviewing our aid to ensure that it is contributing to a solution.\" There was no indication about the possible length of the pause, and there's been no comment so far from Ukraine. It comes after the astonishing clash between the two leaders - as well as vice president Vance - in the Oval Office on Friday. Donald Trump's berating of Mr Zelenskyy has led to a show of support from European leaders as they try to formulate their own way forward. The US president attacked the Ukrainian leader again on Monday, telling reporters he should be \"more appreciative\". \n                  Donald Trump confirms Mexico and Canada tariffs - sending financial markets reeling\n                 \n                  America will not put up with it for much longer!': Donald Trump hits out at Ukraine's President Zelenskyy once again\n                 \n                  Lord Mandelson's claim Ukraine should commit to ceasefire before Russia 'not government policy', minister says\n                 Writing on Truth Social, Mr Trump also said Mr Zelenskyy had made \"the worst statement that could have been made\" after he commented that peace was still \"very, very far away\". \"America will not put up with it for much longer!\" he posted. \"It is what I was saying, this guy doesn't want there to be peace as long as he has America's backing,\" the president added. Mr Zelenskyy then posted on X, saying Ukraine was \"working together with America and our European partners and very much hope on US support on the path to peace\". \"Peace is needed as soon as possible,\" he said. By David Blevins, US correspondent President Trump's decision to pause military aid to Ukraine marks a significant shift in US foreign policy, one previously considered unthinkable. This blow to Ukraine's defences in the face of Russian aggression will be music to the ears of President Putin. US military aid has kept Ukraine in this David and Goliath battle for three years.\n It has funded what military analysts simplify as \"the big stuff\" of battle â€“ artillery, anti-tank weapons, rockets and armoured vehicles. Trumpâ€™s decision to push pause disregards efforts by Keir Starmer and other European leaders to devise a peace plan.\n Those already questioning Europe's reliance on the US for defence will conclude they have been given the answer.  But the decision sets President Trump up for a potential confrontation with Republicans, who had approved the funding, in Congress.\n White House sources say he wants President Zelenskyy to go on TV and apologise for the jaw-dropping showdown last Friday. But the Ukrainian president feels he has no apology to make for expressing his doubt about Russia's commitment to peace. Earlier, Trump side-stepped a question about a Kremlin diplomat claiming the US administration and Moscow were now aligned on foreign policy.\n This weakening of Ukraine's defence capability moves that question front and centre as he prepares to address Congress on Tuesday. Despite the diplomatic crisis, President Trump has said a deal is still possible. An agreement giving the US access to Ukraine's rare earth metals was meant to have been signed by the two presidents on Friday. It was billed as an important step in a future peace deal - and part payback for aid already received. However, the dramatic falling out has thrown that into jeopardy. Mr Zelenskyy wants the metals deal to include guarantees on halting Russia should it break the terms of any peace agreement. European allies - who met the Ukrainian leader in London on Sunday - are working up a \"coalition of the willing\" to deploy peacekeeping troops and deter further Russian aggression in the event of a ceasefire. The prime minister said Britain is prepared to put \"boots on the ground and planes in the air\" - but it's currently unclear who else might be involved.  Read more:Long-range drones 'weakening Russia's combat ability'Zelenskyy: 'I am exchangeable for NATO membership'The coalition that could secure peace in Ukraine Keir Starmer told MPs on Monday that Britain must \"lead from the front\" on supporting Ukraine and the \"security of our continent, the security of our country\". However, the prime minister believes any European deployment of troops must have a US \"backstop\" deterrent to be taken seriously by Russia.  America has given around â‚¬64bn of military aid to Ukraine, compared with â‚¬62bn from European nations (including Britain). The overall US total is â‚¬114bn and the European one â‚¬132bn. This includes humanitarian aid and other financial assistance to keep the country running. Following the weekend summit, the UK also pledged Â£1.6bn in finance for Ukraine to buy another 5,000 air defence missiles."

        "Content": " A state of emergency has been declared in South Carolina as wildfires caused by dry and gusty conditions have forced people to evacuate some areas. More than 175 fires covered 6.6 square miles in the state on Sunday as the National Weather Service warned of an increased risk of blazes in the region. The number of fires was down to 163 by early Monday, the state's forestry commission said. South Carolina governor Henry McMaster declared a state of emergency on Sunday to support the wildfire response effort and a state-wide burning ban is in effect. People in eight neighbourhoods were forced to evacuate as several fires raged in the state's Horry County, officials said. Soldiers used two Blackhawk helicopters to drop water 600 gallons at a time on the blazes, the South Carolina National Guard said on Sunday. Meanwhile, firefighters made progress containing a fire in Carolina Forest, where people had been ordered to evacuate several neighbourhoods, according to Horry County Fire Rescue. Footage showed some people running down the street as smoke filled the sky. However, Horry County Fire Rescue announced by late Sunday that Carolina Forest evacuees could return home. The Red Cross of South Carolina said approximately 135 Carolina Forest residents had taken shelter in a county recreation centre. The fire in the area had burned 2.5 square miles as of Sunday evening, the South Carolina Forestry Commission estimated. No structures had succumbed to the blaze and no injuries had been reported as of Sunday morning, officials said. It came as fire crews were working to contain multiple wildfires burning in four forests across North Carolina. The largest covered around 0.6 square miles and burned in Uwharrie National Forest - about 50 miles east of Charlotte. The North Carolina Forest Service said on Sunday that it had been made progress on the fire, reaching about one-third containment. The small southwestern town of Tryon in Polk County, North Carolina, had urged some residents to evacuate on Saturday as a fire spread rapidly there. The evacuations remained in effect on Sunday. A decision on whether to lift the evacuation orders was expected to be made on Monday after intentional burns are set to try to stop the fire from spreading. That fire had burned about 0.8 square miles as of Sunday evening, with 0% containment, according to the Polk County Emergency Management and Fire Marshal's office. Read more US news:Crypto prices rally after Trump announcementUS speaker says Zelenskyy might need to resignNew York Dolls singer dies The North Carolina Forest Service was conducting water drops and back-burning operations on the ground and residents should expect a lot of smoke during those operations, officials said. It comes as at least six active fires were burning in Georgia on Sunday, with nearly 5.8 miles burned in a seven-day span that brought the region gusty winds and low humidity, according to a Georgia Forestry Commission fire summary. Officials have not said what caused any of the fires. The dry and gusty conditions fuelling the fires are expected to fade as a cold front pushes out the dry air mass over the southeast of the US and brings rain by Tuesday, the National Weather Service said. The convergence of warmth, dry air and gusty winds is not inconsistent with the season's La NiÃ±a weather phenomenon, which is associated with warmer, drier winters in the Carolinas, according to North Carolina State University. The blazes come after two wildfires in Los Angeles killed 29 people and scorched thousands of acres across 24 days. More than 18,000 structures were damaged or destroyed in the deadly Eaton and Palisades blazes, which swept across California in January."

He said his January executive order on digital assets would create a stockpile of currencies including Bitcoin, Ethereum, XRP, Solana and Cardano (ADA). The names had not previously been announced. The American president said in a post on Truth Social: \"A US Crypto Reserve will elevate this critical industry after years of corrupt attacks by the Biden Administration, which is why my Executive Order on Digital Assets directed the Presidential Working Group to move forward on a Crypto Strategic Reserve that includes XRP, SOL, and ADA.\" \"I will make sure the US is the Crypto Capital of the World.\" \"And, obviously, BTC and ETH, as other valuable Cryptocurrencies, will be at the heart of the Reserve,\" he said in a follow-up post. \"I also love Bitcoin and Ethereum!\" Bitcoin, the world's largest cryptocurrency by market value, rose over 11% to $94,164 after Sunday's announcement. Ethereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency, was up around 13% at $2,516. XRP surged 33% while the token tied to Solana jumped 25%. Cardano's coin soared more than 60%. Bitcoin was trading up around 20% from last week's lows. The total cryptocurrency market rose about 10%, or more than $300bn (Â£238bn), in the hours since the announcement, according to cryptocurrency data and analysis company CoinGecko. This is the first time Mr Trump has specified his support for a crypto \"reserve\" rather than a \"stockpile\". While the former assumes actively buying crypto in regular installments, a stockpile would not sell any of the crypto currently held by the US government. Mr Trump is hosting the first White House Crypto Summit on Friday, and investors will be watching closely for more clues about the direction of the reserve plans. His family have also launched their own coins, including his wife Melania.

After his re-election to the White House in November, there were more calls for a strategic Bitcoin reserve, helping to send the price of the flagship cryptocurrency to new all-time highs.

Under Mr Trump, the Securities and Exchange Commission has withdrawn investigations into several crypto companies and dropped a lawsuit against Coinbase, the largest crypto exchange in the US.

Robert E Crimo III, 24, had pleaded not guilty to the shooting - but changed his plea just moments before opening statements at his trial. Prosecutors originally charged Crimo with 21 counts of first-degree murder, three for each person killed, and 48 counts of attempted murder. They dropped 48 less serious counts of aggravated battery before jury selection last week. Judge Victoria Rossetti read the charges to Crimo and asked questions to ensure he understood before his new plea was read to the court today in Lake County, Illinois. He mostly gave one-word answers and indicated he understood the charges. The plea change means the trial - which had been expected to last a month - will not go ahead, the judge told the court. \n                  Donald Trump pauses US military aid to Ukraine\n                 \n                  Donald Trump confirms Mexico and Canada tariffs - sending financial markets reeling\n                 \n                  Ukraine war latest: Trump warns Zelenskyy but says minerals deal not dead; Russian oil pipeline 'on fire'\n                 \"He has knowingly and voluntarily waived those rights and pleaded guilty,\" Rossetti said. The proceedings were briefly interrupted as the defendant's mother had a brief outburst at her son's plea change. She was called to the bench and given a warning but allowed to stay in the courtroom. Crimo will be sentenced on 23 April and is certain to spend the rest of his life behind bars as each first-degree murder count carries a natural life prison sentence.  The change of plea shocked those in the courtroom and Ashbey Beasley, who attended the 2022 parade with her son, said it was a huge relief. Ms Beasley and her son had to run for their lives, she said, and while they were not injured, they have needed to heal. \"Every single time I see [Crimo], it's stressful,\" she told reporters. \"It's upsetting for everyone in our community,\" she told reporters after court. \"We all just wanted this to be over.\" Read more:Crimo's violent online trailDad hid son in bin as shooting unfolded In a Chicago suburb around 30 miles north of the city, Crimo perched on a roof and fired into crowds gathered for a Fourth of July parade in 2022, authorities said.

        "Content": "Former Barclays boss Jes Staley has begun a legal bid to overturn a ban from the UK's financial services industry, related to his links to the disgraced financier Jeffrey Epstein. The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) proposed the leadership ban in 2023, alongside a Â£1.8m fine, finding that Mr Staley had made misleading statements about his relationship with Epstein in correspondence with the watchdog. Mr Staley's barrister told the Upper Tribunal in a written statement that Mr Staley, who had quit his job at Barclays in 2021 to contest the FCA's findings, admits a \"close professional relationship\" with Epstein but denies they were friends. Money latest: Don't fall for this 'Apple charger' trick Their association dates back to a time when Epstein was a client of JPMorgan Chase's private bank, which Mr Staley headed before taking the role at Barclays in 2015. The FCA's ruling related to the contents of a letter sent by the then Barclays chairman in 2019, but reviewed by Mr Staley, which summarised the depth of the two men's ties in response to a request for \"assurance\" from the regulator. The watchdog determined it contained two misleading statements over their relationship, namely over how close they were and that Mr Staley's last contact with Epstein was \"well before he joined Barclays in 2015\". \n                  Sick pay boost for 1.3 million lowest-paid workers\n                 \n                  Arms firms across Europe worth billions more amid talk of Ukraine defence pact\n                 \n                  Money blog: 'Apple charger' trick exposed; Vodafone taking on Musk; state pension top-up deadline relaxed\n                 The FCA further found that they maintained contact through Mr Staley's daughter up to at least February 2017. Its barrister, Leigh-Ann Mulcahy KC, said in her written opening submission that he acted \"recklessly and without integrity\" by allowing the letter to be sent with the misleading statements. \"Mr Staley has consistently mis-stated the nature of his relationship with Mr Epstein, in particular downplaying thecloseness and extent of their connection, and the time they ceased contact,\" she added. The FCA's case includes more than 1,000 emails between the pair, some provided by JPMorgan andothers from Epstein's estate, in which Staley was said to have described their friendship as \"profound\" and referred to Epstein as \"family\". \"While the origin of the relationship was professional, it evolved into a personal relationship,\" the barrister said. Epstein killed himself in a New York jail cell in 2019 while awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges. In addition to his proposed FCA fine, Mr Staley missed out on pay and bonus awards above Â£18m after he left Barclays under a cloud. Mr Staley's barrister, Robert Smith KC, argued the letter sent by Barclays chair Nigel Higgins to the FCA was \"intended to achieve only one purpose, which was to inform the (FCA) that neither Mr Staley nor Barclays had had anyknowledge of or involvement in Mr Epstein's unlawful conduct\". He added that the letter was not meant to give a full account of their interactions. Mr Staley is expected to give evidence to the hearing in London next week. The Upper Tribunal is also expected to hear from Bank of England governor Andrew Bailey, who was in charge of the FCA between 2016 and 2020."

Read more on the Oscars:Oscars live: All the latest reaction to the awardsOscars red carpet 2025: All the best looksFull list of all the Oscar winning films and stars  Anora also won the Oscars for best original screenplay and best editing. Winning all four awards he was up for, Baker tied with Walt Disney's record for the most Oscar wins by a single person in a single night - although Disney won his awards for multiple works, rather than a single film as Baker has done. Adrien Brody won the best actor Oscar for playing Hungarian architect Lazlo Toth in architectural epic The Brutalist. It was his second Academy Award win in the category some 22 years after his first, for The Pianist back in 2003. Accepting his award in a lengthy speech, he paid tribute to his partner Georgina Chapman, who he said had \"re-invigorated\" his \"self-worth\" and \"sense of value\". Best cinematography also went to The Brutalist director Brady Corbet's three-and-a-half-hour epic, which also took home the prize for best original score. Papal thriller Conclave, starring Ralph Fiennes, took just one award, for best adapted screenplay. Kieran Culkin took the first award of the night, best supporting actor, for his role in comedy drama A Real Pain, while the best supporting actress prize was won by Emilia Perez star Zoe Saldana, her first Oscar win and nomination. One of the highest-grossing actresses ever, she cried out \"Mommy, mommy\", on stage, explaining her entire family was there with her. She became tearful at the end of her speech as she spoke of being \"a proud child of immigrant parents\". Announced by Mick Jagger, best song went to Emilia Perez's El Mal (which translates as \"Evil\"), while the prize for costume design went to Wicked's Paul Tazewell - who became the first black man to receive the award. The Wizard Of Oz prequel also won best production design. Brazilian director Walter Salles won best international feature for Portuguese-language film I'm Still Here, set in the 1970s in the midst of the Brazil's brutal military dictatorship.  A word-of-mouth hit, the film's Brazilian star Fernanda Torres has gone from a relative unknown to a much-talked-about actress in the US in the last few months. Make-up and hairstyling was awarded to body horror The Substance, a film which showcased extreme prosthetics, make-up and gore throughout. It was the film's only win of the night. The documentary categories went to The Only Girl In The Orchestra and No Other Land - made by a Palestinian-Israeli collective - for short film and feature film respectively. Accepting the prize, it's makers Basel Dra and Yuval Abraham made a political plea to the US: \"The foreign policy in this country is helping to block [the path of peace]. Why? Can't you see that we are intertwined? There is another way. It's not too late for life, for the living.\" Best sound and best visual effects went to Dune: Part Two, directed by Canadian filmmaker Denis Villeneuve. A night where independent and unusual filmmaking was rewarded, best animated feature went to Latvian computer-generated film Flow, while best animated short film was won by Iranian entry The Shadow Of The Cypress. Both international productions are dialogue-free. Live action short film went to I'm Not A Robot, a study in an AI-fueled identity crisis. During the ceremony's in memoriam section, Morgan Freeman paid tribute to two-time Oscar-winning actor Gene Hackman, who was found dead in his home along with his wife and dog earlier this week. A video montage honoured Academy members who have passed away over the last year, including British stars Dame Maggie Smith and Dame Joan Plowwright and Donald Sutherland, and US performers James Earl Jones, Kris Kristofferson and David Lynch. There was also a moving segment honouring late music producer Quincy Jones, led by Oprah Winfrey and Whoopi Goldberg and featuring rapper Queen Latifah.

        "Content": "\n          Business and economics reporter\n              @SkyNewsBiz\n Around 1.3 million people on low wages are to secure guaranteed sick pay for the first time in a bid to boost health and living standards, the government has announced. Those earning less than Â£123 a week on average will be entitled to a sick pay equivalent of 80% of their weekly salary or the new rate of statutory sick pay (SSP) - due to rise to Â£118.75 per week in April. Employers will have to pay whatever the lowest sum is under a compromise achieved following discussions with business leaders - already reeling from a looming hike to minimum wage and employer national insurance contributions announced in October's budget. Money latest: Vodafone taking on Musk The new sick pay policy is expected to take effect next year but, crucially, it will apply from the first day of sickness rather than after the third consecutive day. The government argues that the measure will keep more people off benefits and leave some up to Â£100 better off per week because they will remain in employment. Work and Pensions Secretary Liz Kendall said: \"For too long, sick workers have had to decide between staying at home and losing a day's pay, or soldiering on at their own risk just to make ends meet. \n                  Arms firms across Europe worth billions more amid talk of Ukraine defence pact\n                 \n                  Money blog: 'Apple charger' trick exposed; Vodafone taking on Musk; state pension top-up deadline relaxed\n                 \n                  Crypto prices rally after Trump names Bitcoin and others for US strategic reserve\n                 \"No one should ever have to choose between their health and earning a living, which is why we are making this landmark change. \"The new rate is good for workers and fair on businesses as part of our plan to boost rights and make work pay, while delivering our plan for change.\" Unions had argued for an even higher figure.  The British Chambers of Commerce welcomed the outcome of the talks but said its members were still set to face further additional costs arising from the policy shift - on top of the budget measures due to take effect this April. Jane Gratton, its deputy director of public policy, said: \"Employers often struggle to find shift cover at short notice, leading to disruption for customers. \"The government's impact assessment did not produce compelling evidence on the day-one rights issue, so there may yet be unforeseen consequences.\" The announcement was made as MPs debate the wider employment rights Bill amid reports the government could drop its commitment to a 'right to switch off' outside of working hours. The Sunday Times also reported at the weekend that a series of amendments was likely to be tabled by ministers as part of government efforts to keep business sweet following a brutal backlash to the budget. Business groups have argued that the Â£25bn annual hit from the employment tax measures will result in job cuts, poor pay awards and weaker investment - hitting the government's growth agenda. Rachel Suff, wellbeing adviser at the HR body CIPD, said of the additional sick pay plans: \"Phasing in elements of the Employment Rights Bill and ensuring sufficient support and guidance for employers will be vital to making sure these measures work for employers and employees.\""

Also boosting the FTSE 100 was defence and aerospace firm Rolls-Royce Holdings whose stock rose 6% at one point on Monday.

Expectations of more defence spending rose after European leaders got together in London to discuss greater funding for Ukraine in its fight against Russia and a possible EU-backed peace deal. Why?  Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer announced on Sunday a loan to Ukraine and a Â£1.6bn deal for a Belfast factory to supply missiles for the country's fight against Russia. Mr Starmer had suggested a coalition of European and other allies could defend a potential deal for Ukraine to \"guarantee the peace\" and increase military spending to do so. He made the comments at a summit of EU leaders, along with Canada and Turkey, which had been planned for more than a week but took on urgency following the disastrous meeting and diplomatic breakdown between President Donald Trump and Volodymyr Zelenskyy at the White House on Friday. The UK had already announced it would increase military spending to 2.5% of GDP - a measure of everything produced in the economy - by 2027. Chancellor Rachel Reeves had also announced an extra Â£2.26bn for the Ukrainian war effort, funded by the profits made from hundreds of billions of dollars worth of Russian sovereign assets frozen since the start of the full-scale war in February 2022."

He said his January executive order on digital assets would create a stockpile of currencies including Bitcoin, Ethereum, XRP, Solana and Cardano (ADA). The names had not previously been announced. The American president said in a post on Truth Social: \"A US Crypto Reserve will elevate this critical industry after years of corrupt attacks by the Biden Administration, which is why my Executive Order on Digital Assets directed the Presidential Working Group to move forward on a Crypto Strategic Reserve that includes XRP, SOL, and ADA.\" \"I will make sure the US is the Crypto Capital of the World.\" \"And, obviously, BTC and ETH, as other valuable Cryptocurrencies, will be at the heart of the Reserve,\" he said in a follow-up post. \"I also love Bitcoin and Ethereum!\" Bitcoin, the world's largest cryptocurrency by market value, rose over 11% to $94,164 after Sunday's announcement. Ethereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency, was up around 13% at $2,516. XRP surged 33% while the token tied to Solana jumped 25%. Cardano's coin soared more than 60%.

The total cryptocurrency market rose about 10%, or more than $300bn (Â£238bn), in the hours since the announcement, according to cryptocurrency data and analysis company CoinGecko. This is the first time Mr Trump has specified his support for a crypto \"reserve\" rather than a \"stockpile\". While the former assumes actively buying crypto in regular installments, a stockpile would not sell any of the crypto currently held by the US government. Mr Trump is hosting the first White House Crypto Summit on Friday, and investors will be watching closely for more clues about the direction of the reserve plans. His family have also launched their own coins, including his wife Melania.

After his re-election to the White House in November, there were more calls for a strategic Bitcoin reserve, helping to send the price of the flagship cryptocurrency to new all-time highs.

        "Content": "Former Barclays boss Jes Staley has begun a legal bid to overturn a ban from the UK's financial services industry, related to his links to the disgraced financier Jeffrey Epstein. The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) proposed the leadership ban in 2023, alongside a Â£1.8m fine, finding that Mr Staley had made misleading statements about his relationship with Epstein in correspondence with the watchdog. Mr Staley's barrister told the Upper Tribunal in a written statement that Mr Staley, who had quit his job at Barclays in 2021 to contest the FCA's findings, admits a \"close professional relationship\" with Epstein but denies they were friends. Money latest: Don't fall for this 'Apple charger' trick Their association dates back to a time when Epstein was a client of JPMorgan Chase's private bank, which Mr Staley headed before taking the role at Barclays in 2015. The FCA's ruling related to the contents of a letter sent by the then Barclays chairman in 2019, but reviewed by Mr Staley, which summarised the depth of the two men's ties in response to a request for \"assurance\" from the regulator. The watchdog determined it contained two misleading statements over their relationship, namely over how close they were and that Mr Staley's last contact with Epstein was \"well before he joined Barclays in 2015\". \n                  Sick pay boost for 1.3 million lowest-paid workers\n                 \n                  Arms firms across Europe worth billions more amid talk of Ukraine defence pact\n                 \n                  Money blog: 'Apple charger' trick exposed; Vodafone taking on Musk; state pension top-up deadline relaxed\n                 The FCA further found that they maintained contact through Mr Staley's daughter up to at least February 2017. Its barrister, Leigh-Ann Mulcahy KC, said in her written opening submission that he acted \"recklessly and without integrity\" by allowing the letter to be sent with the misleading statements. \"Mr Staley has consistently mis-stated the nature of his relationship with Mr Epstein, in particular downplaying thecloseness and extent of their connection, and the time they ceased contact,\" she added. The FCA's case includes more than 1,000 emails between the pair, some provided by JPMorgan andothers from Epstein's estate, in which Staley was said to have described their friendship as \"profound\" and referred to Epstein as \"family\". \"While the origin of the relationship was professional, it evolved into a personal relationship,\" the barrister said. Epstein killed himself in a New York jail cell in 2019 while awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges. In addition to his proposed FCA fine, Mr Staley missed out on pay and bonus awards above Â£18m after he left Barclays under a cloud. Mr Staley's barrister, Robert Smith KC, argued the letter sent by Barclays chair Nigel Higgins to the FCA was \"intended to achieve only one purpose, which was to inform the (FCA) that neither Mr Staley nor Barclays had had anyknowledge of or involvement in Mr Epstein's unlawful conduct\". He added that the letter was not meant to give a full account of their interactions. Mr Staley is expected to give evidence to the hearing in London next week. The Upper Tribunal is also expected to hear from Bank of England governor Andrew Bailey, who was in charge of the FCA between 2016 and 2020."

Sky News has learnt that CVC is among the remaining bidders for the Miami Open and Madrid Open, both of which feature the world's leading male and female tennis players. Sources close to the process, which is being handled by The Raine Group, said a further round of bids - thought to be worth in the region of $1bn - were due to be submitted later this month. The assets are currently owned by Endeavor Group Holdings, the global sports and entertainment company headed by the former Hollywood talent agent Ari Emanuel. Money blog: Crypto soars after Trump announcement CVC is said to be bidding against Mr Emanuel himself, with the Endeavor chief understood to have engaged bankers at Goldman Sachs to advise him on his offer.

A number of wealthy individuals are said to have expressed interest in buying individual tournaments on a standalone basis, although Endeavor is expected to pursue a single deal for all of the assets. If CVC was successful with its bid, it would represent the prolific sports investor's first foray into owning tournaments in which the world's leading male players - including Carlos Alcaraz and Alexander Zverev - will feature. Jannik Sinner, the world number one, will miss both IMG-owned tournaments this year after being handed a three-month ban by the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) in January, while the former number one Novak Djokovic is likely to omit both from his truncated 2025 schedule. The Miami Open is due to begin on 16 March, while its Madrid counterpart gets underway on 21 April. In addition to the two premier events, both of which carry 1,000 world ranking points for the winners, the IMG portfolio includes the Barcelona Open and the annual pre-Wimbledon tournament at London's Hurlingham Club. The ATP Masters 1000 Series and WTA 1000 events are one rung on the tennis hierarchy beneath the four annual Grand Slam events, which are held in Melbourne, Paris, at Wimbledon and in New York. CVC already has a significant presence in professional tennis, having formed a commercial joint venture with the Women's Tennis Association (WTA) in 2023. In the first full year of the partnership - in which CVC invested $150m - WTA Ventures saw revenue growth of 24%, in the wake of a new strategy which included the first WTA Finals in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. WTA Ventures said the increase put it on track to achieve a long-term objective of tripling commercial revenue during the six years between 2023 and 2029. The commercial entity is run by Marina Storti, a former executive at Sky, Sky News' immediate parent company. One tennis insider said the sport was likely to welcome additional investment in tennis. The 2025 women's rankings are headed by Aryna Sabalenka, with Poland's Iga Swiatek and the American Coco Gauff directly behind her.

Since then, New York-listed TKO Group Holdings has struck a deal to buy assets from Endeavor including IMG.

In a letter to the prime minister seen by Sky News, the former Labour leader argued there was public concern British officials had been implicated \"in the gravest breaches of international law\" because of decisions made by the government. Mr Corbyn, now the independent MP for Islington North, said he had repeatedly sought answers on the continued sale of components for F-35 jets to Israel, the role of British military bases and the legal definition of genocide - but had been met with \"evasion, obstruction and silence\". As a result, the government was \"leaving the public in the dark over the ways in which the responsibilities of government have been discharged\", Mr Corbyn argued. Politics latest: Zelenskyy was 'rude' to Trump, says Farage 'History is repeating itself' Drawing parallels with the Chilcot inquiry into the Iraq War - which found the UK's decision to invade was based on \"flawed intelligence and assessments\" - Mr Corbyn said \"history is repeating itself\". The Chilcot report, which was published in 2016 following a series of delays, criticised former Labour prime minister Sir Tony Blair for not consulting his cabinet before giving George W Bush assurances the UK would be with him \"whatever\", eight months before the invasion began. It also said the circumstances leading up to the then attorney general's controversial advice that the war was legal - without a second UN resolution - were \"far from satisfactory\". In his letter, Mr Corbyn said \"many people believe the government has taken decisions that have implicated officials in the gravest breaches of international law\". \"These charges will not go away until there is a comprehensive, public, independent inquiry with the legal power to establish the truth,\" he added. The Islington MP, who was suspended from the parliamentary Labour Party in 2020 in a row over antisemitism and later blocked from standing as one of its general election candidates, said in the interests of \"transparency and accountability\" he would be \"working with colleagues in pursuing all avenues to establish an independent inquiry\". \"Today, the death toll in Gaza has exceeded 61,000,\" he said, referring to figures that include people who are missing and presumed dead. According to the Hamas-run health ministry, Israel's assault on Gaza has killed more than 48,000 Palestinians. It does not distinguish between civilians and combatants in this count. Mr Corbyn continued: \"At least 110,000 - or one in twenty - people have been injured. It is estimated that 92% of housing units have been destroyed or damaged. \"Two Israeli officials are now wanted by the International Criminal Court (ICC) for war crimes and crimes against humanity.\" These officials are Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and former defence secretary Yoav Gallant. Mr Netanyahu's office rejected the ICC warrants against him and Mr Gallant as \"antisemitic\" and said Israel \"rejects with disgust the absurd and false actions\". Referring to the October 7 attack that triggered Israel's invasion of Gaza, Mr Netanyahu said: \"With what audacity do you compare Hamas that murdered, burned, butchered, decapitated, raped and kidnapped our brothers and sisters and the IDF soldiers fighting a just war?\" While in opposition, Sir Keir struggled to contain divisions within Labour when Israel began its incursion into Gaza following the Hamas terrorist attack that killed 1,200 Israelis and saw about 250 taken hostage. The Labour leader drew criticism for an interview he gave to LBC in which he appeared to suggest that Israel had a right to limit essential supplies, including water and electricity, to Gaza. He later said he was only referring to the right Israel had to defend itself. Arms sales to Israel Last April, under Conservative prime minister Rishi Sunak, the government was warned it was breaching international law by continuing to arm Israel and faced calls to suspend arms exports to the country after three British aid workers were killed in an airstrike. Months later, the newly elected Labour government announced it would suspend some arms sales to Israel, following a review of export licences which found there was a \"clear risk\" they might be used to commit \"a serious violation of international humanitarian law\". While the UK does not directly supply Israel with weapons, it does grant export licences for British companies to sell arms to the country.  The suspension covered components that go into military aircraft that have been used in Gaza, including helicopters and drones, as well as items which facilitate ground targeting. But it did not include parts for multinational F-35 fighter jets - something that has concerned opposition MPs and human rights charities. In response, Mr Netanyahu said the decision was \"shameful\" and \"will not change Israel's determination to defeat Hamas, a genocidal terrorist organization that savagely murdered 1200 people on October 7, including 14 British citizens\".  Read more:Which countries could send troops to Ukraine?Israel stops all goods and supplies into Gaza Defining genocide Sir Keir, a former public prosecutor and human rights barrister, has also faced pressure to share his legal definition of genocide following questioning from an independent MP in the Commons. The prime minister told the Commons he was \"well aware of the definition of genocide, and that is why I have never described this as, and referred to it as, genocide\". Middle East and North Africa minister Hamish Falconer later told Mr Corbyn in a letter that it was the government's \"long-standing policy\" that \"any determination that genocide has occurred is a matter for a competent national or international court, not for governments or non-judicial bodies\". \"This approach ensures that any determination is above politics, lobbying and individual or national interest,\" he said. A Government spokesperson said: \"Our priority since day one has been a sustainable ceasefire, and a lasting peace that will ensure the long-term peace and security of both Palestinians and Israelis. \"We must build confidence on all sides that helps sustain the ceasefire and move it from phase one through to phase three, and into a lasting peace and an end to the suffering on all sides.\""

        "Content": "\n          Political reporter\n              @fayebrownSky\n  There are more tough choices to come on Ukraine and Britain must \"lead from the front\", Sir Keir Starmer has said. The prime minister gave a statement in parliament after he unveiled proposals for a \"coalition of the willing\" to enforce any peace deal in the war-torn country, and announced a plan for Kyiv to use Â£1.6bn of UK export finance to buy 5,000 more air defence missiles. Politics latest: Farage says Zelenskyy 'rude' to Trump He said the \"tough choices that we made last week are not done\" and a \"lasting peace\" in Ukraine \"has to be our goal\". \"Britain will lead from the front for the security of our continent, the security of our country, and the security of the British people,\" he said. It follows a hectic week of diplomacy for Sir Keir, during which he held talks with Donald Trump in the White House on Thursday, hosted Ukraine's president in Downing Street on Saturday and then a wider summit of world leaders on Sunday. Sandwiched in between his Washington DC trip and busy weekend back home was Volodymyr Zelenskyy's extraordinary row with the US president in the Oval Office, which cast more doubt on America's support for Kyiv. \n                  UK to defend Ukraine peace deal with 'coalition of willing', Starmer says\n                 \n                  'We can still trust the Americans', minister says despite breakdown between Trump and Zelenskyy\n                 \n                  Will ministerial resignation dent Starmer's post-Trump high?\n                 Sir Keir said the showdown is something \"nobody wants to see\" but he would not pick a side. He called America an \"indispensable\" ally, adding: \"We will never choose between either side of the Atlantic \"In fact, if anything, the past week has shown that that idea is totally unserious because while some people may enjoy the simplicity of taking a side, this week has shown with total clarity that the US is vital in securing the peace we all want to see in Ukraine.\" In front of the world's cameras on Friday, Mr Trump accused the Ukrainian president of \"disrespecting\" the United States and \"gambling with World War Three\" after he expressed scepticism that Vladimir Putin could be trusted to honour ceasefire agreements. It has intensified fears among some Western leaders that the US cannot be relied upon to continue supporting Ukraine, or provide a security guarantee to deter the Russian leader if a peace deal is struck. After the PM's statement, Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey said the UK needs to \"reduce our dependency on the United States\" as he fears President Trump is \"not a reliable ally with respect to Russia\". However, many other opposition politicians have praised Sir Keir's diplomacy this week, with Tory leader Kemi Badenoch backing the prime minister for \"working with allies in Europe and with the United States to bring peace to Ukraine and not a surrender to Russia\". Read More:The 'coalition of the willing' that could secure peace in Ukraine Sir Keir has been positioning himself as a peace broker between the US and Europe following Mr Trump's ascension to the White House and his clear indication he no longer wants to bankroll NATO's defence. He has suggested a coalition of European allies could step up and defend a potential deal for Ukraine to \"guarantee the peace\" and indicated some EU nations could follow in the UK's footsteps and increase defence spending. However, he argues that while a security guarantee should be led by Europe, it needs US backing. Mr Trump has not committed to such a guarantee and previously suggested a minerals deal between the US and Ukraine could act as one.  In response to a question from Reform UK leader Nigel Farage, Sir Keir told the Commons this would \"not be enough on its own\". In any case, the deal has been put on hold following Mr Trump's row with the Ukrainian president. Shortly after the PM finished speaking, Mr Trump hit out at Mr Zelenskyy once again, saying the US would \"not put up with him\" for much longer after he said the end of the war with Russia is \"very far away\"."

        "Content": "\n          Foreign news reporter\n              @MikeRDrummond\n  A \"coalition of the willing\" could provide boots on the ground in Ukraine in the event of a ceasefire.Â  The phrase was a central theme of Sir Keir Starmer's speech after European leaders gathered in London for crucial talks about Ukraine's future. Led by the UK and France, the initiative could see troops from a number of European and NATO countries deployed to Ukraine as peacekeepers in order to deter Vladimir Putin from rearming and attacking again in the future. Follow latest: Russia not ready to negotiate, Zelenskyy says Sir Keir said Europe \"must do the heavy lifting\" on defence and indicated several countries had expressed interest in being part of the coalition. So who's in, who's out - and what's behind these latest buzzwords? What is a coalition of the willing? The prime minister has said the UK, France and Ukraine will work together on a peace deal that could be presented to the US. The countries committed to working together on this deal would form a \"coalition of the willing\". Countries in the coalition could end up sending soldiers to act as peacekeepers in Ukraine in the event of a ceasefire. Military analyst Michael Clarke said: \"It has to be a coalition of the willing because you have at least two NATO members - Slovakia and Hungary - who are vetoing anything that Putin would not like... it's the same with the EU.\" This approach would allow NATO members to act in a group but not under the NATO umbrella, avoiding vetoes from member states who don't approve or don't wish to be involved. Sir Keir's choice of the term \"coalition of the willing\" is also interesting. It's perhaps intended to remind an American audience of a previous use of the same phrase: when the UK, Poland and other countries joined the US invasion of Iraq. Russia has so far rejected the idea of any NATO or European peacekeeping force in Ukraine. Who's in? Sir Keir is being \"quite coy about who the willing are\", Prof Clarke said. The initiative is being led by the UK and France, so it seems a safe bet that both countries would be involved in the coalition. Both have powerful militaries and the two nations are also the only countries in Europe with nuclear weapons. \"The important thing is that Britain and France are going to lead it because they are the two most important military powers in Europe,\" Prof Clarke told Sky News. It is notable that France's President Emmanuel Macron originally raised the possibility of French troops in Ukraine last year, when he refused to rule it out. The Baltic states - Estonia, Lithuania and Latvia - are also likely to be involved, along with Finland, Prof Clarke says. All four countries are in NATO and share borders with Russia. Italy could be involved too, Prof Clarke said, though Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni has clashed with Mr Macron over the idea last week. Not in Europe but a NATO member, Canada seems another potential contributor to the coalition of the willing. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, when asked about a potential deployment of troops as part of a peacekeeping force, said yesterday: \"Canada has looked at the ways it can best help and as I've said a few days ago, everything's on the table.\"  Who's out? Prof Clarke said Poland, Spain and Germany are not expected to send troops as peacekeepers, for different reasons. Poland has one of the strongest militaries in Europe and aims to spend 4.7% of its GDP on defence this year, well above the NATO target. But it also has a long border with Ukraine and Belarus and is concerned about its own security. Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk last month said: \"We do not plan to send Polish soldiers to the territory of Ukraine.\" \"We will... give logistical and political support to the countries that will possibly want to provide such guarantees in the future, such physical guarantees.\" Spain's foreign minister Jose Manuel Albares said last month that it was \"too early at the moment to talk about deploying troops in Ukraine\", in remarks quoted by AFP. He added: \"There is no peace at the moment, and the effort has to be to achieve it as soon as possible.\" Spain's government has faced a number of crises at home and spends around 1.28% of GDP on defence, well below the NATO 2% target. As the biggest economy in Europe, Germany is a crucial part of any united response to the Ukraine war. But a new government has not yet been formed after last month's elections. Outgoing Chancellor Olaf Scholz has previously ruled out sending German troops to Ukraine as peacekeepers. While his government has provided substantial support to Ukraine since the full-scale invasion, he has been seen by some as hesitant - for example resisting calls to send the vaunted Taurus missiles to Kyiv. Friedrich Merz, who is expected to replace him as chancellor once the new government is in place, has taken a harder line, including on pledging Taurus missiles, so it remains to be seen if his attitude on deploying troops will also deviate from his predecessor. Security and Defence Editor The use of the term \"coalition of the willing\" to describe the nations that agree to support an international force to help protect any ceasefire deal in Ukraine is interesting and notable. It could perhaps be an attempt by Sir Keir Starmer to appeal to an American audience as this was the phrase the United States used for its \"coalition of the willing\" to invade Iraq more than two decades ago. That intervention ended in disaster, triggering a bloody insurgency and locking the US and its allies into a costly war, despite the successful toppling of Saddam Hussein. But reviving the words \"coalition of the willing\" will - if nothing else - remind Washington that London was its biggest and strongest backer when it turned to allies to back its 2003 invasion. What about America? The elephant in the room is the biggest contributor to NATO: the US. For example, of the 5,015 fighter and fighter ground-attack aircraft in NATO, 2,951 of them are from the US, and a further 1,108 are US-made, according to the International Institute for Strategic Studies thinktank. And America's military is not just the largest in the world, but its ability to support troops in the field in terms of logistics is very hard to replace. ðŸ‘‰ Listen to Sky News Daily on your podcast app ðŸ‘ˆ The coalition of the willing initiative seems designed to show President Donald Trump that Europe is serious about shouldering the defence burden and taking on more responsibility for the defence of Ukraine. It should be pointed out that while the US is the single biggest donor to Kyiv, Europe as a whole has pledged more, according to the Kiel Institute for the World Economy thinktank. Read more:Trump and Zelenskyy's body language analysedInside a Ukrainian titanium mine The hope seems to be that the coalition of the willing initiative would persuade the US as the world's most powerful military to pledge support as a backstop, to underwrite the peace deal. It's unclear so far what Washington's response will be, particularly after the fiery recent meeting between Mr Trump, vice president JD Vance and Mr Zelenskyy."

Sebastien Lai delivered a letter to 10 Downing Street on Monday morning, asking for a meeting with Sir Keir to get his father, who has only ever had a British passport, released immediately. He said his father's case is a \"litmus test\" for the government to see if it will stand up to China for a British citizen who is in jail \"for peaceful campaigning and journalism\". \"It would take less than three hours for them to put him on a plane and send him back home to the UK,\" he said. \"So if they're not even willing to do something like this in such a clear-cut case, where he might very well die in jail, then what else can we expect from them? \"I mean, how can we expect an even or fair relationship with a country that's not even willing to release one of our citizens from very blatant persecution?\" He added that a meeting with Sir Keir would show the Hong Kong government Jimmy Lai's case is being treated \"with the utmost priority, to show they can't keep mistreating my father the way they've been doing\".  Sebastien Lai said the Hong Kong government has been keeping his father, who has diabetes, in such awful conditions \"because they believe they could get away with it\". Jimmy Lai's case is a major sticking point in the government's relations with China, with Sir Keir saying securing his release is a \"priority\" - while trying to revive trade relations with Beijing. The billionaire, who owned the pro-democracy paper Apple Daily and was a familiar face during the 2019 protests, has given his testimony for 48 days in Hong Kong, with 22 of those facing cross-examination by government lawyers.

        "Content": "\n          Business and economics reporter\n              @SkyNewsBiz\n Around 1.3 million people on low wages are to secure guaranteed sick pay for the first time in a bid to boost health and living standards, the government has announced. Those earning less than Â£123 a week on average will be entitled to a sick pay equivalent of 80% of their weekly salary or the new rate of statutory sick pay (SSP) - due to rise to Â£118.75 per week in April. Employers will have to pay whatever the lowest sum is under a compromise achieved following discussions with business leaders - already reeling from a looming hike to minimum wage and employer national insurance contributions announced in October's budget. Money latest: Vodafone taking on Musk The new sick pay policy is expected to take effect next year but, crucially, it will apply from the first day of sickness rather than after the third consecutive day. The government argues that the measure will keep more people off benefits and leave some up to Â£100 better off per week because they will remain in employment. Work and Pensions Secretary Liz Kendall said: \"For too long, sick workers have had to decide between staying at home and losing a day's pay, or soldiering on at their own risk just to make ends meet. \n                  Arms firms across Europe worth billions more amid talk of Ukraine defence pact\n                 \n                  Money blog: 'Apple charger' trick exposed; Vodafone taking on Musk; state pension top-up deadline relaxed\n                 \n                  Crypto prices rally after Trump names Bitcoin and others for US strategic reserve\n                 \"No one should ever have to choose between their health and earning a living, which is why we are making this landmark change. \"The new rate is good for workers and fair on businesses as part of our plan to boost rights and make work pay, while delivering our plan for change.\" Unions had argued for an even higher figure.  The British Chambers of Commerce welcomed the outcome of the talks but said its members were still set to face further additional costs arising from the policy shift - on top of the budget measures due to take effect this April. Jane Gratton, its deputy director of public policy, said: \"Employers often struggle to find shift cover at short notice, leading to disruption for customers. \"The government's impact assessment did not produce compelling evidence on the day-one rights issue, so there may yet be unforeseen consequences.\" The announcement was made as MPs debate the wider employment rights Bill amid reports the government could drop its commitment to a 'right to switch off' outside of working hours. The Sunday Times also reported at the weekend that a series of amendments was likely to be tabled by ministers as part of government efforts to keep business sweet following a brutal backlash to the budget. Business groups have argued that the Â£25bn annual hit from the employment tax measures will result in job cuts, poor pay awards and weaker investment - hitting the government's growth agenda. Rachel Suff, wellbeing adviser at the HR body CIPD, said of the additional sick pay plans: \"Phasing in elements of the Employment Rights Bill and ensuring sufficient support and guidance for employers will be vital to making sure these measures work for employers and employees.\""

        "Content": "\n          Science and Technology reporter\n       People suffering from multiple food allergies may have more treatment options after scientists discovered an injectable medicine was an effective treatment. The team of US researchers found that omalizumab performed better than oral immunotherapy at preventing reactions in patients with severe food allergies. Around 6% of UK adults suffer from food allergies according to the Food Standards Agency, with peanuts and tree nuts like hazelnuts, walnuts and almonds most likely to cause an allergic reaction. Last year, a number of NHS hospitals joined a 'miracle' Â£2.5m trial that saw children able to enjoy foods that would previously have triggered anaphylaxis, after undergoing oral immunotherapy. However, in the new study led by Johns Hopkins Children's Center, 36% of participants who received the new injectable drug were able to eat around eight peanuts and two other food allergens by the end of the trial, compared to just 19% of the group who underwent oral immunotherapy. Oral immunotherapy involves eating gradually increasing doses of a food to reduce the allergic response to it. Omalizumab, on the other hand, binds to an antibody called immunoglobulin E in the blood and prevents it from arming the immune cells responsible for allergic reactions. \n                  The UK places with the most and fewest fast food outlets\n                 \n                  King shows no sign of slowing down at Italian-themed food celebration\n                 \n                  Coca-Cola, Sprite and Appletiser cans recalled in UK after chemical found in testing\n                 This makes the cells less sensitive to stimulation by any allergen.

The first group then underwent oral immunotherapy and was given placebo injections of omalizumab, while the second group was given omalizumab and underwent placebo oral immunotherapy. Although at the end of the study, the same proportion of remaining people in each group could tolerate at least two grams of three foods they were allergic to, a much larger number of people dropped out of the first group before the trial could finish. More than half of the people who left that group went because they'd had allergic reactions or other intolerable symptoms of immunotherapy, according to the researchers, while no one left the second group because of allergic reactions or other symptoms. \"This is the first time we've been able to directly compare these two treatments for multiple food allergies, and our study shows omalizumab was superior to oral immunotherapy,\" said Robert Wood, who was principal investigator of the study. The research found omalizumab was more effective than oral immunotherapy because of the high rate of allergic reactions among the patients who underwent immunotherapy. In the UK, omalizumab is currently used to treat hives, an itchy red rash, and severe asthma. Sky News contacted the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency to ask if it is being considered for allergy treatment in the UK but they were unable to confirm as the information is \"commercially sensitive\"."

        "Content": "\n          Arts and entertainment reporter\n              @BethanyMinelle\n  Anora has dominated the Academy Awards, winning five gongs including best picture. The film's star, Mikey Madison, who plays a sex worker who marries the son of a Russian oligarch, took home the best actress award - a win that was not a total upset, but many had expected Demi Moore to scoop the prize for her performance in The Substance. Anora filmmaker Sean Baker was named best director, and used his acceptance speech to make a plea for audiences to support cinemas, which he said were \"a vital part of our culture\" and at risk of being lost. Both also thanked sex workers who consulted on the film, saying they could never have made it without them.

Winning all four awards he was up for, Baker tied with Walt Disney's record for the most Oscar wins by a single person in a single night - although Disney won his awards for multiple works, rather than a single film as Baker has done. Adrien Brody won the best actor Oscar for playing Hungarian architect Lazlo Toth in architectural epic The Brutalist. It was his second Academy Award win in the category some 22 years after his first, for The Pianist back in 2003. Accepting his award in a lengthy speech, he paid tribute to his partner Georgina Chapman, who he said had \"re-invigorated\" his \"self-worth\" and \"sense of value\". Best cinematography also went to The Brutalist director Brady Corbet's three-and-a-half-hour epic, which also took home the prize for best original score. Papal thriller Conclave, starring Ralph Fiennes, took just one award, for best adapted screenplay. Kieran Culkin took the first award of the night, best supporting actor, for his role in comedy drama A Real Pain, while the best supporting actress prize was won by Emilia Perez star Zoe Saldana, her first Oscar win and nomination. One of the highest-grossing actresses ever, she cried out \"Mommy, mommy\", on stage, explaining her entire family was there with her. She became tearful at the end of her speech as she spoke of being \"a proud child of immigrant parents\". Announced by Mick Jagger, best song went to Emilia Perez's El Mal (which translates as \"Evil\"), while the prize for costume design went to Wicked's Paul Tazewell - who became the first black man to receive the award. The Wizard Of Oz prequel also won best production design. Brazilian director Walter Salles won best international feature for Portuguese-language film I'm Still Here, set in the 1970s in the midst of the Brazil's brutal military dictatorship.  A word-of-mouth hit, the film's Brazilian star Fernanda Torres has gone from a relative unknown to a much-talked-about actress in the US in the last few months. Make-up and hairstyling was awarded to body horror The Substance, a film which showcased extreme prosthetics, make-up and gore throughout. It was the film's only win of the night. The documentary categories went to The Only Girl In The Orchestra and No Other Land - made by a Palestinian-Israeli collective - for short film and feature film respectively. Accepting the prize, it's makers Basel Dra and Yuval Abraham made a political plea to the US: \"The foreign policy in this country is helping to block [the path of peace]. Why? Can't you see that we are intertwined? There is another way. It's not too late for life, for the living.\" Best sound and best visual effects went to Dune: Part Two, directed by Canadian filmmaker Denis Villeneuve. A night where independent and unusual filmmaking was rewarded, best animated feature went to Latvian computer-generated film Flow, while best animated short film was won by Iranian entry The Shadow Of The Cypress. Both international productions are dialogue-free. Live action short film went to I'm Not A Robot, a study in an AI-fueled identity crisis. During the ceremony's in memoriam section, Morgan Freeman paid tribute to two-time Oscar-winning actor Gene Hackman, who was found dead in his home along with his wife and dog earlier this week. A video montage honoured Academy members who have passed away over the last year, including British stars Dame Maggie Smith and Dame Joan Plowwright and Donald Sutherland, and US performers James Earl Jones, Kris Kristofferson and David Lynch. There was also a moving segment honouring late music producer Quincy Jones, led by Oprah Winfrey and Whoopi Goldberg and featuring rapper Queen Latifah. Sky News is livestreaming the Vanity Fair and Sir Elton John after-party red carpets following the ceremony. Catching the Oscar-winners as they party the night away, join us there from 6am."

The bodies of Hackman, 95, his wife Betsy Arakawa, 63, and their pet dog were discovered by a maintenance worker at their house in New Mexico on Wednesday. Freeman, 87, starred alongside the late actor in the films Under Suspicion and Unforgiven, which won Hackman his second Oscar. Speaking on stage at the 97th Academy Awards ceremony in Los Angeles, Freeman said: \"This week a community lost a giant and I lost a dear friend, Gene Hackman.\" He described working with him as a \"pleasure\" and added: \"Like everyone who's ever shared a scene with him, I learned he was a generous performer and a man whose gifts elevated everyone's work.\" Read moreWhat we know about Gene Hackman's deathPolice release 911 call after bodies were discoveredGene Hackman obituary  Freeman continued: \"He received two Oscars - but more importantly he won the hearts of film lovers all over the world.  \"Gene always said 'I don't think about legacy, I just hope people remember me as someone who tried to do good work'. \"So I think I speak for us all when I say Gene, you'll be remembered for that and so much more. Rest in peace, my friend.\" The tribute was followed by others for stars who also died in the last year, including Dame Maggie Smith, Kris Kristofferson, Donald Sutherland, Joan Plowright, David Lynch, and James Earl Jones. Later, Oprah Winfrey and Whoopi Goldberg led tributes to music producer Quincy Jones after his death in 2024.  Post-mortem examinations and toxicology reports are still ongoing into Hackman's death, but preliminary findings suggest he and his wife suffered \"no external trauma\" and could have been dead for days - if not weeks. Hackman's most memorable performances include New York City detective Jimmy \"Popeye\" Doyle in The French Connection and surveillance expert Harry Caul in Francis Ford Coppola's The Conversation. As well as Oscars, he won BAFTAs and Golden Globes, before stepping away from acting in 2004 to write novels, a career he said better suited his solitary nature."

        "Content": "Renowned Scottish painter Jack Vettriano has died at the age of 73, his publicist has said. The artist was found dead at his apartment in Nice, in the south of France, on Saturday. It is understood there are no suspicious circumstances around his death. Vettriano was born Jack Hoggan on 17 November 1951 in Methil, Fife. He left school at the age of 15 to become a mining engineer but took up painting after a girlfriend gifted him a box of watercolours for his 21st birthday. The self-taught artist learned his craft by copying old masters, impressionists, surrealists and a plethora of Scottish artists. He drew inspiration from works at Kirkcaldy Galleries, studying paintings from artists such as Samuel Peploe and William McTaggart so intently that he feared arousing the suspicions of gallery staff. His breakthrough came in 1998 when he submitted two paintings to the Royal Scottish Academy's annual show and both sold on the first day, inspiring him to become a full-time artist. Vettriano's works garnered international acclaim, leading to exhibitions in cities such as Edinburgh, London, Hong Kong, Johannesburg and New York. His 1992 painting The Singing Butler is among his most famed work, becoming a best-selling image in Britain. It shows an elegant couple dancing on a storm-swept beach accompanied by their butler and maid. In 2004, the painting sold at auction for Â£744,800 - a record at the time for any Scottish painting and for any painting ever sold in Scotland. Read more from Sky News:Oscars 2025: The full list of winning films and starsThe Oscars moments everyone's talking about Among those to have acquired Vettriano paintings are Hollywood legend Jack Nicholson, former Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson, songwriter Sir Tim Rice, and late Harry Potter actor Robbie Coltrane. His publicist said in a statement: \"Jack Vettriano's passing marks the end of an era for contemporary Scottish art. \"His evocative and timeless works will continue to captivate and inspire future generations.\" Scotland's First Minister John Swinney was among those to pay tribute to Vettriano. He said: \"I am very sorry to hear that one of Scotland's best-known artists, Jack Vettriano, has died, and I want to express my deepest condolences to his family. \"From humble beginnings as a self-taught artist from Methil, Jack made a unique and evocative contribution to artistic life in Scotland, rising to become a household name thanks to iconic paintings like The Singing Butler, which has graced the walls of homes and galleries around the world. \"Born and raised in Fife, much of his early exposure to art came from the Kirkcaldy Galleries, so it was fitting that some of his earliest works were exhibited there in recent years. \"Jack was also a philanthropist for a number of important causes and I know his loss will be sorely felt by many across Scotland and the world.\" In a post on social media, Scottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar said: \"Very sad news. Jack Vettriano was an iconic Scottish artist. My thoughts are with his family and friends.\""
