        "Content": "Sir Keir Starmer has offered his \"unwavering support\" to Ukraine – saying \"we're at a turning point\" following a fiery Oval Office exchange between Volodymyr Zelenskyy and Donald Trump.  The prime minister welcomed Mr Zelenskyy to Downing Street on Saturday, where they signed a new loan deal for Ukraine following his disastrous meeting with the US president on Friday. On Sunday, the pair will be joined by dozens of world leaders for a summit on Ukraine and security. Ukraine latest: Zelenskyy to meet King Charles Sir Keir will start the day by speaking to Italian PM Giorgia Meloni, before they are joined by French President Emmanuel Macron and leaders from countries including Germany, Denmark, Norway, Poland, Canada, Finland and Romania. Turkey's foreign minister, the EU's Ursula von der Leyen and NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte will also attend. In a statement issued ahead of the meeting, Sir Keir said he \"will reaffirm my unwavering support for Ukraine and double down on my commitment to provide capacity, training and aid\" - in order to put the country \"in the strongest possible position\". \n                  Starmer's position as Trump's new best friend will be tested much more quickly than anyone predicted\n                 \n                  Zelenskyy says he is 'truly thankful' to US after Trump row - as he arrives in UK for summit\n                 \n                  NHS 'not up for grabs' in US-UK trade deal, says Wes Streeting\n                 He continued: \"In partnership with our allies, we must intensify our preparations for the European element of security guarantees alongside continued discussions with the United States. \"We have an opportunity to come together to ensure a just and lasting peace in Ukraine that secures their sovereignty and security. \"Now is the time for us to unite in order to guarantee the best outcome for Ukraine, protect European security, and secure our collective future.\" Zelenskyy's visit to Downing Street Sir Keir's statement came after he welcomed Mr Zelenskyy to Downing Street with a hug. The pair spoke briefly, before Mr Zelenskyy waved at reporters and gave a thumbs up. They then shook hands as they posed for pictures outside the door of No 10.  As they sat down inside, Sir Keir told Mr Zelenskyy: \"You have full backing across the United Kingdom and we stand with you, with Ukraine, for as long as it may take. \"I hope you heard some of that cheering in the street,\" he continued, saying the cheers signified \"our absolute determination to stand with you - unwavering determination - and to achieve what we both want to achieve, which is a lasting peace.\" Sir Keir added: \"A lasting peace for Ukraine based on sovereignty and security for Ukraine - so important for Ukraine, so important for Europe and so important for the United Kingdom.\" \"So I'm much looking forward to our discussions here this afternoon - thank you very much for making the time to come,\" he said. Mr Zelenskyy replied that he was \"happy to be here\". \"I want to thank you, the people of the United Kingdom and the King,\" he said, noting he will be meeting the monarch tomorrow. \"We count on your support,\" he continued. \"We're really happy we have such partners and such friends.\" A new loan deal for Ukraine Sir Keir and Mr Zelenskyy both posted on X following their meeting, with the British prime minister saying it was an \"honour\" to welcome the Ukrainian leader to No 10. He signed off his post with \"Slava Ukraini\", which means 'Glory to Ukraine'. In a lengthier post, Mr Zelenskyy said the pair \"discussed the challenges facing Ukraine and all of Europe, coordination with partners, concrete steps to strengthen Ukraine's position, and ending the war with a just peace, along with robust security guarantees\". He also announced a new loan agreement signed over a videocall today by chancellor Rachel Reeves and Ukrainian finance minister Sergii Marchenko. The £2.26bn loan will \"enhance Ukraine's defence capabilities\" and \"be repaid using revenues from frozen Russian assets\", Mr Zelenskyy said. The Treasury said: \"The loan demonstrates the UK's commitment to Ukrainian defence. A strong Ukraine is vital to UK national security.\" As well as welcoming Mr Zelenskyy, Sir Keir has spoken to US President Trump and French President Emmanuel Macron today. Sky News understands the calls were constructive and focused on finding a way forward. Two entirely different White House meetings  Both the Ukrainian president and the British prime minister visited the White House this week - but the two meetings had very different outcomes.  Sir Keir won over Mr Trump in the Oval Office on Thursday as he presented the US president with a letter from the King, inviting him to the UK for an historic second state visit. But Mr Zelenskyy's meeting in the same room - just 24 hours later - descended into a fiery shouting match. The Ukrainian president had travelled to Washington DC to attempt to secure a Russia ceasefire agreement and a possible mineral deal with the US.

The Ukrainian president then left early and the rest of the day's engagements, including a news conference, were hastily cancelled. His plane, emblazoned with the Ukrainian flag, touched down at London's Stansted airport and was met by a convoy of cars this morning."

Volodymyr Zelenskyy had travelled to Washington DC as he was due to clinch a deal on minerals with the US on Friday, but he left empty handed after a heated exchange in the Oval Office. Under the watch of the world's media, the final ten minutes of the meeting descended into a shouting match, as both Mr Trump and his vice president, JD Vance, accused Mr Zelenskyy of being \"ungrateful\". Mr Trump berated Mr Zelenskyy as \"disrespectful\", while the Ukrainian leader tried to defend himself. Kyiv citizens speaking to Sky News have said they stand by their president - despite calls from the US for him to stand down and hold an election.

When asked about the future of Ukraine, he said if he was not sure the country had a future, then he would not have stayed. 'Maybe America changed their mind' Alla said she was \"very disappointed\" by how the conversation had played out. \"We were hoping for peace,\" she said. She said this morning it felt like \"everything had changed, but we are hoping for the best anyway\". \"Ukraine is strong and will stand. That is our power.\" When asked about the potential withdrawal of US support, she said: \"I hope Europe will help us. And I think maybe America also changed their mind, because I've seen a lot of American people who say they are sorry for Trump's words, saying 'I'm sorry, we are not Trump. We don't think like this'.\" 'Our president was right' Svitlana, 52, said simply: \"Our president was right - we have no choice. Of course we want peace, we want a ceasefire, but Putin will not do that. \"He does not want peace. He wants to continue to totally destroy us.\" She said how, during the Oval Office meeting, a drone attacked medical facilities and other targets in Kharkiv, the country's second largest city, injuring at least seven people, according to local officials.

        "Content": "Israel will adopt a proposal for an extension to the first phase of the ceasefire in Gaza, the office of the Israeli prime minister has announced.\n The plan by US Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff was for an extension lasting for the periods of Ramadan and Passover. Gaza ceasefire explained The holy month of Ramadan started on Friday and is usually between 29 and 30 days. Pictures emerged from Gaza of Palestinians celebrating among the rubble. The Jewish holiday of Passover is shorter, but this year finishes on Sunday 20 April. The announcement came just after the first phase of the previously agreed ceasefire expired on Saturday. Phase one halted 15 months of fighting and saw the release of 33 Israeli hostages held in Gaza and five Thai nationals, in exchange for around 2,000 Palestinian prisoners and detainees. \n                  Government calls 'urgent meeting' with BBC over controversial Gaza documentary\n                 \n                  Trump shares AI video of Gaza vision featuring golden statues, bearded belly dancers and Netanyahu on a sunbed\n                 \n                  Operation Iron Wall: West Bank areas 'turning into mini-Gaza' as Israeli troops bulldoze homes\n                 The extension would push back phase two of the ceasefire, which was intended to introduce talks to bring about a permanent end to the war. Hamas said earlier on Saturday the group rejected Israel's \"formulation\" of extending the first phase of the ceasefire in Gaza, but did not explicitly mention Mr Witkoff's plan. It isn't clear what Hamas's response to this plan is yet. Both sides have previously traded accusations that the other violated the fragile ceasefire. Meanwhile, talks on the long-term future of Gaza are yet to seriously materialise after the UN said it would take decades to rebuild the enclave. Israeli statement A statement from the prime minister's office originally published in Hebrew said that on the first day of the proposed extension, half of the hostages and bodies of the dead would be released. It added that at the end, if an agreement on a permanent ceasefire was reached, the remaining hostages and bodies would also be released. The statement added: \"Witkoff proposed the outline for extending the ceasefire after he was impressed that at this stage there was no possibility of bridging the positions of the parties to end the war, and that additional time was needed for talks on a permanent ceasefire.\" It went on to add that Israel could return to fighting \"after the 42nd day if it feels that the negotiations are ineffective\", pointing out that this was supported by the Trump administration. It isn't clear what dates these days correspond to. Contention over the extension Two Palestinian officials familiar with the negotiations told Reuters that Israel refused to enter phase two of the agreement or start negotiations about it. Instead, they said that Israel requested an extension of the first phase, conditioned on the handover of a number of hostages and bodies for each week of the extension. Hamas however, Reuters reported, rejected this and insisted on sticking to the original agreement and entering into the second phase, as was previously agreed.

It added that they rejected Israel's proposal to extend the ceasefire for four weeks, with hostage releases, without officially entering the second phase."

        "Content": "\n          Arts and entertainment reporter\n              @BethanyMinelle\n Charli XCX has continued her Brat domination at the BRITs, winning five awards, including album of the year. This year's most nominated artist, she took the first prize of the night, best song, telling the crowd: \"I'm really happy that a song about underwear now has a Brit award, very important stuff and I'm sure that that proves something about songwriting but I'm not quite sure what.\" The 32-year-old, whose real name is Charlotte Aitchison, went on to win best dance act and artist of the year, joking that there had been complaints about her sheer top, and adding \"free the nipple\". Taking the top prize of the night, best album, she said: \"I used to tell myself awards weren't important, and that was easy to do as until last year I wasn't nominated for anything. \"I always felt like an outsider, particularly in the British music industry, it feels really nice to get recognition for this album. I've not changed anything… I guess culture caught up with us and wanted to be on this journey.\" She'd already picked up BRIT songwriter of the year award earlier this week. Her success follows a Brat Summer, which saw her sixth album - featuring \"slime green\" artwork - go viral, influencing the US presidential campaign of Kamala Harris and making it into the Collins Dictionary as word of the year. \n                  Brit Awards moments: Sabrina Carpenter rules Britannia, and a tribute to Liam Payne\n                 \n                  BRIT Awards 2025 fashion: The best of the red carpet looks\n                 \n                  BRIT Awards 2025 fashion: The best of the red carpet looks\n                 Charli won three Grammys for the album earlier this month. Read more:Brit Awards momentsThe best of the BRITs red carpet fashionWhat is Brat?How has pop music changed over the years? The biggest night in British music, the ceremony at London's O2 arena was hosted by comedian Jack Whitehall, who was back for the fifth time. There were live performances by artists including Sabrina Carpenter, who opened proceedings, Myles Smith and Sam Fender. Former Little Mix star JADE took her first solo award for best pop act, presented by girl band Sugababes. She thanked her fans for their support, her parents for \"for making me feel like it was a realistic goal to be a pop star ever since I was a little girl,\" and her former bandmates who she said changed her life. British singer-songwriter Myles Smith - whose single Stargazing became one of the UK's biggest hits of 2024 - had previously been named as this year's rising star. His award was presented to him on the night by last year's winners The Last Dinner Party. The singer-songwriter - who said he was from what has been called \"the worst town in Luton,\" raised by a single mother - asked the government why they treated the British music industry \"as an afterthought\". He also asked big music venues what they were doing to help keep grassroots venues alive, as well as highlighting the importance of music managers supporting stars beyond their first hit. British jazz quintet Ezra Collective took group of the year, paying tribute to the \"great youth clubs, great schools, and great teachers\" inspiring young people to take up music. Alaos announced ahead of the ceremony, Sabrina Carpenter became the first international artist to receive the global success award after breaking records in the UK charts. She held the top spot on the Official UK Charts for a combined 21 weeks in 2024, the first artist to do so in 71 years. Her mega-hits Taste, Please Please Please and Espresso also held the top three spots simultaneously, making her the first female artist to do so. A pre-recorded video by music legend Diana Ross led into her award, which was given to her by her close friend, Stranger Things star Millie Bobby Brown. Accepting her prize, Carpenter spoke about coming to the UK with her mother previously when no one knew who she was, and now coming back and \"getting to headline the O2\". She also spoke about her appreciation of British humour, saying \"your humour is so, so dry,\" and her admiration for the British love of caffeine, mainly via a nice cup of tea. Chappell Roan took song of the year for Good Luck, Babe! as well as international artist of the year. Stormzy thanked Jesus for his win in the hip-hop, grime, rap act category, saying he thought fellow nominee, Central Cee, was rap artist of the year. Apologising for wearing his sunglasses on stage, which he said was because he'd \"mashed up his eye playing padel\" (a sporting mash-up of tennis, squash, and badminton), he read a short Biblical quote as he accepted his prize. Raye took British R&B act. Last year she made BRITs history when she secured six awards, the most by an artist in a single year. Irish post-punk band Fontaines DC took international group of the year for the second time. British indie rock act The Last Dinner Party took best new artist after winning the BAFTA rising star award last year. They called small independent venues the \"lifeblood of the music industry\", adding, \"we wouldn't be here without them\". At the end of the night there was a special tribute to former One Direction star Liam Payne, who died in October following a fall from a hotel balcony at the age of 31.

        "Content": "\n          Culture and entertainment reporter\n              @gemmapeplow\n This was Charli XCX's big night. Best artist, best album, best song, and more. The Brat singer took home five awards in total, including the songwriter of the year prize announced ahead of the ceremony. Elsewhere, last year's record-breaking Brits winner Raye took home the best RnB act prize, and there were also awards for Sam Fender, Fontaines DC and former Little Mix star Jade, who gave a shout-out to her bandmates in her acceptance speech. As usual, there were several memorable moments throughout the ceremony. Starting with the opener... Espresso/ Rule Britannia Sabrina Carpenter understood the assignment. Think Geri Halliwell's Union Jack tea towel dress in 1996, Dua Lipa's tube arrival in 2021. The British stars know we love to see the United Kingdom celebrated, but US star Sabrina Carpenter could have been forgiven for going without the pomp and ceremony. But no. She really did her homework. Wearing a red sparkly military-style blazer dress and walking down an aisle lit up with the Union flag, the star was followed by dancing Beefeaters as she launched into Espresso. A mash-up into Rule Britannia followed, before she moved on to perform a cheeky rendition of Bed Chem. We can only applaud.  The star later went on to collect the global success award - announced by none other than music icon Diana Ross, who livestreamed into the ceremony from a show in New York. Collecting the prize on stage, Carpenter recalled coming to the UK for the first time 10 years ago when she said only about 10 people knew who she was. Next week, she's back at the O2 Arena to headline. The Espresso singer added: \"The Brits have given me this award, and this feels like such an insane honour in a very primarily tea-drinking country... you really understood my dry sense of humour because your sense of humour is so, so dry. So I love y'all more than you even understand.\" Calls to save the grassroots Rising star winner Myles Smith may be a newcomer to the Brit Awards, but he wasn't afraid to use the stage to let his thoughts on the state of the music industry be known. The 26-year-old, who performed his songs Nice To Meet You and Stargazing, told the audience that while he had the \"attention of the nation\" he wanted to ask three questions, with his first to the government. \"If British music is one of the most powerful cultural exports we have, why have you treated it like an afterthought for so many years?\" he said. \"How many more venues need to close? How many more music programmes need to be cut before we realise that we can't just celebrate success, you have to protect the foundations that make it?\" Smith went on to question major venues: \"If artists selling out your arenas and your stadiums started in grassroots venues, what are you doing to keep them alive?\" Finally, \"to the execs in the room, and to the people behind the scenes\", he asked: \"Are we building careers or are we just chasing moments?\" In November last year, plans were announced for a voluntary levy on tickets for concerts at stadiums and arenas to help fund grassroots venues after the closures of high numbers in recent years. Femi Koleoso of Ezra Collective also spoke about the importance of nurturing young artists as the jazz group collected the group of the year award, saying they are where they are now \"because of the great youth clubs, and the great teachers and the great schools that support young people playing music\". Bass player Georgia Davies, of indie group The Last Dinner Party, also spoke about the importance of saving independent music venues. \"We wouldn't be a band, and a lot of the artists here would not be bands either, without the UK's incredible independent venues, and they are the lifeblood of the music industry and they are dying,\" she said, as the band collected the best new artist award. Jack Whitehall's return It's been four years since comedian Jack Whitehall was last at the helm of the Brits. He made his comeback with gags about Stormzy - \"the grime scene's Ronald McDonald\", in light of his controversial collaboration with the fast food chain - and dynamic pricing, following the ticket sale for the Oasis reunion gigs announced last year. Whitehall's jokes also included a skit sending up Kanye West and Bianca Censori's infamous Grammy red carpet appearance last month, when Censori dropped her coat to show an incredibly revealing dress and no underwear. This time round, it was Whitehall's parents, Michael and Hilary, preparing to shock the paps. \"It's nothing you haven't seen before, Jack,\" his mum shouted. Stormzy doesn't agree with fan vote The rapper was named best hip-hop/ grime act, one of the genre awards which are voted for by the public. Wearing sunglasses on stage, he told the audience he had hurt his eye playing padel. The 31-year-old said that while he was grateful to the Brits and those who had voted, he did not \"entirely\" agree with the way the genre prizes are chosen. \"I don't entirely think this award should be fan-voted,\" Stormzy said. \"I don't think any of the awards should be fan-voted, not on a controversial one. I don't know, sometimes I think it doesn't let people have their moments. \"I think Cench (Central Cee) was the rap artist of the year, but these things don't define us as much as they're amazing and we love them. I'm very grateful to the Brits, and I'm grateful to the public.\" Chappell Roan's tribute As well as Charli XCX and Carpenter, it was a big night for US star Chappell Roan, who won the awards for best international artist and best international song, for Good Luck, Babe! The singer could not attend the ceremony but recorded acceptance speeches, and dedicated her artist award to trans artists, drag queens, fashion students, sex workers and the late Sinead O'Connor. \"Thank you to my team and my fans all over the world, but especially to my UK girlies, you have been there since day one, and Chappell Roan was born through experiencing queer joy,\" she said. \"It's so special, I had to write an entire album about it. I dedicate this to trans artists, to drag queens, to fashion students, sex workers and Sinead O'Connor. Because of all those people, they have laid the groundwork for me to be here today.\" 'So many amazing memories of Liam' Whitehall said the Brits had to pay tribute to Liam Payne, who was someone who played such a huge part in the show over the years. The 31-year-old died in October, after falling from a hotel balcony in Argentina. Read more:The best of the Brits red carpet fashionWhat is Brat?How has pop music changed over the years? Paying tribute, Whitehall said Payne had \"achieved so much in the short time that he was on this Earth, and was not only a supremely gifted musician, but an incredibly kind soul who touched the lives of everyone he came into contact with\". He continued: \"We have so many amazing memories of Liam here at the Brits, so tonight we celebrate his legacy.\" A video was then played showing clips of the singer with his family, as well as footage from his time as a contestant on The X Factor and with One Direction. Payne won seven awards with One Direction during the band's time together, and also performed at the event when he launched his solo career."

        "Content": "David Johansen, the singer from seminal punk band the New York Dolls, has died at the age of 75. Formed in the early 1970s, the New York Dolls redefined rock and roll, providing the blueprint for British punk bands such as the Sex Pistols and The Clash, and inspiring the glam-metal movement. Johansen died \"peacefully\" at his home in New York City on Friday, his family said. He was \"holding the hands of his wife Mara Hennessey and stepdaughter Leah, in the sunlight surrounded by music and flowers\", they added. Johansen's death comes just weeks after the singer's family said he had stage 4 cancer and a brain tumour. His daughter Leah shared the diagnosis as she launched a crowdfunding campaign to help cover healthcare costs. Sharing news of the singer's death on the page, his family said: \"He was thankful that he had a chance to be in touch with so many friends and family before he passed. \"He knew he was ecstatically loved.\" There will be \"several events celebrating David's life and artistry\" announced in due course, they added. Johansen began his career as a singer with the Vagabond Missionaries in the late 1960s, before being invited to join the New York Dolls in 1971. While the band - whose tracks include Personality Crisis and Looking For A Kiss - were critically acclaimed, they never found commercial success and broke up after two albums by the middle of the decade. Despite their split after just five years, the Dolls' presence in the early punk scene had an undeniable impact on the music world. More from Sky News:BRIT Awards' best red carpet looksOscars 2025 predictions  Shortly after their demise, the band were quoted as a major influence on British bands including The Clash, The Damned and the Sex Pistols - whose deprecating track New York is about the Dolls. Their style - women's clothes, heavy makeup and teased hair - inspired the glam-metal movement that emerged with acts such as Mötley Crüe a decade later. Johansen embarked on a solo career after the band split and released albums under both his own name and the pseudonym Buster Poindexter. In 2004, the band's three surviving members - Johansen, Arthur 'Killer' Kane' and Sylvain Sylvain - reunited and continued performing until 2011. Johansen is survived by his wife, Mara, and stepdaughter, Leah."

        "Content": "\n          Political correspondent\n              @amandaakass\n  After the detonation of global diplomacy we saw in the White House on Friday, all eyes are now on Downing Street. Following his early exit from the Oval Office, Volodymyr Zelenskyy has left Washington and flown directly to the UK for an urgent meeting with Sir Keir Starmer ahead of Sunday's summit with European leaders. It's an event which has been brought forward by a day, such is the anxiety about the unprecedented public breakdown in the relationship between the US and the Ukrainians. After the verbal beating meted out by Donald Trump and JD Vance, walking into Number 10 for a tete-a-tete with one of his staunchest allies will surely be something of a relief for the Ukrainian president. But the question is what they can do to try and salvage the situation. Ukraine latest: Zelenskyy meets UK PM  After replaying the humiliating row in his head all night, Mr Zelenskyy has issued a detailed statement defending his position. Clearly bruised by the vice president's unfounded claims about a lack of gratitude, he repeatedly thanked Mr Trump and the American people for their support. But the fundamentals of his position - and the roots of that row with the Trump administration - remain unchanged. He reiterated his argument that Vladimir Putin has repeatedly broken ceasefires in the past and cannot be trusted not to do so in the future without strong US security guarantees. \"Once these guarantees are in place, we can talk with Russia, Europe and the US about diplomacy,\" he said. \"I want the US to stand more firmly on our side.\" Given his outright hostility to Mr Zelenskyy, it's not a message Mr Trump seems in any mood to hear. But it is effectively the position of the UK government too. Sir Keir has pledged his willingness to put British boots on the ground as part of a European peacekeeping force, in the event of a peace deal - but only if the US agrees to provide a security \"backstop\" to deter Mr Putin from attacking again. Read more:Starmer in crisis talks with ZelenskyyPope not out of danger, Vatican sources sayTrump 'offended' by Zelenskyy's outfit  Sunday's summit - hosted by Sir Keir and bringing together Mr Zelenskyy with a group of key European leaders - was meant to cap off a week of busy diplomacy. The British prime minister and French President Emmanuel Macron had clearly hoped to build on the success of their own visits to the White House and drum up further offers of support for their European peacekeeping plan. Now that diplomatic momentum has been stopped in its tracks. Would the Europeans even consider going it alone, without the Americans? It was previously an unthinkable question, involving inconceivable increases in defence spending. But the continent's leaders have been relatively united in expressing their unshakeable backing for Mr Zelenskyy. Surely they will need to discuss how far they would be prepared to go if Mr Trump followed through with his threats to cancel American support completely. The prime minister only had a few hours to bask in the glow of his own unexpectedly successful trip to the White House on Thursday before Mr Zelenskyy's visit blew up in such an extreme fashion. Now his position as Mr Trump's new best friend (with the \"lovely accent\") will be tested much more quickly than anyone had predicted. Will the prime minister be able to leverage their special relationship to stand up for Mr Zelenskyy and resurrect American support for Ukraine? He's regularly talked about acting as a bridge between Europe and the US. But it's an increasingly impossible task when the two continents are pulling themselves apart."

        "Content": "Sir Keir Starmer has offered his \"unwavering support\" to Ukraine – saying \"we're at a turning point\" following a fiery Oval Office exchange between Volodymyr Zelenskyy and Donald Trump.  The prime minister welcomed Mr Zelenskyy to Downing Street on Saturday, where they signed a new loan deal for Ukraine following his disastrous meeting with the US president on Friday. On Sunday, the pair will be joined by dozens of world leaders for a summit on Ukraine and security. Ukraine latest: Zelenskyy to meet King Charles Sir Keir will start the day by speaking to Italian PM Giorgia Meloni, before they are joined by French President Emmanuel Macron and leaders from countries including Germany, Denmark, Norway, Poland, Canada, Finland and Romania. Turkey's foreign minister, the EU's Ursula von der Leyen and NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte will also attend. In a statement issued ahead of the meeting, Sir Keir said he \"will reaffirm my unwavering support for Ukraine and double down on my commitment to provide capacity, training and aid\" - in order to put the country \"in the strongest possible position\". \n                  Starmer's position as Trump's new best friend will be tested much more quickly than anyone predicted\n                 \n                  Zelenskyy says he is 'truly thankful' to US after Trump row - as he arrives in UK for summit\n                 \n                  NHS 'not up for grabs' in US-UK trade deal, says Wes Streeting\n                 He continued: \"In partnership with our allies, we must intensify our preparations for the European element of security guarantees alongside continued discussions with the United States. \"We have an opportunity to come together to ensure a just and lasting peace in Ukraine that secures their sovereignty and security. \"Now is the time for us to unite in order to guarantee the best outcome for Ukraine, protect European security, and secure our collective future.\" Zelenskyy's visit to Downing Street Sir Keir's statement came after he welcomed Mr Zelenskyy to Downing Street with a hug. The pair spoke briefly, before Mr Zelenskyy waved at reporters and gave a thumbs up. They then shook hands as they posed for pictures outside the door of No 10.  As they sat down inside, Sir Keir told Mr Zelenskyy: \"You have full backing across the United Kingdom and we stand with you, with Ukraine, for as long as it may take. \"I hope you heard some of that cheering in the street,\" he continued, saying the cheers signified \"our absolute determination to stand with you - unwavering determination - and to achieve what we both want to achieve, which is a lasting peace.\" Sir Keir added: \"A lasting peace for Ukraine based on sovereignty and security for Ukraine - so important for Ukraine, so important for Europe and so important for the United Kingdom.\" \"So I'm much looking forward to our discussions here this afternoon - thank you very much for making the time to come,\" he said. Mr Zelenskyy replied that he was \"happy to be here\". \"I want to thank you, the people of the United Kingdom and the King,\" he said, noting he will be meeting the monarch tomorrow. \"We count on your support,\" he continued. \"We're really happy we have such partners and such friends.\" A new loan deal for Ukraine Sir Keir and Mr Zelenskyy both posted on X following their meeting, with the British prime minister saying it was an \"honour\" to welcome the Ukrainian leader to No 10. He signed off his post with \"Slava Ukraini\", which means 'Glory to Ukraine'. In a lengthier post, Mr Zelenskyy said the pair \"discussed the challenges facing Ukraine and all of Europe, coordination with partners, concrete steps to strengthen Ukraine's position, and ending the war with a just peace, along with robust security guarantees\". He also announced a new loan agreement signed over a videocall today by chancellor Rachel Reeves and Ukrainian finance minister Sergii Marchenko. The £2.26bn loan will \"enhance Ukraine's defence capabilities\" and \"be repaid using revenues from frozen Russian assets\", Mr Zelenskyy said. The Treasury said: \"The loan demonstrates the UK's commitment to Ukrainian defence. A strong Ukraine is vital to UK national security.\" As well as welcoming Mr Zelenskyy, Sir Keir has spoken to US President Trump and French President Emmanuel Macron today. Sky News understands the calls were constructive and focused on finding a way forward. Two entirely different White House meetings  Both the Ukrainian president and the British prime minister visited the White House this week - but the two meetings had very different outcomes.  Sir Keir won over Mr Trump in the Oval Office on Thursday as he presented the US president with a letter from the King, inviting him to the UK for an historic second state visit. But Mr Zelenskyy's meeting in the same room - just 24 hours later - descended into a fiery shouting match. The Ukrainian president had travelled to Washington DC to attempt to secure a Russia ceasefire agreement and a possible mineral deal with the US. Read more:Trump and Zelenskyy body language explainedHow Starmer secured wins at the White HouseZelenskyy refuses to apologise for Oval Office row His first engagement at the White House was a sit down with Mr Trump and his vice president JD Vance - which ended with the pair accusing Mr Zelenskyy of being \"disrespectful\" and \"gambling with World War Three\". The Ukrainian president then left early and the rest of the day's engagements, including a news conference, were hastily cancelled. His plane, emblazoned with the Ukrainian flag, touched down at London's Stansted airport and was met by a convoy of cars this morning."

Taking the top prize of the night, best album, she said: \"I used to tell myself awards weren't important, and that was easy to do as until last year I wasn't nominated for anything. \"I always felt like an outsider, particularly in the British music industry, it feels really nice to get recognition for this album. I've not changed anything… I guess culture caught up with us and wanted to be on this journey.\" She'd already picked up BRIT songwriter of the year award earlier this week.

Read more:Brit Awards momentsThe best of the BRITs red carpet fashionWhat is Brat?How has pop music changed over the years? The biggest night in British music, the ceremony at London's O2 arena was hosted by comedian Jack Whitehall, who was back for the fifth time. There were live performances by artists including Sabrina Carpenter, who opened proceedings, Myles Smith and Sam Fender. Former Little Mix star JADE took her first solo award for best pop act, presented by girl band Sugababes. She thanked her fans for their support, her parents for \"for making me feel like it was a realistic goal to be a pop star ever since I was a little girl,\" and her former bandmates who she said changed her life. British singer-songwriter Myles Smith - whose single Stargazing became one of the UK's biggest hits of 2024 - had previously been named as this year's rising star. His award was presented to him on the night by last year's winners The Last Dinner Party. The singer-songwriter - who said he was from what has been called \"the worst town in Luton,\" raised by a single mother - asked the government why they treated the British music industry \"as an afterthought\". He also asked big music venues what they were doing to help keep grassroots venues alive, as well as highlighting the importance of music managers supporting stars beyond their first hit. British jazz quintet Ezra Collective took group of the year, paying tribute to the \"great youth clubs, great schools, and great teachers\" inspiring young people to take up music. Alaos announced ahead of the ceremony, Sabrina Carpenter became the first international artist to receive the global success award after breaking records in the UK charts. She held the top spot on the Official UK Charts for a combined 21 weeks in 2024, the first artist to do so in 71 years. Her mega-hits Taste, Please Please Please and Espresso also held the top three spots simultaneously, making her the first female artist to do so. A pre-recorded video by music legend Diana Ross led into her award, which was given to her by her close friend, Stranger Things star Millie Bobby Brown. Accepting her prize, Carpenter spoke about coming to the UK with her mother previously when no one knew who she was, and now coming back and \"getting to headline the O2\". She also spoke about her appreciation of British humour, saying \"your humour is so, so dry,\" and her admiration for the British love of caffeine, mainly via a nice cup of tea. Chappell Roan took song of the year for Good Luck, Babe! as well as international artist of the year. Stormzy thanked Jesus for his win in the hip-hop, grime, rap act category, saying he thought fellow nominee, Central Cee, was rap artist of the year. Apologising for wearing his sunglasses on stage, which he said was because he'd \"mashed up his eye playing padel\" (a sporting mash-up of tennis, squash, and badminton), he read a short Biblical quote as he accepted his prize. Raye took British R&B act. Last year she made BRITs history when she secured six awards, the most by an artist in a single year. Irish post-punk band Fontaines DC took international group of the year for the second time. British indie rock act The Last Dinner Party took best new artist after winning the BAFTA rising star award last year. They called small independent venues the \"lifeblood of the music industry\", adding, \"we wouldn't be here without them\". At the end of the night there was a special tribute to former One Direction star Liam Payne, who died in October following a fall from a hotel balcony at the age of 31.

        "Content": "\n          Culture and entertainment reporter\n              @gemmapeplow\n This was Charli XCX's big night. Best artist, best album, best song, and more. The Brat singer took home five awards in total, including the songwriter of the year prize announced ahead of the ceremony. Elsewhere, last year's record-breaking Brits winner Raye took home the best RnB act prize, and there were also awards for Sam Fender, Fontaines DC and former Little Mix star Jade, who gave a shout-out to her bandmates in her acceptance speech. As usual, there were several memorable moments throughout the ceremony. Starting with the opener... Espresso/ Rule Britannia Sabrina Carpenter understood the assignment. Think Geri Halliwell's Union Jack tea towel dress in 1996, Dua Lipa's tube arrival in 2021. The British stars know we love to see the United Kingdom celebrated, but US star Sabrina Carpenter could have been forgiven for going without the pomp and ceremony. But no. She really did her homework. Wearing a red sparkly military-style blazer dress and walking down an aisle lit up with the Union flag, the star was followed by dancing Beefeaters as she launched into Espresso. A mash-up into Rule Britannia followed, before she moved on to perform a cheeky rendition of Bed Chem. We can only applaud.  The star later went on to collect the global success award - announced by none other than music icon Diana Ross, who livestreamed into the ceremony from a show in New York. Collecting the prize on stage, Carpenter recalled coming to the UK for the first time 10 years ago when she said only about 10 people knew who she was. Next week, she's back at the O2 Arena to headline. The Espresso singer added: \"The Brits have given me this award, and this feels like such an insane honour in a very primarily tea-drinking country... you really understood my dry sense of humour because your sense of humour is so, so dry. So I love y'all more than you even understand.\" Calls to save the grassroots Rising star winner Myles Smith may be a newcomer to the Brit Awards, but he wasn't afraid to use the stage to let his thoughts on the state of the music industry be known. The 26-year-old, who performed his songs Nice To Meet You and Stargazing, told the audience that while he had the \"attention of the nation\" he wanted to ask three questions, with his first to the government. \"If British music is one of the most powerful cultural exports we have, why have you treated it like an afterthought for so many years?\" he said. \"How many more venues need to close? How many more music programmes need to be cut before we realise that we can't just celebrate success, you have to protect the foundations that make it?\" Smith went on to question major venues: \"If artists selling out your arenas and your stadiums started in grassroots venues, what are you doing to keep them alive?\" Finally, \"to the execs in the room, and to the people behind the scenes\", he asked: \"Are we building careers or are we just chasing moments?\" In November last year, plans were announced for a voluntary levy on tickets for concerts at stadiums and arenas to help fund grassroots venues after the closures of high numbers in recent years. Femi Koleoso of Ezra Collective also spoke about the importance of nurturing young artists as the jazz group collected the group of the year award, saying they are where they are now \"because of the great youth clubs, and the great teachers and the great schools that support young people playing music\". Bass player Georgia Davies, of indie group The Last Dinner Party, also spoke about the importance of saving independent music venues. \"We wouldn't be a band, and a lot of the artists here would not be bands either, without the UK's incredible independent venues, and they are the lifeblood of the music industry and they are dying,\" she said, as the band collected the best new artist award. Jack Whitehall's return It's been four years since comedian Jack Whitehall was last at the helm of the Brits. He made his comeback with gags about Stormzy - \"the grime scene's Ronald McDonald\", in light of his controversial collaboration with the fast food chain - and dynamic pricing, following the ticket sale for the Oasis reunion gigs announced last year. Whitehall's jokes also included a skit sending up Kanye West and Bianca Censori's infamous Grammy red carpet appearance last month, when Censori dropped her coat to show an incredibly revealing dress and no underwear. This time round, it was Whitehall's parents, Michael and Hilary, preparing to shock the paps. \"It's nothing you haven't seen before, Jack,\" his mum shouted. Stormzy doesn't agree with fan vote The rapper was named best hip-hop/ grime act, one of the genre awards which are voted for by the public. Wearing sunglasses on stage, he told the audience he had hurt his eye playing padel. The 31-year-old said that while he was grateful to the Brits and those who had voted, he did not \"entirely\" agree with the way the genre prizes are chosen. \"I don't entirely think this award should be fan-voted,\" Stormzy said. \"I don't think any of the awards should be fan-voted, not on a controversial one. I don't know, sometimes I think it doesn't let people have their moments. \"I think Cench (Central Cee) was the rap artist of the year, but these things don't define us as much as they're amazing and we love them. I'm very grateful to the Brits, and I'm grateful to the public.\" Chappell Roan's tribute As well as Charli XCX and Carpenter, it was a big night for US star Chappell Roan, who won the awards for best international artist and best international song, for Good Luck, Babe! The singer could not attend the ceremony but recorded acceptance speeches, and dedicated her artist award to trans artists, drag queens, fashion students, sex workers and the late Sinead O'Connor. \"Thank you to my team and my fans all over the world, but especially to my UK girlies, you have been there since day one, and Chappell Roan was born through experiencing queer joy,\" she said. \"It's so special, I had to write an entire album about it. I dedicate this to trans artists, to drag queens, to fashion students, sex workers and Sinead O'Connor. Because of all those people, they have laid the groundwork for me to be here today.\" 'So many amazing memories of Liam' Whitehall said the Brits had to pay tribute to Liam Payne, who was someone who played such a huge part in the show over the years. The 31-year-old died in October, after falling from a hotel balcony in Argentina. Read more:The best of the Brits red carpet fashionWhat is Brat?How has pop music changed over the years? Paying tribute, Whitehall said Payne had \"achieved so much in the short time that he was on this Earth, and was not only a supremely gifted musician, but an incredibly kind soul who touched the lives of everyone he came into contact with\". He continued: \"We have so many amazing memories of Liam here at the Brits, so tonight we celebrate his legacy.\" A video was then played showing clips of the singer with his family, as well as footage from his time as a contestant on The X Factor and with One Direction. Payne won seven awards with One Direction during the band's time together, and also performed at the event when he launched his solo career."

        "Content": "A Premier League star is conscious in hospital with a head injury after a head-high foul in an FA Cup tie that his club's chairman called \"the most reckless\" challenge he had ever seen. Crystal Palace co-owner Steve Parish said Jean-Philippe Mateta has a \"bad gash behind his ear and a head injury so far as we know\" after Millwall goalkeeper Liam Roberts kicked him in the head as they battled for the ball early in the lunchtime fifth-round match at Selhurst Park. French forward Mateta, 27, received 10 minutes of medical attention after the foul but could not continue and was stretchered off wearing a neck brace before being taken straight to hospital. Mateta is \"conscious\", Palace manager Oliver Glasner said after the game and videos posted to social media showed him making a clenched fist gesture towards Palace fans as he was taken away. Referee Michael Oliver initially took no action, but after checking the pitchside monitor, he sent off Roberts, 30. Roberts \"needs to have a long hard look at himself because he's endangering a fellow professional with a challenge like that\", Parish told the BBC at half-time in the FA Cup fifth round tie between the south London rivals. Noting Roberts' age, he said it was \"the most reckless challenge on a football pitch I think I've ever seen. \n                  FA Cup: 'Hapless' FA criticised by lower-league clubs for scrapping potential money-spinning replays\n                 \n                  West Brom v Wolves: Officers injured and arrests made after 'completely unacceptable' violence at FA Cup tie\n                 \n                  Gary Lineker criticised for calling top flight of Welsh football a 'farmer's league'\n                 \"There's a lot of emotion but we need to talk about that challenge. In all the time I've watched football I've never seen a challenge like it. He later told Sky Sports: \"I think he [Mateta] is OK, I've had a message from his agents. \"It's a head injury so you don't really know, but he's got a really bad gash. I think his ear is almost in half. It's a bad one but I've said what I've said.\" Many were reminded of a notorious foul by West Germany 'keeper Harald Schumacher on France defender Patrick Battiston in the 1982 World Cup semi-final. Battiston was concussed and lost three teeth after the head-high challenge, while Schumacher escaped punishment. Glasner told BBC Sport Mateta's ear \"looks terrible\", calling it a \"very serious injury\". Asked about the victory which puts the Eagles into the quarter-finals, he said the injury meant he \"can't be really happy... when you lose a player with a foul like this, you have two different feelings in your stomach\". He said he was sure Roberts \"didn't want to injure JP [Mateta]\", but \"if you go [to] the ball like this with the intensity in the head, you just can't do it because it's so dangerous. I don't want to blame him, but it's a terrible foul\". Both Glasner and Parish passed on their best wishes to Mateta. Millwall boss Alex Neil told BBC Sport he didn't \"think there's any intent\" in Roberts' challenge. \"I certainly wouldn't label it as the worst challenge I've seen. We don't want the lad to be injured so naturally, we wish Mateta well and hope he's back on the pitch soon,\" he said. \"For me, it's mistimed, he's been sent off, he's disappointed,\" Neil added. \"We wish Mateta well and it's nothing more than that for me.\" Neil admitted he had not watched video of the challenge.

But the governing body will not be investigating after some Millwall supporters were heard shouting \"let him die\" when Jean-Philippe Mateta was receiving medical treatment. It is understood that while the FA is aware of the chanting about Mateta and condemns offensive chants like this, they do not breach the body's regulations. Sky News has contacted Millwall and the FA for comment."

        "Content": "\n          Political correspondent\n              @amandaakass\n  After the detonation of global diplomacy we saw in the White House on Friday, all eyes are now on Downing Street. Following his early exit from the Oval Office, Volodymyr Zelenskyy has left Washington and flown directly to the UK for an urgent meeting with Sir Keir Starmer ahead of Sunday's summit with European leaders. It's an event which has been brought forward by a day, such is the anxiety about the unprecedented public breakdown in the relationship between the US and the Ukrainians. After the verbal beating meted out by Donald Trump and JD Vance, walking into Number 10 for a tete-a-tete with one of his staunchest allies will surely be something of a relief for the Ukrainian president. But the question is what they can do to try and salvage the situation. Ukraine latest: Zelenskyy meets UK PM  After replaying the humiliating row in his head all night, Mr Zelenskyy has issued a detailed statement defending his position. Clearly bruised by the vice president's unfounded claims about a lack of gratitude, he repeatedly thanked Mr Trump and the American people for their support. But the fundamentals of his position - and the roots of that row with the Trump administration - remain unchanged. He reiterated his argument that Vladimir Putin has repeatedly broken ceasefires in the past and cannot be trusted not to do so in the future without strong US security guarantees. \"Once these guarantees are in place, we can talk with Russia, Europe and the US about diplomacy,\" he said. \"I want the US to stand more firmly on our side.\" Given his outright hostility to Mr Zelenskyy, it's not a message Mr Trump seems in any mood to hear. But it is effectively the position of the UK government too. Sir Keir has pledged his willingness to put British boots on the ground as part of a European peacekeeping force, in the event of a peace deal - but only if the US agrees to provide a security \"backstop\" to deter Mr Putin from attacking again. Read more:Starmer in crisis talks with ZelenskyyPope not out of danger, Vatican sources sayTrump 'offended' by Zelenskyy's outfit  Sunday's summit - hosted by Sir Keir and bringing together Mr Zelenskyy with a group of key European leaders - was meant to cap off a week of busy diplomacy. The British prime minister and French President Emmanuel Macron had clearly hoped to build on the success of their own visits to the White House and drum up further offers of support for their European peacekeeping plan. Now that diplomatic momentum has been stopped in its tracks. Would the Europeans even consider going it alone, without the Americans? It was previously an unthinkable question, involving inconceivable increases in defence spending. But the continent's leaders have been relatively united in expressing their unshakeable backing for Mr Zelenskyy. Surely they will need to discuss how far they would be prepared to go if Mr Trump followed through with his threats to cancel American support completely. The prime minister only had a few hours to bask in the glow of his own unexpectedly successful trip to the White House on Thursday before Mr Zelenskyy's visit blew up in such an extreme fashion. Now his position as Mr Trump's new best friend (with the \"lovely accent\") will be tested much more quickly than anyone had predicted. Will the prime minister be able to leverage their special relationship to stand up for Mr Zelenskyy and resurrect American support for Ukraine? He's regularly talked about acting as a bridge between Europe and the US. But it's an increasingly impossible task when the two continents are pulling themselves apart."

        "Content": "\n          City editor\n              @MarkKleinmanSky\n A former chief executive of Aston Villa and Liverpool is a surprise contender to become the inaugural chairman of the government’s controversial football watchdog. Sky News can exclusively reveal that Christian Purslow, who left Villa Park in 2023, is on a three-person shortlist being considered by Whitehall officials to chair the Independent Football Regulator (IFR). Mr Purslow, an outspoken character who has spent much of his career in sports finance, was this weekend said to be a serious candidate for the job despite having publicly warned about the regulator's proposed remit and its potential impact on the Premier League. A former commercial chief at Chelsea Football Club, Mr Purslow spent an eventful 16 months in charge at Anfield, spearheading the sale of Liverpool to its current owners following a bitter fight with former principals Tom Hicks and George Gillett. He joined Aston Villa in 2018 when the club was in its third consecutive season in the Championship, seeing them promoted via the play-offs at the end of that campaign. It was unclear this weekend how much of the football pyramid would respond to the appointment of a chairman at the regulator who has been so closely associated with top-flight clubs, given ongoing disagreement between the Premier League and English Football League (EFL) about the future distribution of finances. One ally of Mr Purslow said, though, that his independence was not in doubt and that his experience of working outside the Premier League would also be valuable if he landed the IFR chairman role. \n                  The worst supermarkets for online grocery shopping substitutions revealed\n                 \n                  Money blog: 'The more ridiculous the better' - inside the world of extreme day-tripping\n                 \n                  Banks 'investing heavily' in digital platforms as payday glitch chaos strikes again \n                 Another senior football figure said Mr Purslow \"would be welcomed by the football community as someone who has worked in football, and not as a civil servant or politician\". In the past, Mr Purslow has both welcomed the prospect of further regulatory oversight of the sport, while also warning in a BBC interview in 2021, during his stint at Villa Park: \"The Premier League has really always been the source of funding for the rest of football and the danger here is killing the golden goose, if we over-regulate a highly successful and commercial operation. \"I think we have to be very careful as we contemplate reform that it does not ultimately damage the game. \"We already have a hugely successful English football Premier League - the most successful in the world.\" Two years later, however, he told Sky News' political editor, Beth Rigby: \"I like the idea that the government wants to be involved in our national sport. \"These [clubs] are hugely important institutions in their communities, economically and socially - so it's right that they [the government] are interested.\" The disclosure of Mr Purslow's candidacy means that two of the three shortlisted contenders for what will rank among the most powerful jobs in English football have now been identified by Sky News. On Friday, it emerged that Sanjay Bhandari, the chairman of Kick It Out, the football anti-racism charity, was also in the frame for the Manchester-based position, which will pay £130,000-a-year. A decision is expected in the coming weeks, with the third candidate expected to be a woman given the shift in Whitehall to gender-diverse shortlists for public appointments. The establishment of the regulator, which was originally conceived by the previous Conservative government in the wake of the furore over the failed European Super League project, has triggered deep unrest in the sport. This week, Steve Parish, the influential chairman of Premier League side Crystal Palace, told a sports industry conference organised by the Financial Times that the watchdog \"wants to interfere in all of the things we don't need them to interfere in and help with none of the things we actually need help with\". \"We have a problem that we're constantly being told that we're not a business and [that] we're part of the fabric of communities,\" he is reported to have said. \"At the same time, we're…being treated to the nth degree like a business.\" Interviews for the chair of the football regulator took place in November, with a previous recruitment process curtailed by the calling of last year's general election. Lisa Nandy, the culture secretary, will sign off on the appointment of a preferred candidate, with the chosen individual expected to face a pre-appointment hearing in front of the Commons culture, media and sport select committee. The Football Governance Bill is proceeding through parliament, with its next stage expected in March. It forms part of a process that represents the most fundamental shake-up in the oversight of English football in the game's history. The establishment of the body comes with the top tier of the professional game wracked by civil war, with Abu Dhabi-owned Manchester City at the centre of a number of legal cases over its financial dealings. The government has dropped a previous stipulation that the regulator should have regard to British foreign and trade policy when determining the appropriateness of a new club owner. The IFR will monitor clubs' adherence to rules requiring them to listen to fans' views on issues including ticket pricing, while it may also have oversight of the parachute payments made to clubs in the years after their relegation from the Premier League. The top flight has issued a statement expressing reservations about the regulator's remit, while the IFR has been broadly welcomed by the English Football League. A Department for Culture, Media and Sport spokesman said: \"We do not comment on speculation. \"No appointment has been made and the recruitment process for [IFR] chair is ongoing.\" Mr Purslow was abroad this weekend and did not respond to a request for comment."

        "Content": "Israel will adopt a proposal for an extension to the first phase of the ceasefire in Gaza, the office of the Israeli prime minister has announced.\n The plan by US Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff was for an extension lasting for the periods of Ramadan and Passover. Gaza ceasefire explained The holy month of Ramadan started on Friday and is usually between 29 and 30 days. Pictures emerged from Gaza of Palestinians celebrating among the rubble. The Jewish holiday of Passover is shorter, but this year finishes on Sunday 20 April. The announcement came just after the first phase of the previously agreed ceasefire expired on Saturday. Phase one halted 15 months of fighting and saw the release of 33 Israeli hostages held in Gaza and five Thai nationals, in exchange for around 2,000 Palestinian prisoners and detainees. \n                  Government calls 'urgent meeting' with BBC over controversial Gaza documentary\n                 \n                  Trump shares AI video of Gaza vision featuring golden statues, bearded belly dancers and Netanyahu on a sunbed\n                 \n                  Operation Iron Wall: West Bank areas 'turning into mini-Gaza' as Israeli troops bulldoze homes\n                 The extension would push back phase two of the ceasefire, which was intended to introduce talks to bring about a permanent end to the war. Hamas said earlier on Saturday the group rejected Israel's \"formulation\" of extending the first phase of the ceasefire in Gaza, but did not explicitly mention Mr Witkoff's plan. It isn't clear what Hamas's response to this plan is yet. Both sides have previously traded accusations that the other violated the fragile ceasefire. Meanwhile, talks on the long-term future of Gaza are yet to seriously materialise after the UN said it would take decades to rebuild the enclave. Israeli statement A statement from the prime minister's office originally published in Hebrew said that on the first day of the proposed extension, half of the hostages and bodies of the dead would be released. It added that at the end, if an agreement on a permanent ceasefire was reached, the remaining hostages and bodies would also be released. The statement added: \"Witkoff proposed the outline for extending the ceasefire after he was impressed that at this stage there was no possibility of bridging the positions of the parties to end the war, and that additional time was needed for talks on a permanent ceasefire.\" It went on to add that Israel could return to fighting \"after the 42nd day if it feels that the negotiations are ineffective\", pointing out that this was supported by the Trump administration. It isn't clear what dates these days correspond to. Contention over the extension Two Palestinian officials familiar with the negotiations told Reuters that Israel refused to enter phase two of the agreement or start negotiations about it. Instead, they said that Israel requested an extension of the first phase, conditioned on the handover of a number of hostages and bodies for each week of the extension. Hamas however, Reuters reported, rejected this and insisted on sticking to the original agreement and entering into the second phase, as was previously agreed.

It added that they rejected Israel's proposal to extend the ceasefire for four weeks, with hostage releases, without officially entering the second phase."

        "Content": " Volodymyr Zelenskyy was advised to wear a suit to the White House and Donald Trump was offended when he didn't, according to reports. Ahead of the historic meeting, the Ukrainian president was advised by Trump's team to ditch his usual military-style clothing for something more formal, Axios reports. However, he didn't, instead opting to wear all black. This irritated Mr Trump ahead of what quickly became a car crash of a meeting, according to two sources who spoke to Axios. Amid the ongoing conflict in Ukraine, which has resulted in the deaths of thousands, it was Mr Zelenskyy's outfit that seemed to set the meeting off on a bad footing. As Mr Trump shook Mr Zelenskyy's hand at the entrance to the West Wing, he said: \"He is all dressed up today.\"  Ukraine latest: Trump mocks 'big shot' Zelenskyy after fiery White House clash \n                  Israel agrees to Gaza ceasefire extension after phase one period expires\n                 \n                  Starmer doubles down on 'unwavering support' to Ukraine ahead of world leaders' summit\n                 \n                  Ukraine latest: PM has call with Trump 'focused on finding a way forward' after 'meaningful and warm' 10 Downing St meeting with Zelenskyy\n                 Then, during the disastrous press conference, Brian Glenn, who is the chief White House correspondent for right-wing website Real America's Voice, asked Mr Zelenskyy why he doesn't wear a suit and accused him of having a lack of respect for America. \"I will wear a costume when this war is finished,\" the Ukrainian leader responded. \"Maybe something like yours. Maybe something better. Maybe something cheaper.\" In Ukrainian, the word \"kostium\" - pronounced \"costume\" - means \"suit\". Mr Glenn - who is dating far-right congresswoman and conspiracy theorist Marjorie Taylor Greene - later issued a statement saying: \"President Zelenskyy has worn the green jumpsuit (or something similar) on every occasion when meeting other world leaders, dressed respectfully for the occasion. \"For him, once again, to enter the highest office in the most powerful nation in the world, dressed as he did, reflects his inner disrespect for not only our country, the president and the US citizens that have made it possible for Ukraine to survive as long as they have to this point. (Financially speaking).\" His girlfriend, Ms Greene also tweeted a video of the interaction, saying she was \"proud\" of him. She added: \"Zelenskyy has so much disrespect for America that he can't even wear a suit in the Oval Office when he comes to beg for money from our President!!\" Earlier, it had appeared as though Mr Zelenskyy's choice of wardrobe was not the issue it later became, with Mr Trump saying at one point, about 20 minutes before the tone of the news conference changed: \"I do like your clothing by the way.\" He added soon afterwards: \"I think he's dressed beautifully.\" Russian state media entered Oval Office The White House selected only certain journalists to be present in the room during the press conference, in line with its new approach to media coverage. Reuters and AP, two of the most established news agencies in the world, were banned from entering, but a Russian state media reporter was allowed inside - albeit briefly. \"TASS was not on the approved list of media for today's pool,\" a White House official said. \"As soon as it came to the attention of press office staff that he was in the Oval, he was escorted out by the Press Secretary. He is not on the approved list for the press conference.\" The White House did not explain how he had been able to gain access unapproved. The administration has clashed with journalists, notable removing AP from the White House pool after it declined to refer to the Gulf of Mexico as the Gulf of America. Mr Zelenskyy, who was elected in 2019, is often seen wearing olive green jumpers, emblazoned with the Ukrainian trident, alongside combat boots. It is a signal to the world that his country is still at war. It reflects his solidarity with the armed forces and those fighting on the frontline. The casual attire serves also serves as a reminder that Ukraine is an active battlefield. While Mr Zelenskyy did wear suits before the war, reflecting his role as head of state, he has stated he will not return to doing so until the war has ended. In December, he wore a similar outfit for the reopening ceremony of Notre Dame cathedral in Paris, as well as for his meeting with then President-elect Trump and French President Emmanuel Macron. Elon Musk and Churchill Many social media users were quick to point out that Elon Musk did not wear a suit during his recent visit to the Oval Office. Images also began circulating of Winston Churchill visiting the White House during the Second World War, dressed in a wartime \"siren suit\". Churchill wore the one-piece air raid outfit during a visit to President Franklin D Roosevelt, in which he hoped to persuade the American public to join the war. Ironically, a bust of Churchill was present in the room during the meeting between Mr Trump and Mr Zelenskyy, which ended in the Ukrainian leader leaving the White House without agreeing to the deal on minerals he had flown 5,000 miles to seal. Mr Zelenskyy has now arrived in the UK for a summit with European leaders on Sunday."

The prime minister welcomed Mr Zelenskyy to Downing Street on Saturday, where they signed a new loan deal for Ukraine following his disastrous meeting with the US president on Friday. On Sunday, the pair will be joined by dozens of world leaders for a summit on Ukraine and security. Ukraine latest: Zelenskyy to meet King Charles Sir Keir will start the day by speaking to Italian PM Giorgia Meloni, before they are joined by French President Emmanuel Macron and leaders from countries including Germany, Denmark, Norway, Poland, Canada, Finland and Romania. Turkey's foreign minister, the EU's Ursula von der Leyen and NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte will also attend.

The pair spoke briefly, before Mr Zelenskyy waved at reporters and gave a thumbs up. They then shook hands as they posed for pictures outside the door of No 10.  As they sat down inside, Sir Keir told Mr Zelenskyy: \"You have full backing across the United Kingdom and we stand with you, with Ukraine, for as long as it may take. \"I hope you heard some of that cheering in the street,\" he continued, saying the cheers signified \"our absolute determination to stand with you - unwavering determination - and to achieve what we both want to achieve, which is a lasting peace.\" Sir Keir added: \"A lasting peace for Ukraine based on sovereignty and security for Ukraine - so important for Ukraine, so important for Europe and so important for the United Kingdom.\" \"So I'm much looking forward to our discussions here this afternoon - thank you very much for making the time to come,\" he said. Mr Zelenskyy replied that he was \"happy to be here\". \"I want to thank you, the people of the United Kingdom and the King,\" he said, noting he will be meeting the monarch tomorrow. \"We count on your support,\" he continued. \"We're really happy we have such partners and such friends.\" A new loan deal for Ukraine Sir Keir and Mr Zelenskyy both posted on X following their meeting, with the British prime minister saying it was an \"honour\" to welcome the Ukrainian leader to No 10. He signed off his post with \"Slava Ukraini\", which means 'Glory to Ukraine'. In a lengthier post, Mr Zelenskyy said the pair \"discussed the challenges facing Ukraine and all of Europe, coordination with partners, concrete steps to strengthen Ukraine's position, and ending the war with a just peace, along with robust security guarantees\". He also announced a new loan agreement signed over a videocall today by chancellor Rachel Reeves and Ukrainian finance minister Sergii Marchenko. The £2.26bn loan will \"enhance Ukraine's defence capabilities\" and \"be repaid using revenues from frozen Russian assets\", Mr Zelenskyy said. The Treasury said: \"The loan demonstrates the UK's commitment to Ukrainian defence. A strong Ukraine is vital to UK national security.\" As well as welcoming Mr Zelenskyy, Sir Keir has spoken to US President Trump and French President Emmanuel Macron today. Sky News understands the calls were constructive and focused on finding a way forward. Two entirely different White House meetings  Both the Ukrainian president and the British prime minister visited the White House this week - but the two meetings had very different outcomes.  Sir Keir won over Mr Trump in the Oval Office on Thursday as he presented the US president with a letter from the King, inviting him to the UK for an historic second state visit. But Mr Zelenskyy's meeting in the same room - just 24 hours later - descended into a fiery shouting match. The Ukrainian president had travelled to Washington DC to attempt to secure a Russia ceasefire agreement and a possible mineral deal with the US.

The Ukrainian president then left early and the rest of the day's engagements, including a news conference, were hastily cancelled. His plane, emblazoned with the Ukrainian flag, touched down at London's Stansted airport and was met by a convoy of cars this morning."

In an interview, he portrayed the meeting as a moment of frank and divergent views between the two but said he did not see the need to apologise. He added he wished that Mr Trump was \"more on our side\" after the US president said he was in the middle of Ukraine and Russia. \"I want, really, him to be more on our side,\" Mr Zelenskyy said. \"It's not just that the war began somewhere between our countries. The war began when Russia brought this war to our country.

He said, however, that his American counterpart needed to understand that Ukraine could not change its attitude on Russia, and would not enter peace talks without security guarantees. \"Everybody (is) afraid Putin will come back tomorrow,\" Mr Zelenskyy said. \"We want just and lasting peace.\" He acknowledged that without US support, his country's position would grow \"difficult.\" After repeatedly declining opportunities to apologise, Mr Zelenskyy closed his Fox appearance by saying: \"We are thankful and sorry for this. I mean this, we wanted very much to have strong relations.\"  'A big shot' Mr Trump said talks with Mr Zelenskyy \"did not work out great from his standpoint\" and mockingly called him a \"big shot\".

        "Content": "By Rachel McGrath, news reporter   It was a meeting to kick off a day of joint engagements – but Donald Trump and Volodymyr Zelenskyy's sit-down saw White House schedules hastily redrawn. The pair met in the Oval Office to discuss a minerals deal - which was supposed to be signed later on - and negotiations over ceasefire agreement with Russia. It started politely enough but around 35 minutes in, the meeting took a quick and unexpected turn. Its demise was fuelled by comments from the man beside the US president: JD Vance. Ukraine latest: Zelenskyy schedules meeting with King Charles  A long-time critic of American support for Ukraine, the vice president berated Mr Zelenskyy for airing disagreements in front of the media - and as he did so, he made a number of claims about topics including the Ukrainian military, official visits to Kyiv and Mr Zelenskyy's political affiliations. Here, we look at the VP's comments and additional context surrounding them. Ukraine is 'forcing conscripts to the frontlines'  Tensions began to rise as Mr Vance called the Ukrainian president \"disrespectful\" - an accusation Mr Trump repeated as the exchange hit its most intense moments. Mr Vance added: \"Right now, you guys are going around and forcing conscripts to the front lines because you have manpower problems. \"You should be thanking the president for trying to bring an end to this conflict.\" His statement that Ukraine is relying on conscription is correct. With some exceptions - such as health issues - Ukrainian men aged 18 to 60 are prohibited from leaving the country and anyone who reaches the age of 25 is conscripted unless they have already volunteered or are exempt.  Conscription is not unusual for armies locked in warfare. It was used by multiple countries during World War One and World War Two, and during the Vietnam War, the US government drafted men to fight via lotteries. Russia is not using conscription to specifically recruit troops for the Ukraine war. But, with a few exceptions, all Russian men aged between 18 and 30 must complete a year of military service - and some of them have been sent to areas such as the Kursk region during the conflict. 'Propaganda tour'  In response to the conscription comment, Mr Zelenskyy asked the VP: \"Have you ever been to Ukraine that you say what problems we have?\" The answer, as Mr Zelenskyy knew, was no. Ignoring the suggestion that he should visit, Mr Vance countered: \"I've actually watched and seen the stories, and I know that what happens is you bring people, you bring them on a propaganda tour, Mr President.\" Since Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, dozens of world leaders have visited the country. Among them are Joe Biden and Sir Keir Starmer, along with then British prime ministers Boris Johnson and Rishi Sunak. The world's media - including Sky News correspondents - have also reported from the frontlines. It's unclear why Mr Vance considers these trips \"propaganda tours\" but it's a term our Moscow correspondent Ivor Bennett has encountered frequently: he says it's a phrase \"one hears on Russian state media on an almost daily basis\". 'Zelenskyy hasn't said thank you'  Another sticking point for Mr Vance was whether Mr Zelenskyy was thankful enough for the US's help. \"Have you said 'thank you' once this entire meeting?\" he asked. \"Offer some words of appreciation for the United States of America and the president who's trying to save your country.\" Mr Zelenskyy insisted he had done so \"a lot of times, even today\" and a glance back at just the past two years proves this to be true. On X, he thanked the US and then president Mr Biden on 21 January 2022, 1 July, 2022, 19 August 2022, 20 November the following year, in March 2024 and as recently as 10 January. He also shared thanks in person when he met Mr Biden in the Oval Office on 21 December 2022, and in speeches in Washington DC on 11 December 2023 and 10 July 2024.  Mr Zelenskyy has thanked Mr Trump since his election win in November last year. On 7 December, he labelled the then president-elect \"resolute\" and said: \"I thank him.\" On 12 February, after a \"meaningful conversation\" with Mr Trump, he wrote: \"I am grateful to President Trump for his interest in what we can accomplish together.\" This is a non-exhaustive list. Read more:Trump and Zelenskyy's body language explainedAnalysis: The row is a triumph for RussiaStarmer in crisis talks with Zelenskyy Zelenskyy 'campaigned' for the Democrats Amid the row over a perceived lack of gratefulness, Mr Vance told Mr Zelenskyy: \"You went to Pennsylvania and campaigned for the opposition in October.\" The Ukrainian president's reply was simply \"no\". Mr Zelenskyy did visit Pennsylvania alongside the state's governor Josh Shapiro, a Democrat, in September last year, but he wasn't on the campaign trail. Under tight security Mr Zelenskyy visited an ammunition factory to thank workers for producing vital munitions for Ukraine's fight against Russia. He wrote on X afterwards: \"It is in places like this where you can truly feel that the democratic world can prevail. \"Thanks to people like these - in Ukraine, in America, and in all partner countries - who work tirelessly to ensure that life is protected.\" On the same trip, he met with Mr Trump in New York."

Following his early exit from the Oval Office, Volodymyr Zelenskyy has left Washington and flown directly to the UK for an urgent meeting with Sir Keir Starmer ahead of Sunday's summit with European leaders. It's an event which has been brought forward by a day, such is the anxiety about the unprecedented public breakdown in the relationship between the US and the Ukrainians. After the verbal beating meted out by Donald Trump and JD Vance, walking into Number 10 for a tete-a-tete with one of his staunchest allies will surely be something of a relief for the Ukrainian president. But the question is what they can do to try and salvage the situation. Ukraine latest: Zelenskyy meets UK PM  After replaying the humiliating row in his head all night, Mr Zelenskyy has issued a detailed statement defending his position. Clearly bruised by the vice president's unfounded claims about a lack of gratitude, he repeatedly thanked Mr Trump and the American people for their support. But the fundamentals of his position - and the roots of that row with the Trump administration - remain unchanged. He reiterated his argument that Vladimir Putin has repeatedly broken ceasefires in the past and cannot be trusted not to do so in the future without strong US security guarantees. \"Once these guarantees are in place, we can talk with Russia, Europe and the US about diplomacy,\" he said. \"I want the US to stand more firmly on our side.\" Given his outright hostility to Mr Zelenskyy, it's not a message Mr Trump seems in any mood to hear. But it is effectively the position of the UK government too. Sir Keir has pledged his willingness to put British boots on the ground as part of a European peacekeeping force, in the event of a peace deal - but only if the US agrees to provide a security \"backstop\" to deter Mr Putin from attacking again. Read more:Starmer in crisis talks with ZelenskyyPope not out of danger, Vatican sources sayTrump 'offended' by Zelenskyy's outfit  Sunday's summit - hosted by Sir Keir and bringing together Mr Zelenskyy with a group of key European leaders - was meant to cap off a week of busy diplomacy. The British prime minister and French President Emmanuel Macron had clearly hoped to build on the success of their own visits to the White House and drum up further offers of support for their European peacekeeping plan. Now that diplomatic momentum has been stopped in its tracks. Would the Europeans even consider going it alone, without the Americans? It was previously an unthinkable question, involving inconceivable increases in defence spending. But the continent's leaders have been relatively united in expressing their unshakeable backing for Mr Zelenskyy. Surely they will need to discuss how far they would be prepared to go if Mr Trump followed through with his threats to cancel American support completely. The prime minister only had a few hours to bask in the glow of his own unexpectedly successful trip to the White House on Thursday before Mr Zelenskyy's visit blew up in such an extreme fashion. Now his position as Mr Trump's new best friend (with the \"lovely accent\") will be tested much more quickly than anyone had predicted. Will the prime minister be able to leverage their special relationship to stand up for Mr Zelenskyy and resurrect American support for Ukraine? He's regularly talked about acting as a bridge between Europe and the US. But it's an increasingly impossible task when the two continents are pulling themselves apart."

Volodymyr Zelenskyy had travelled to Washington DC as he was due to clinch a deal on minerals with the US on Friday, but he left empty handed after a heated exchange in the Oval Office. Under the watch of the world's media, the final ten minutes of the meeting descended into a shouting match, as both Mr Trump and his vice president, JD Vance, accused Mr Zelenskyy of being \"ungrateful\". Mr Trump berated Mr Zelenskyy as \"disrespectful\", while the Ukrainian leader tried to defend himself. Kyiv citizens speaking to Sky News have said they stand by their president - despite calls from the US for him to stand down and hold an election.

That is our power.\" When asked about the potential withdrawal of US support, she said: \"I hope Europe will help us.

Stone, 63, known for the 2001 hit Wish I Didn't Miss You, died in a car accident in Montgomery, Alabama, early on Saturday, following a performance, her representative Deborah R Champagne said. Guy Todd Williams, better known as Rahiem from the Grandmaster Flash And The Furious Five, the first rap group inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame, said nine other passengers were in a van with Stone during the accident but she was the only fatality. Music producer Walter Millsap III told The Associated Press in an email: \"Unfortunately, at around 4am while heading back to Atlanta from Alabama, the Sprinter flipped over and was subsequently hit by a big rig. Thankfully, all survived except for Angie.\" Stone, who was nominated for three Grammy Awards, including for best female R&B vocal performance in 2005, was also a songwriter and acted in movies and on Broadway. Born in Columbia, South Carolina, in 1961, Stone honed her singing talents in church. She helped form female hip-hop trio The Sequence, whose most popular song, 1979's Funk You Up, peaked at 15 on Billboard's Hot Soul Singles. \n                  American football player Medrick Burnett Jr dies a month after head-on-head collision in Alabama game\n                 \n                  Death Row prisoner uses final words to swear - before taking 10 minutes to die in nitrogen execution\n                 \n                  Alabama shooting: Teenager killed and 16 people injured in US university attack\n                 The song has been sampled by numerous artists, including Dr Dre. It was the first rap hit performed by women, according to Rolling Stone. The group were signed to the now defunct Sugar Hill Records, which also represented Grandmaster Flash And The Furious Five, among other artists. Williams said Stone \"left her indelible mark on the music industry initially as a member of the legendary rap group Sequence\". Her success in the UK was modest but her 1999 album Black Diamond and 2001 LP Mahogany Soul went Gold and spawned several chart hits. She also had a number of successful collaborations with artists such as Guru, Omar, Macy Gray, Moby, Prince and Blue including on the 2003 top 11 chart hit Signed, Sealed, Delivered, I'm Yours. She created hits such as No More Rain (In This Cloud) which reached number one for 10 weeks on Billboard's Adult R&B airplay chart, Baby with soul singer Betty Wright, another number one hit, as well as Wish I Didn't Miss You and Brotha.

        "Content": "David Johansen, the singer from seminal punk band the New York Dolls, has died at the age of 75. Formed in the early 1970s, the New York Dolls redefined rock and roll, providing the blueprint for British punk bands such as the Sex Pistols and The Clash, and inspiring the glam-metal movement. Johansen died \"peacefully\" at his home in New York City on Friday, his family said. He was \"holding the hands of his wife Mara Hennessey and stepdaughter Leah, in the sunlight surrounded by music and flowers\", they added. Johansen's death comes just weeks after the singer's family said he had stage 4 cancer and a brain tumour. His daughter Leah shared the diagnosis as she launched a crowdfunding campaign to help cover healthcare costs. Sharing news of the singer's death on the page, his family said: \"He was thankful that he had a chance to be in touch with so many friends and family before he passed. \"He knew he was ecstatically loved.\" There will be \"several events celebrating David's life and artistry\" announced in due course, they added. Johansen began his career as a singer with the Vagabond Missionaries in the late 1960s, before being invited to join the New York Dolls in 1971. While the band - whose tracks include Personality Crisis and Looking For A Kiss - were critically acclaimed, they never found commercial success and broke up after two albums by the middle of the decade. Despite their split after just five years, the Dolls' presence in the early punk scene had an undeniable impact on the music world. More from Sky News:BRIT Awards' best red carpet looksOscars 2025 predictions  Shortly after their demise, the band were quoted as a major influence on British bands including The Clash, The Damned and the Sex Pistols - whose deprecating track New York is about the Dolls. Their style - women's clothes, heavy makeup and teased hair - inspired the glam-metal movement that emerged with acts such as Mötley Crüe a decade later. Johansen embarked on a solo career after the band split and released albums under both his own name and the pseudonym Buster Poindexter. In 2004, the band's three surviving members - Johansen, Arthur 'Killer' Kane' and Sylvain Sylvain - reunited and continued performing until 2011. Johansen is survived by his wife, Mara, and stepdaughter, Leah."

Gaza ceasefire explained The holy month of Ramadan started on Friday and is usually between 29 and 30 days. Pictures emerged from Gaza of Palestinians celebrating among the rubble. The Jewish holiday of Passover is shorter, but this year finishes on Sunday 20 April. The announcement came just after the first phase of the previously agreed ceasefire expired on Saturday. Phase one halted 15 months of fighting and saw the release of 33 Israeli hostages held in Gaza and five Thai nationals, in exchange for around 2,000 Palestinian prisoners and detainees. \n                  Government calls 'urgent meeting' with BBC over controversial Gaza documentary\n                 \n                  Trump shares AI video of Gaza vision featuring golden statues, bearded belly dancers and Netanyahu on a sunbed\n                 \n                  Operation Iron Wall: West Bank areas 'turning into mini-Gaza' as Israeli troops bulldoze homes\n                 The extension would push back phase two of the ceasefire, which was intended to introduce talks to bring about a permanent end to the war. Hamas said earlier on Saturday the group rejected Israel's \"formulation\" of extending the first phase of the ceasefire in Gaza, but did not explicitly mention Mr Witkoff's plan. It isn't clear what Hamas's response to this plan is yet. Both sides have previously traded accusations that the other violated the fragile ceasefire. Meanwhile, talks on the long-term future of Gaza are yet to seriously materialise after the UN said it would take decades to rebuild the enclave. Israeli statement A statement from the prime minister's office originally published in Hebrew said that on the first day of the proposed extension, half of the hostages and bodies of the dead would be released. It added that at the end, if an agreement on a permanent ceasefire was reached, the remaining hostages and bodies would also be released. The statement added: \"Witkoff proposed the outline for extending the ceasefire after he was impressed that at this stage there was no possibility of bridging the positions of the parties to end the war, and that additional time was needed for talks on a permanent ceasefire.\" It went on to add that Israel could return to fighting \"after the 42nd day if it feels that the negotiations are ineffective\", pointing out that this was supported by the Trump administration. It isn't clear what dates these days correspond to. Contention over the extension Two Palestinian officials familiar with the negotiations told Reuters that Israel refused to enter phase two of the agreement or start negotiations about it. Instead, they said that Israel requested an extension of the first phase, conditioned on the handover of a number of hostages and bodies for each week of the extension. Hamas however, Reuters reported, rejected this and insisted on sticking to the original agreement and entering into the second phase, as was previously agreed.

It added that they rejected Israel's proposal to extend the ceasefire for four weeks, with hostage releases, without officially entering the second phase."

        "Content": "By Rachel McGrath, news reporter   It was a meeting to kick off a day of joint engagements – but Donald Trump and Volodymyr Zelenskyy's sit-down saw White House schedules hastily redrawn. The pair met in the Oval Office to discuss a minerals deal - which was supposed to be signed later on - and negotiations over ceasefire agreement with Russia. It started politely enough but around 35 minutes in, the meeting took a quick and unexpected turn. Its demise was fuelled by comments from the man beside the US president: JD Vance. Ukraine latest: Zelenskyy schedules meeting with King Charles  A long-time critic of American support for Ukraine, the vice president berated Mr Zelenskyy for airing disagreements in front of the media - and as he did so, he made a number of claims about topics including the Ukrainian military, official visits to Kyiv and Mr Zelenskyy's political affiliations. Here, we look at the VP's comments and additional context surrounding them. Ukraine is 'forcing conscripts to the frontlines'  Tensions began to rise as Mr Vance called the Ukrainian president \"disrespectful\" - an accusation Mr Trump repeated as the exchange hit its most intense moments. Mr Vance added: \"Right now, you guys are going around and forcing conscripts to the front lines because you have manpower problems. \"You should be thanking the president for trying to bring an end to this conflict.\" His statement that Ukraine is relying on conscription is correct. With some exceptions - such as health issues - Ukrainian men aged 18 to 60 are prohibited from leaving the country and anyone who reaches the age of 25 is conscripted unless they have already volunteered or are exempt.  Conscription is not unusual for armies locked in warfare. It was used by multiple countries during World War One and World War Two, and during the Vietnam War, the US government drafted men to fight via lotteries. Russia is not using conscription to specifically recruit troops for the Ukraine war. But, with a few exceptions, all Russian men aged between 18 and 30 must complete a year of military service - and some of them have been sent to areas such as the Kursk region during the conflict. 'Propaganda tour'  In response to the conscription comment, Mr Zelenskyy asked the VP: \"Have you ever been to Ukraine that you say what problems we have?\" The answer, as Mr Zelenskyy knew, was no. Ignoring the suggestion that he should visit, Mr Vance countered: \"I've actually watched and seen the stories, and I know that what happens is you bring people, you bring them on a propaganda tour, Mr President.\" Since Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, dozens of world leaders have visited the country. Among them are Joe Biden and Sir Keir Starmer, along with then British prime ministers Boris Johnson and Rishi Sunak. The world's media - including Sky News correspondents - have also reported from the frontlines. It's unclear why Mr Vance considers these trips \"propaganda tours\" but it's a term our Moscow correspondent Ivor Bennett has encountered frequently: he says it's a phrase \"one hears on Russian state media on an almost daily basis\". 'Zelenskyy hasn't said thank you'  Another sticking point for Mr Vance was whether Mr Zelenskyy was thankful enough for the US's help. \"Have you said 'thank you' once this entire meeting?\" he asked. \"Offer some words of appreciation for the United States of America and the president who's trying to save your country.\" Mr Zelenskyy insisted he had done so \"a lot of times, even today\" and a glance back at just the past two years proves this to be true. On X, he thanked the US and then president Mr Biden on 21 January 2022, 1 July, 2022, 19 August 2022, 20 November the following year, in March 2024 and as recently as 10 January. He also shared thanks in person when he met Mr Biden in the Oval Office on 21 December 2022, and in speeches in Washington DC on 11 December 2023 and 10 July 2024.  Mr Zelenskyy has thanked Mr Trump since his election win in November last year. On 7 December, he labelled the then president-elect \"resolute\" and said: \"I thank him.\" On 12 February, after a \"meaningful conversation\" with Mr Trump, he wrote: \"I am grateful to President Trump for his interest in what we can accomplish together.\" This is a non-exhaustive list.

Mr Zelenskyy did visit Pennsylvania alongside the state's governor Josh Shapiro, a Democrat, in September last year, but he wasn't on the campaign trail. Under tight security Mr Zelenskyy visited an ammunition factory to thank workers for producing vital munitions for Ukraine's fight against Russia. He wrote on X afterwards: \"It is in places like this where you can truly feel that the democratic world can prevail. \"Thanks to people like these - in Ukraine, in America, and in all partner countries - who work tirelessly to ensure that life is protected.\" On the same trip, he met with Mr Trump in New York."

        "Content": " Volodymyr Zelenskyy was advised to wear a suit to the White House and Donald Trump was offended when he didn't, according to reports. Ahead of the historic meeting, the Ukrainian president was advised by Trump's team to ditch his usual military-style clothing for something more formal, Axios reports. However, he didn't, instead opting to wear all black. This irritated Mr Trump ahead of what quickly became a car crash of a meeting, according to two sources who spoke to Axios. Amid the ongoing conflict in Ukraine, which has resulted in the deaths of thousands, it was Mr Zelenskyy's outfit that seemed to set the meeting off on a bad footing. As Mr Trump shook Mr Zelenskyy's hand at the entrance to the West Wing, he said: \"He is all dressed up today.\"  Ukraine latest: Trump mocks 'big shot' Zelenskyy after fiery White House clash \n                  Israel agrees to Gaza ceasefire extension after phase one period expires\n                 \n                  Starmer doubles down on 'unwavering support' to Ukraine ahead of world leaders' summit\n                 \n                  Ukraine latest: PM has call with Trump 'focused on finding a way forward' after 'meaningful and warm' 10 Downing St meeting with Zelenskyy\n                 Then, during the disastrous press conference, Brian Glenn, who is the chief White House correspondent for right-wing website Real America's Voice, asked Mr Zelenskyy why he doesn't wear a suit and accused him of having a lack of respect for America. \"I will wear a costume when this war is finished,\" the Ukrainian leader responded. \"Maybe something like yours. Maybe something better. Maybe something cheaper.\" In Ukrainian, the word \"kostium\" - pronounced \"costume\" - means \"suit\". Mr Glenn - who is dating far-right congresswoman and conspiracy theorist Marjorie Taylor Greene - later issued a statement saying: \"President Zelenskyy has worn the green jumpsuit (or something similar) on every occasion when meeting other world leaders, dressed respectfully for the occasion. \"For him, once again, to enter the highest office in the most powerful nation in the world, dressed as he did, reflects his inner disrespect for not only our country, the president and the US citizens that have made it possible for Ukraine to survive as long as they have to this point. (Financially speaking).\" His girlfriend, Ms Greene also tweeted a video of the interaction, saying she was \"proud\" of him. She added: \"Zelenskyy has so much disrespect for America that he can't even wear a suit in the Oval Office when he comes to beg for money from our President!!\" Earlier, it had appeared as though Mr Zelenskyy's choice of wardrobe was not the issue it later became, with Mr Trump saying at one point, about 20 minutes before the tone of the news conference changed: \"I do like your clothing by the way.\" He added soon afterwards: \"I think he's dressed beautifully.\" Russian state media entered Oval Office The White House selected only certain journalists to be present in the room during the press conference, in line with its new approach to media coverage. Reuters and AP, two of the most established news agencies in the world, were banned from entering, but a Russian state media reporter was allowed inside - albeit briefly. \"TASS was not on the approved list of media for today's pool,\" a White House official said. \"As soon as it came to the attention of press office staff that he was in the Oval, he was escorted out by the Press Secretary. He is not on the approved list for the press conference.\" The White House did not explain how he had been able to gain access unapproved. The administration has clashed with journalists, notable removing AP from the White House pool after it declined to refer to the Gulf of Mexico as the Gulf of America. Mr Zelenskyy, who was elected in 2019, is often seen wearing olive green jumpers, emblazoned with the Ukrainian trident, alongside combat boots. It is a signal to the world that his country is still at war. It reflects his solidarity with the armed forces and those fighting on the frontline. The casual attire serves also serves as a reminder that Ukraine is an active battlefield. While Mr Zelenskyy did wear suits before the war, reflecting his role as head of state, he has stated he will not return to doing so until the war has ended. In December, he wore a similar outfit for the reopening ceremony of Notre Dame cathedral in Paris, as well as for his meeting with then President-elect Trump and French President Emmanuel Macron. Elon Musk and Churchill Many social media users were quick to point out that Elon Musk did not wear a suit during his recent visit to the Oval Office. Images also began circulating of Winston Churchill visiting the White House during the Second World War, dressed in a wartime \"siren suit\". Churchill wore the one-piece air raid outfit during a visit to President Franklin D Roosevelt, in which he hoped to persuade the American public to join the war. Ironically, a bust of Churchill was present in the room during the meeting between Mr Trump and Mr Zelenskyy, which ended in the Ukrainian leader leaving the White House without agreeing to the deal on minerals he had flown 5,000 miles to seal. Mr Zelenskyy has now arrived in the UK for a summit with European leaders on Sunday."

        "Content": " The Ukrainian president has refused to apologise for the fiery Oval Office spat with Donald Trump that saw him leave the White House early. Volodymyr Zelenskyy travelled to Washington DC as he was due to clinch a deal on minerals with the US on Friday. But the final ten minutes of a meeting in front of the world's media saw tensions rise and a shouting match unfold. Mr Trump and Mr Zelenskyy had been due to have lunch with their delegations in the White House's cabinet room after the meeting - but untouched salad plates and other items were seen being packed up as the meal was hastily called off and Mr Zelenskyy left the White House. Ukraine latest: Trump's 'big shot' put-down Mr Trump later said that he had \"determined that President Zelenskyy is not ready for peace if America is involved, because he feels our involvement gives him a big advantage in negotiations\". In a later interview with Fox News, Mr Zelenskyy admitted his public spat with the president and Vice President JD Vance was \"not good for both sides\". \n                  Trump and Zelenskyy's body language during White House row analysed\n                 \n                  Zelenskyy says he is 'truly thankful' to US after Trump row - as he arrives in UK for summit\n                 \n                  Trump-Zelenskyy row is triumph for Russia - and makes UK summit of European leaders all the more critical\n                 He was asked by the interviewer whether he owed an apology to Mr Trump and Mr Vance, bit sidestepped the question. \"I'm very thankful for all your support.. I was always very thankful to your people,\" Mr Zelenskyy said. When pressed, he said: \"I'm not sure that we did something bad\". The interview was supposed to be a victory lap on MAGA's favourite TV channel, but the interview turned into disaster management for Mr Zelenskyy. In an interview, he portrayed the meeting as a moment of frank and divergent views between the two but said he did not see the need to apologise. He added he wished that Mr Trump was \"more on our side\" after the US president said he was in the middle of Ukraine and Russia. \"I want, really, him to be more on our side,\" Mr Zelenskyy said. \"It's not just that the war began somewhere between our countries. The war began when Russia brought this war to our country. And they're not right.\" Ukraine's future 'difficult' without US support Mr Zelenskyy also expressed a belief that the relationship could be salvaged. He said, however, that his American counterpart needed to understand that Ukraine could not change its attitude on Russia, and would not enter peace talks without security guarantees. \"Everybody (is) afraid Putin will come back tomorrow,\" Mr Zelenskyy said. \"We want just and lasting peace.\" He acknowledged that without US support, his country's position would grow \"difficult.\" After repeatedly declining opportunities to apologise, Mr Zelenskyy closed his Fox appearance by saying: \"We are thankful and sorry for this. I mean this, we wanted very much to have strong relations.\"  'A big shot' Mr Trump said talks with Mr Zelenskyy \"did not work out great from his standpoint\" and mockingly called him a \"big shot\". The US leader also said the US was not looking for a \"10-year war\". \"He wants to come back right now,\" Trump said, adding \"I can't do that\".

        "Content": "\n          City editor\n              @MarkKleinmanSky\n A former chief executive of Aston Villa and Liverpool is a surprise contender to become the inaugural chairman of the government’s controversial football watchdog. Sky News can exclusively reveal that Christian Purslow, who left Villa Park in 2023, is on a three-person shortlist being considered by Whitehall officials to chair the Independent Football Regulator (IFR). Mr Purslow, an outspoken character who has spent much of his career in sports finance, was this weekend said to be a serious candidate for the job despite having publicly warned about the regulator's proposed remit and its potential impact on the Premier League. A former commercial chief at Chelsea Football Club, Mr Purslow spent an eventful 16 months in charge at Anfield, spearheading the sale of Liverpool to its current owners following a bitter fight with former principals Tom Hicks and George Gillett. He joined Aston Villa in 2018 when the club was in its third consecutive season in the Championship, seeing them promoted via the play-offs at the end of that campaign. It was unclear this weekend how much of the football pyramid would respond to the appointment of a chairman at the regulator who has been so closely associated with top-flight clubs, given ongoing disagreement between the Premier League and English Football League (EFL) about the future distribution of finances. One ally of Mr Purslow said, though, that his independence was not in doubt and that his experience of working outside the Premier League would also be valuable if he landed the IFR chairman role. \n                  The worst supermarkets for online grocery shopping substitutions revealed\n                 \n                  Money blog: 'The more ridiculous the better' - inside the world of extreme day-tripping\n                 \n                  Banks 'investing heavily' in digital platforms as payday glitch chaos strikes again \n                 Another senior football figure said Mr Purslow \"would be welcomed by the football community as someone who has worked in football, and not as a civil servant or politician\". In the past, Mr Purslow has both welcomed the prospect of further regulatory oversight of the sport, while also warning in a BBC interview in 2021, during his stint at Villa Park: \"The Premier League has really always been the source of funding for the rest of football and the danger here is killing the golden goose, if we over-regulate a highly successful and commercial operation. \"I think we have to be very careful as we contemplate reform that it does not ultimately damage the game. \"We already have a hugely successful English football Premier League - the most successful in the world.\" Two years later, however, he told Sky News' political editor, Beth Rigby: \"I like the idea that the government wants to be involved in our national sport. \"These [clubs] are hugely important institutions in their communities, economically and socially - so it's right that they [the government] are interested.\" The disclosure of Mr Purslow's candidacy means that two of the three shortlisted contenders for what will rank among the most powerful jobs in English football have now been identified by Sky News. On Friday, it emerged that Sanjay Bhandari, the chairman of Kick It Out, the football anti-racism charity, was also in the frame for the Manchester-based position, which will pay £130,000-a-year. A decision is expected in the coming weeks, with the third candidate expected to be a woman given the shift in Whitehall to gender-diverse shortlists for public appointments. The establishment of the regulator, which was originally conceived by the previous Conservative government in the wake of the furore over the failed European Super League project, has triggered deep unrest in the sport. This week, Steve Parish, the influential chairman of Premier League side Crystal Palace, told a sports industry conference organised by the Financial Times that the watchdog \"wants to interfere in all of the things we don't need them to interfere in and help with none of the things we actually need help with\". \"We have a problem that we're constantly being told that we're not a business and [that] we're part of the fabric of communities,\" he is reported to have said. \"At the same time, we're…being treated to the nth degree like a business.\" Interviews for the chair of the football regulator took place in November, with a previous recruitment process curtailed by the calling of last year's general election. Lisa Nandy, the culture secretary, will sign off on the appointment of a preferred candidate, with the chosen individual expected to face a pre-appointment hearing in front of the Commons culture, media and sport select committee. The Football Governance Bill is proceeding through parliament, with its next stage expected in March. It forms part of a process that represents the most fundamental shake-up in the oversight of English football in the game's history. The establishment of the body comes with the top tier of the professional game wracked by civil war, with Abu Dhabi-owned Manchester City at the centre of a number of legal cases over its financial dealings. The government has dropped a previous stipulation that the regulator should have regard to British foreign and trade policy when determining the appropriateness of a new club owner. The IFR will monitor clubs' adherence to rules requiring them to listen to fans' views on issues including ticket pricing, while it may also have oversight of the parachute payments made to clubs in the years after their relegation from the Premier League. The top flight has issued a statement expressing reservations about the regulator's remit, while the IFR has been broadly welcomed by the English Football League. A Department for Culture, Media and Sport spokesman said: \"We do not comment on speculation. \"No appointment has been made and the recruitment process for [IFR] chair is ongoing.\" Mr Purslow was abroad this weekend and did not respond to a request for comment."

The retailer getting two out of five stars for its choice of substitutions. Customers said they received received bananas instead of pizza, a roasting tin instead of roast potatoes, while one said they had been given a type of facial cleanser, micellar water, in place of drinking water. A third of Sainsbury's customers (32%) said they received a substitution, but the supermarket was given three out of five stars - suggesting shoppers were generally happier with what was sent out. But among the most bizarre examples reported to Which? were beef dog treats instead of beef steaks, and leeks instead of flowers. Three in ten Morrison's customers had received a replacement item, but it too only managed two stars for the choice of these. In appropriate examples included sanitary towels instead of sandwich wraps and fish steaks in place of lemon cupcakes.

And while some customers saw the funny side, those with dietary restrictions were less than impressed.

The prime minister welcomed Mr Zelenskyy to Downing Street on Saturday, where they signed a new loan deal for Ukraine following his disastrous meeting with the US president on Friday. On Sunday, the pair will be joined by dozens of world leaders for a summit on Ukraine and security. Ukraine latest: Zelenskyy to meet King Charles Sir Keir will start the day by speaking to Italian PM Giorgia Meloni, before they are joined by French President Emmanuel Macron and leaders from countries including Germany, Denmark, Norway, Poland, Canada, Finland and Romania. Turkey's foreign minister, the EU's Ursula von der Leyen and NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte will also attend.

The pair spoke briefly, before Mr Zelenskyy waved at reporters and gave a thumbs up. They then shook hands as they posed for pictures outside the door of No 10.  As they sat down inside, Sir Keir told Mr Zelenskyy: \"You have full backing across the United Kingdom and we stand with you, with Ukraine, for as long as it may take. \"I hope you heard some of that cheering in the street,\" he continued, saying the cheers signified \"our absolute determination to stand with you - unwavering determination - and to achieve what we both want to achieve, which is a lasting peace.\" Sir Keir added: \"A lasting peace for Ukraine based on sovereignty and security for Ukraine - so important for Ukraine, so important for Europe and so important for the United Kingdom.\" \"So I'm much looking forward to our discussions here this afternoon - thank you very much for making the time to come,\" he said. Mr Zelenskyy replied that he was \"happy to be here\". \"I want to thank you, the people of the United Kingdom and the King,\" he said, noting he will be meeting the monarch tomorrow. \"We count on your support,\" he continued. \"We're really happy we have such partners and such friends.\" A new loan deal for Ukraine Sir Keir and Mr Zelenskyy both posted on X following their meeting, with the British prime minister saying it was an \"honour\" to welcome the Ukrainian leader to No 10. He signed off his post with \"Slava Ukraini\", which means 'Glory to Ukraine'. In a lengthier post, Mr Zelenskyy said the pair \"discussed the challenges facing Ukraine and all of Europe, coordination with partners, concrete steps to strengthen Ukraine's position, and ending the war with a just peace, along with robust security guarantees\". He also announced a new loan agreement signed over a videocall today by chancellor Rachel Reeves and Ukrainian finance minister Sergii Marchenko. The £2.26bn loan will \"enhance Ukraine's defence capabilities\" and \"be repaid using revenues from frozen Russian assets\", Mr Zelenskyy said. The Treasury said: \"The loan demonstrates the UK's commitment to Ukrainian defence. A strong Ukraine is vital to UK national security.\" As well as welcoming Mr Zelenskyy, Sir Keir has spoken to US President Trump and French President Emmanuel Macron today. Sky News understands the calls were constructive and focused on finding a way forward. Two entirely different White House meetings  Both the Ukrainian president and the British prime minister visited the White House this week - but the two meetings had very different outcomes.  Sir Keir won over Mr Trump in the Oval Office on Thursday as he presented the US president with a letter from the King, inviting him to the UK for an historic second state visit. But Mr Zelenskyy's meeting in the same room - just 24 hours later - descended into a fiery shouting match. The Ukrainian president had travelled to Washington DC to attempt to secure a Russia ceasefire agreement and a possible mineral deal with the US.

The Ukrainian president then left early and the rest of the day's engagements, including a news conference, were hastily cancelled. His plane, emblazoned with the Ukrainian flag, touched down at London's Stansted airport and was met by a convoy of cars this morning."

It's an event which has been brought forward by a day, such is the anxiety about the unprecedented public breakdown in the relationship between the US and the Ukrainians. After the verbal beating meted out by Donald Trump and JD Vance, walking into Number 10 for a tete-a-tete with one of his staunchest allies will surely be something of a relief for the Ukrainian president. But the question is what they can do to try and salvage the situation. Ukraine latest: Zelenskyy meets UK PM  After replaying the humiliating row in his head all night, Mr Zelenskyy has issued a detailed statement defending his position. Clearly bruised by the vice president's unfounded claims about a lack of gratitude, he repeatedly thanked Mr Trump and the American people for their support. But the fundamentals of his position - and the roots of that row with the Trump administration - remain unchanged. He reiterated his argument that Vladimir Putin has repeatedly broken ceasefires in the past and cannot be trusted not to do so in the future without strong US security guarantees. \"Once these guarantees are in place, we can talk with Russia, Europe and the US about diplomacy,\" he said. \"I want the US to stand more firmly on our side.\" Given his outright hostility to Mr Zelenskyy, it's not a message Mr Trump seems in any mood to hear. But it is effectively the position of the UK government too. Sir Keir has pledged his willingness to put British boots on the ground as part of a European peacekeeping force, in the event of a peace deal - but only if the US agrees to provide a security \"backstop\" to deter Mr Putin from attacking again. Read more:Starmer in crisis talks with ZelenskyyPope not out of danger, Vatican sources sayTrump 'offended' by Zelenskyy's outfit  Sunday's summit - hosted by Sir Keir and bringing together Mr Zelenskyy with a group of key European leaders - was meant to cap off a week of busy diplomacy. The British prime minister and French President Emmanuel Macron had clearly hoped to build on the success of their own visits to the White House and drum up further offers of support for their European peacekeeping plan. Now that diplomatic momentum has been stopped in its tracks. Would the Europeans even consider going it alone, without the Americans? It was previously an unthinkable question, involving inconceivable increases in defence spending. But the continent's leaders have been relatively united in expressing their unshakeable backing for Mr Zelenskyy. Surely they will need to discuss how far they would be prepared to go if Mr Trump followed through with his threats to cancel American support completely. The prime minister only had a few hours to bask in the glow of his own unexpectedly successful trip to the White House on Thursday before Mr Zelenskyy's visit blew up in such an extreme fashion. Now his position as Mr Trump's new best friend (with the \"lovely accent\") will be tested much more quickly than anyone had predicted. Will the prime minister be able to leverage their special relationship to stand up for Mr Zelenskyy and resurrect American support for Ukraine? He's regularly talked about acting as a bridge between Europe and the US. But it's an increasingly impossible task when the two continents are pulling themselves apart."

        "Content": "\n          Arts and entertainment reporter\n              @BethanyMinelle\n Charli XCX has continued her Brat domination at the BRITs, winning five awards, including album of the year. This year's most nominated artist, she took the first prize of the night, best song, telling the crowd: \"I'm really happy that a song about underwear now has a Brit award, very important stuff and I'm sure that that proves something about songwriting but I'm not quite sure what.\" The 32-year-old, whose real name is Charlotte Aitchison, went on to win best dance act and artist of the year, joking that there had been complaints about her sheer top, and adding \"free the nipple\". Taking the top prize of the night, best album, she said: \"I used to tell myself awards weren't important, and that was easy to do as until last year I wasn't nominated for anything. \"I always felt like an outsider, particularly in the British music industry, it feels really nice to get recognition for this album. I've not changed anything… I guess culture caught up with us and wanted to be on this journey.\" She'd already picked up BRIT songwriter of the year award earlier this week. Her success follows a Brat Summer, which saw her sixth album - featuring \"slime green\" artwork - go viral, influencing the US presidential campaign of Kamala Harris and making it into the Collins Dictionary as word of the year. \n                  Brit Awards moments: Sabrina Carpenter rules Britannia, and a tribute to Liam Payne\n                 \n                  BRIT Awards 2025 fashion: The best of the red carpet looks\n                 \n                  BRIT Awards 2025 fashion: The best of the red carpet looks\n                 Charli won three Grammys for the album earlier this month. Read more:Brit Awards momentsThe best of the BRITs red carpet fashionWhat is Brat?How has pop music changed over the years? The biggest night in British music, the ceremony at London's O2 arena was hosted by comedian Jack Whitehall, who was back for the fifth time. There were live performances by artists including Sabrina Carpenter, who opened proceedings, Myles Smith and Sam Fender. Former Little Mix star JADE took her first solo award for best pop act, presented by girl band Sugababes. She thanked her fans for their support, her parents for \"for making me feel like it was a realistic goal to be a pop star ever since I was a little girl,\" and her former bandmates who she said changed her life. British singer-songwriter Myles Smith - whose single Stargazing became one of the UK's biggest hits of 2024 - had previously been named as this year's rising star. His award was presented to him on the night by last year's winners The Last Dinner Party. The singer-songwriter - who said he was from what has been called \"the worst town in Luton,\" raised by a single mother - asked the government why they treated the British music industry \"as an afterthought\". He also asked big music venues what they were doing to help keep grassroots venues alive, as well as highlighting the importance of music managers supporting stars beyond their first hit. British jazz quintet Ezra Collective took group of the year, paying tribute to the \"great youth clubs, great schools, and great teachers\" inspiring young people to take up music. Alaos announced ahead of the ceremony, Sabrina Carpenter became the first international artist to receive the global success award after breaking records in the UK charts. She held the top spot on the Official UK Charts for a combined 21 weeks in 2024, the first artist to do so in 71 years. Her mega-hits Taste, Please Please Please and Espresso also held the top three spots simultaneously, making her the first female artist to do so. A pre-recorded video by music legend Diana Ross led into her award, which was given to her by her close friend, Stranger Things star Millie Bobby Brown. Accepting her prize, Carpenter spoke about coming to the UK with her mother previously when no one knew who she was, and now coming back and \"getting to headline the O2\". She also spoke about her appreciation of British humour, saying \"your humour is so, so dry,\" and her admiration for the British love of caffeine, mainly via a nice cup of tea. Chappell Roan took song of the year for Good Luck, Babe! as well as international artist of the year. Stormzy thanked Jesus for his win in the hip-hop, grime, rap act category, saying he thought fellow nominee, Central Cee, was rap artist of the year. Apologising for wearing his sunglasses on stage, which he said was because he'd \"mashed up his eye playing padel\" (a sporting mash-up of tennis, squash, and badminton), he read a short Biblical quote as he accepted his prize. Raye took British R&B act. Last year she made BRITs history when she secured six awards, the most by an artist in a single year. Irish post-punk band Fontaines DC took international group of the year for the second time. British indie rock act The Last Dinner Party took best new artist after winning the BAFTA rising star award last year. They called small independent venues the \"lifeblood of the music industry\", adding, \"we wouldn't be here without them\". At the end of the night there was a special tribute to former One Direction star Liam Payne, who died in October following a fall from a hotel balcony at the age of 31.

        "Content": "\n          Culture and entertainment reporter\n              @gemmapeplow\n This was Charli XCX's big night. Best artist, best album, best song, and more. The Brat singer took home five awards in total, including the songwriter of the year prize announced ahead of the ceremony. Elsewhere, last year's record-breaking Brits winner Raye took home the best RnB act prize, and there were also awards for Sam Fender, Fontaines DC and former Little Mix star Jade, who gave a shout-out to her bandmates in her acceptance speech. As usual, there were several memorable moments throughout the ceremony. Starting with the opener... Espresso/ Rule Britannia Sabrina Carpenter understood the assignment. Think Geri Halliwell's Union Jack tea towel dress in 1996, Dua Lipa's tube arrival in 2021. The British stars know we love to see the United Kingdom celebrated, but US star Sabrina Carpenter could have been forgiven for going without the pomp and ceremony. But no. She really did her homework. Wearing a red sparkly military-style blazer dress and walking down an aisle lit up with the Union flag, the star was followed by dancing Beefeaters as she launched into Espresso. A mash-up into Rule Britannia followed, before she moved on to perform a cheeky rendition of Bed Chem. We can only applaud.  The star later went on to collect the global success award - announced by none other than music icon Diana Ross, who livestreamed into the ceremony from a show in New York. Collecting the prize on stage, Carpenter recalled coming to the UK for the first time 10 years ago when she said only about 10 people knew who she was. Next week, she's back at the O2 Arena to headline. The Espresso singer added: \"The Brits have given me this award, and this feels like such an insane honour in a very primarily tea-drinking country... you really understood my dry sense of humour because your sense of humour is so, so dry. So I love y'all more than you even understand.\" Calls to save the grassroots Rising star winner Myles Smith may be a newcomer to the Brit Awards, but he wasn't afraid to use the stage to let his thoughts on the state of the music industry be known. The 26-year-old, who performed his songs Nice To Meet You and Stargazing, told the audience that while he had the \"attention of the nation\" he wanted to ask three questions, with his first to the government. \"If British music is one of the most powerful cultural exports we have, why have you treated it like an afterthought for so many years?\" he said. \"How many more venues need to close? How many more music programmes need to be cut before we realise that we can't just celebrate success, you have to protect the foundations that make it?\" Smith went on to question major venues: \"If artists selling out your arenas and your stadiums started in grassroots venues, what are you doing to keep them alive?\" Finally, \"to the execs in the room, and to the people behind the scenes\", he asked: \"Are we building careers or are we just chasing moments?\" In November last year, plans were announced for a voluntary levy on tickets for concerts at stadiums and arenas to help fund grassroots venues after the closures of high numbers in recent years. Femi Koleoso of Ezra Collective also spoke about the importance of nurturing young artists as the jazz group collected the group of the year award, saying they are where they are now \"because of the great youth clubs, and the great teachers and the great schools that support young people playing music\". Bass player Georgia Davies, of indie group The Last Dinner Party, also spoke about the importance of saving independent music venues. \"We wouldn't be a band, and a lot of the artists here would not be bands either, without the UK's incredible independent venues, and they are the lifeblood of the music industry and they are dying,\" she said, as the band collected the best new artist award. Jack Whitehall's return It's been four years since comedian Jack Whitehall was last at the helm of the Brits. He made his comeback with gags about Stormzy - \"the grime scene's Ronald McDonald\", in light of his controversial collaboration with the fast food chain - and dynamic pricing, following the ticket sale for the Oasis reunion gigs announced last year. Whitehall's jokes also included a skit sending up Kanye West and Bianca Censori's infamous Grammy red carpet appearance last month, when Censori dropped her coat to show an incredibly revealing dress and no underwear. This time round, it was Whitehall's parents, Michael and Hilary, preparing to shock the paps. \"It's nothing you haven't seen before, Jack,\" his mum shouted. Stormzy doesn't agree with fan vote The rapper was named best hip-hop/ grime act, one of the genre awards which are voted for by the public. Wearing sunglasses on stage, he told the audience he had hurt his eye playing padel. The 31-year-old said that while he was grateful to the Brits and those who had voted, he did not \"entirely\" agree with the way the genre prizes are chosen. \"I don't entirely think this award should be fan-voted,\" Stormzy said. \"I don't think any of the awards should be fan-voted, not on a controversial one. I don't know, sometimes I think it doesn't let people have their moments. \"I think Cench (Central Cee) was the rap artist of the year, but these things don't define us as much as they're amazing and we love them. I'm very grateful to the Brits, and I'm grateful to the public.\" Chappell Roan's tribute As well as Charli XCX and Carpenter, it was a big night for US star Chappell Roan, who won the awards for best international artist and best international song, for Good Luck, Babe! The singer could not attend the ceremony but recorded acceptance speeches, and dedicated her artist award to trans artists, drag queens, fashion students, sex workers and the late Sinead O'Connor. \"Thank you to my team and my fans all over the world, but especially to my UK girlies, you have been there since day one, and Chappell Roan was born through experiencing queer joy,\" she said. \"It's so special, I had to write an entire album about it. I dedicate this to trans artists, to drag queens, to fashion students, sex workers and Sinead O'Connor. Because of all those people, they have laid the groundwork for me to be here today.\" 'So many amazing memories of Liam' Whitehall said the Brits had to pay tribute to Liam Payne, who was someone who played such a huge part in the show over the years. The 31-year-old died in October, after falling from a hotel balcony in Argentina. Read more:The best of the Brits red carpet fashionWhat is Brat?How has pop music changed over the years? Paying tribute, Whitehall said Payne had \"achieved so much in the short time that he was on this Earth, and was not only a supremely gifted musician, but an incredibly kind soul who touched the lives of everyone he came into contact with\". He continued: \"We have so many amazing memories of Liam here at the Brits, so tonight we celebrate his legacy.\" A video was then played showing clips of the singer with his family, as well as footage from his time as a contestant on The X Factor and with One Direction. Payne won seven awards with One Direction during the band's time together, and also performed at the event when he launched his solo career."

One of the show's stars, Jason Oppenheim, says he's had \"many, many\" emotional calls from clients. \"I'm 30% therapist right now, 20% attorney, 20% contractor and 30% real estate agent,\" he tells Sky News. He says Los Angeles has issues that need resolving if it wants to continue to attract investment. \"We obviously have a crime problem, we have a homelessness problem, we've obviously taxed to the point where we discourage development, and we obviously have seen significant loss of wealthy people leaving the state. \"If you really want to have a healthy, functioning society that's egalitarian and creates opportunity for everyone, you're going to need a lot of wealthy people in that city paying taxes, so you cannot force them away and that's just a fact.\"  Yet despite the frustration, he's optimistic for the future of the Palisades - another area devastated by the fires. \"I would bet anything that the Palisades will be one of the most desirable areas on the planet to live in five years,\" he says. \"The houses will be stunning, fireproof, beautiful architecture.\" But that seems a long way off now, and in the meantime for those left with nothing the little they can salvage becomes special.  For Adam Jette that's even an iron saucepan. \"To be able to pull anything out of this wreckage and have it, it's so meaningful,\" he says. \"It didn't take our pets and it didn't take our family, it just took stuff, but even just some of that surviving it really, it means something.\" Buried in the ashes following the wildfires is a lesson in what matters to those who keep this industry going - and it's not red carpets or golden statuettes."

        "Content": "Angie Stone, the Grammy-nominated US hip hop pioneer whose group The Sequence was one of the first all-female groups to record a rap song, has died in a car crash. Stone, 63, known for the 2001 hit Wish I Didn't Miss You, died in a car accident in Montgomery, Alabama, early on Saturday, following a performance, her representative Deborah R Champagne said. Guy Todd Williams, better known as Rahiem from the Grandmaster Flash And The Furious Five, the first rap group inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame, said nine other passengers were in a van with Stone during the accident but she was the only fatality. Music producer Walter Millsap III told The Associated Press in an email: \"Unfortunately, at around 4am while heading back to Atlanta from Alabama, the Sprinter flipped over and was subsequently hit by a big rig. Thankfully, all survived except for Angie.\" Stone, who was nominated for three Grammy Awards, including for best female R&B vocal performance in 2005, was also a songwriter and acted in movies and on Broadway. Born in Columbia, South Carolina, in 1961, Stone honed her singing talents in church. She helped form female hip-hop trio The Sequence, whose most popular song, 1979's Funk You Up, peaked at 15 on Billboard's Hot Soul Singles. \n                  American football player Medrick Burnett Jr dies a month after head-on-head collision in Alabama game\n                 \n                  Death Row prisoner uses final words to swear - before taking 10 minutes to die in nitrogen execution\n                 \n                  Alabama shooting: Teenager killed and 16 people injured in US university attack\n                 The song has been sampled by numerous artists, including Dr Dre. It was the first rap hit performed by women, according to Rolling Stone. The group were signed to the now defunct Sugar Hill Records, which also represented Grandmaster Flash And The Furious Five, among other artists. Williams said Stone \"left her indelible mark on the music industry initially as a member of the legendary rap group Sequence\". Her success in the UK was modest but her 1999 album Black Diamond and 2001 LP Mahogany Soul went Gold and spawned several chart hits. She also had a number of successful collaborations with artists such as Guru, Omar, Macy Gray, Moby, Prince and Blue including on the 2003 top 11 chart hit Signed, Sealed, Delivered, I'm Yours. She created hits such as No More Rain (In This Cloud) which reached number one for 10 weeks on Billboard's Adult R&B airplay chart, Baby with soul singer Betty Wright, another number one hit, as well as Wish I Didn't Miss You and Brotha.

        "Content": "David Johansen, the singer from seminal punk band the New York Dolls, has died at the age of 75. Formed in the early 1970s, the New York Dolls redefined rock and roll, providing the blueprint for British punk bands such as the Sex Pistols and The Clash, and inspiring the glam-metal movement. Johansen died \"peacefully\" at his home in New York City on Friday, his family said. He was \"holding the hands of his wife Mara Hennessey and stepdaughter Leah, in the sunlight surrounded by music and flowers\", they added. Johansen's death comes just weeks after the singer's family said he had stage 4 cancer and a brain tumour. His daughter Leah shared the diagnosis as she launched a crowdfunding campaign to help cover healthcare costs. Sharing news of the singer's death on the page, his family said: \"He was thankful that he had a chance to be in touch with so many friends and family before he passed. \"He knew he was ecstatically loved.\" There will be \"several events celebrating David's life and artistry\" announced in due course, they added. Johansen began his career as a singer with the Vagabond Missionaries in the late 1960s, before being invited to join the New York Dolls in 1971. While the band - whose tracks include Personality Crisis and Looking For A Kiss - were critically acclaimed, they never found commercial success and broke up after two albums by the middle of the decade. Despite their split after just five years, the Dolls' presence in the early punk scene had an undeniable impact on the music world.

Their style - women's clothes, heavy makeup and teased hair - inspired the glam-metal movement that emerged with acts such as Mötley Crüe a decade later. Johansen embarked on a solo career after the band split and released albums under both his own name and the pseudonym Buster Poindexter. In 2004, the band's three surviving members - Johansen, Arthur 'Killer' Kane' and Sylvain Sylvain - reunited and continued performing until 2011. Johansen is survived by his wife, Mara, and stepdaughter, Leah."
