        "Content": " Iran's foreign minister has claimed there is \"no agreement\" on a ceasefire with Israel - despite Donald Trump announcing a deal has been reached. But on X, Abbas Araghchi said Tehran \"has no intention\" to continue its response - provided the Israeli regime \"stops its illegal aggression against the Iranian people\". He added: \"The final decision on the cessation of our military operations will be made later.\" Earlier, the US president had declared that a \"complete and total ceasefire\" had been agreed between both countries. He made the announcement on Truth Social - hours after Tehran launched a missile strike on a US army base in Qatar. In a post shared at just after 11pm UK time, Mr Trump said the first stage of the ceasefire would begin six hours later. Follow the latest developments in our live blog \n                  Why won't Starmer call out Trump?\n                 \n                  The four questions Starmer will be asking on Iran\n                 \n                  Regime change: Is Trump about to 'Make Iran Great Again'?\n                 This means both countries could still launch strikes in the meantime - and soon after, Israel announced evacuation orders for two areas in Tehran. A senior Iranian official had told the Reuters news agency that Tehran has agreed to the ceasefire after being persuaded by Qatar - but Mr Araghchi's remarks throw this into doubt. Israeli media reports suggest Benjamin Netanyahu was also on board - provided Iran stops firing missiles towards the country. Mr Trump had written: \"Officially, Iran will start the CEASEFIRE and, upon the 12th Hour, Israel will start the CEASEFIRE and, upon the 24th Hour, an Official END to THE 12 DAY WAR will be saluted by the World. \"On the assumption that everything works as it should, which it will, I would like to congratulate both Countries, Israel and Iran, on having the Stamina, Courage, and Intelligence to end, what should be called, 'THE 12 DAY WAR.' \"This is a War that could have gone on for years, and destroyed the entire Middle East, but it didn't, and never will!\"  In an interview with Sky News' partner network NBC, the president said it was a \"great day\" for the US and the Middle East - and a \"wonderful day\" for the world. \"I'm very happy to have been able to get the job done. A lot of people were dying and it was only going to get worse. It would have brought the whole Middle East down,\" he said. Mr Trump said he thinks the ceasefire is \"unlimited\" and is \"going to go forever\" - adding: \"I don't believe they will ever be shooting at each other again.\" The latest remarks from Iran mean this is now uncertain. Just hours earlier, people in the Qatari capital Doha had stopped and gazed up at the sky as Iranian missiles flew to the American al Udeid base and interceptors fired. Officials said there were no casualties, and the US later confirmed it had been warned about the attack by Iran. Mr Trump was in the Situation Room in the White House as the strikes took place. He later claimed on his social network that the missiles were a \"very weak response\", which the US \"expected\" and \"very effectively countered\". The Iranian attack came after the US dropped \"bunker buster bombs\" on three key nuclear sites in Iran over the weekend.  In a new interview on Fox News, US Vice President JD Vance claimed Iran is no longer able to build nuclear weapons after the American attacks. \"Iran was very close to having a nuclear weapon,\" he said. \"Now Iran is incapable of building a nuclear weapon with the equipment they have because we destroyed it.\""

        "Content": " Volodymyr Zelenskyy has told Sky News that Vladimir Putin could attack a NATO country within five years to test the alliance.  The Ukrainian president made the comments in an interview with chief presenter Mark Austin.  But when asked if Russia could attack within months, Mr Zelenskyy said he did not \"believe [Putin] is ready\". Mr Zelenskyy also said plans for NATO members to increase defence spending to 5% of GDP by 2035 are \"very slow\" - adding: \"We believe that, starting from 2030, Putin can have significantly greater capabilities. \"Today, Ukraine is holding him up, he has no time to drill the army.\" Russia's soldiers are \"all getting annihilated and wiped out at the battlefield\", he warned. \"In any case, [Putin] needs a pause, he needs sanctions to be lifted, he needs a drilled army. \n                  Putin says 'all of Ukraine is ours' and threatens nuclear strike\n                 \n                  Putin says 'Ukraine is ours' and threatens nuclear strike - showing how he feels about Trump\n                 \n                  Donald Trump looked uneasy at G7 summit - his early exit spared him a Ukraine showdown\n                 \"And 10 years is a very long time. He will have a new army ready [by then].\" Chief presenter He's an embattled wartime leader struggling to make himself heard. For Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy the war in Iran could not have come at a worse time. Suddenly the world's attention is on a different conflict and most crucially so is the attention of the most powerful man in the world, Donald Trump. But this is a big 24 hours for Zelenskyy, a meeting with Sir Keir Starmer in Downing Street followed by the NATO summit in The Hague. When I sat down with President Zelenskyy in the last few hours he had two main issues on his mind. Firstly, the proposed spending pledge by NATO countries of 5% of GDP by 2035 - that he said was too slow and warned that Putin would be ready with a new army within five years. He said the Russian leader would likely attack a NATO country within a few years to test Article 5. Then he was on to sanctions, which he told me, were not working. Countries, including the UK, were allowing dual use components used in the production of drones and missiles to still get into Russian hands and must be blocked. He also still insisted there would be no negotiations without a ceasefire. This war is not going well for Ukraine right now. Three-and-a-half years into it, the fighting goes on and Zelenskyy appeared to be a defiant president determined to see it through. The UK and its NATO allies will formally sign off the defence spending plans when the heads of state and government meet in The Hague today and tomorrow. The spending goal is broken down into 3.5% of GDP to be spent on pure defence and 1.5% of GDP on related areas, such as infrastructure and cybersecurity. Defence spending of 5% is the kind of level invested by NATO allies during the Cold War.

        "Headline": "There is growing controversy around AI software that transcribes patient conversations, with GPs warned unauthorised tools could breach data rules.",
        "Content": "By Sam Coates, deputy political editor, and Joe Cook, political producer   Doctors are using AI software that does not meet minimum standards to record and transcribe patient meetings, according to a Sky News investigation. NHS bosses have demanded GPs and hospitals stop using artificial intelligence software that could breach data protection rules and put patients at risk. A warning sent out by NHS England this month came just weeks after the same body wrote to doctors about the benefits of using AI for notetaking - to allow them more time to concentrate on patients - using software known as Ambient Voice Technology, or \"AVT\". Health Secretary Wes Streeting will next week put AI at the heart of the reform plan to save the NHS in the 10-year plan for the health service in England. But there is growing controversy around software that records, transcribes and summarises patient conversations using AI. In April, NHS England wrote to doctors to sell the benefits of AVT and set out minimum national standards. However, in a letter seen by Sky News, NHS bosses wrote to doctors to warn that unapproved software that breached minimum standards could harm patients. \n                  Starmer's artificial intelligence adviser steps down\n                 \n                  Video game actor strike ends in US - but AI described as 'direct threat' to UK industry\n                 \n                  Did ChatGPT get the spending review right? Treasury minister gives his verdict\n                 The 9 June letter, from the national chief clinical information officer of NHS England, said: \"We are now aware of a number of AVT solutions which, despite being non-compliant ... are still being widely used in clinical practice. \"Several AVT suppliers are approaching NHS organisations ... many of these vendors have not complied with basic NHS governance standards. \"Proceeding with non-compliant solutions risks clinical safety, data protection breaches, financial exposure, and fragmentation of broader NHS digital strategy.\" Sky News has previously revealed the danger of AI \"hallucinations\", where the technology makes up answers then lies about them, which could prove dangerous in a healthcare setting.  NHS England sets minimum standards but does not tell NHS trusts and healthcare providers which software providers to use. Sky News can now reveal there is growing pressure on NHS England and similar bodies to be more proactive. Dr David Wrigley, deputy chair of the British Medical Association's GP committee, said: \"Undoubtedly, as a GP myself and my 35,000 colleagues, we've got responsibilities here - but in such a rapidly developing market when we haven't got the technical knowledge to look into this. \"We need that help and support from those who can check that the products are safe, check they're secure, that they're suitable for use in the consulting room, and NHS England should do that and help and support us.\" Dr Wrigley continued: \"We're absolutely in favour of tech and in favour of taking that forward to help NHS patients, help my colleagues in their surgeries. \"But it's got to be done in a safe and secure way because otherwise we could have a free for all - and then data could be lost, it could be leaking out, and that just isn't acceptable. \"So we are not dinosaurs, we're very pro-AI, but it has to be a safe, secure way.\" The spectre of dozens of little-known but ambitious AI companies lobbying hospitals and surgeries to get their listening products installed worries some healthcare professionals. There are huge profits to be made in this technological arms race, but the question being asked is whether hundreds of different NHS organisations can really be expected to sift out the sharks. Matthew Taylor, chief executive of the NHS Confederation, said the letter was \"a really significant moment\". He said it was right for the NHS to experiment, but that it needed to be clearer what technology does and does not work safely. \"My own view is that the government should help in terms of the procurement decisions that trusts make and should advise on which AI systems - as we do with other forms of technology that we use in medicine - which ones are safe,\" Mr Taylor said. \"We'll need [government] to do a bit more to guide the NHS in the best way to use this.\" When pressed whether in the short term that actually makes it sound like it could be quite dangerous, Mr Taylor replied: \"What you've seen with ambient voice technology is that kind of 'let a thousand flowers bloom' approach has got its limits.\"  Earlier this year, the health secretary appeared to suggest unapproved technology was being used - but celebrated it as a sign doctors were enthusiastic for change. Mr Streeting said: \"I've heard anecdotally down the pub, genuinely down the pub, that some clinicians are getting ahead of the game and are already using ambient AI to kind of record notes and things, even where their practice or their trust haven't yet caught up with them. \"Now, lots of issues there - not encouraging it - but it does tell me that contrary to this, 'Oh, people don't want to change, staff are very happy and they are really resistant to change', it's the opposite. People are crying out for this stuff.\" Read more from Sky News:National investigation launched into maternity servicesEvery baby in the UK to receive DNA testing Doctors who use AI that complies with national standards already say there are big benefits. Anil Mehta, a doctor in the health secretary's Ilford constituency, told Sky News he backed his MP's drive for more AI technology in healthcare. \"I spend 30% of my week doing paperwork,\" he said. \"So I think once I've explained all of those features of what we're doing, patients are extremely reassured. And I haven't faced anybody that's not wanted to have me do this. He added: \"(I) think that consultation with your doctor is extremely confidential, so that's not changed at all. \"That remains confidential - so whether it's a vulnerable adult, a vulnerable child, teenager, young child with a parent, I think the concept of that confidentiality remains.\" An NHS spokesperson said: \"Ambient Voice Technology has the potential to transform care and improve efficiency and in April, the NHS issued guidance to support its use in a safe and secure way. \"We are working with NHS organisations and suppliers to ensure that all Ambient Voice Technology products used across the health service continue to be compliant with NHS standards on clinical safety and data security.\""

        "Content": "\n          Security and Defence Editor\n              @haynesdeborah\n Sir Keir Starmer said the UK is set to increase spending on defence, security and resilience to 5% of GDP by 2035 to meet an \"era of radical uncertainty\" - but without promising any additional cash. The move - part of a new spending pledge by the NATO alliance - was panned as deceptive \"smoke and mirrors\" by critics, who pointed to the very real risk of escalating conflict between Iran, the US and Israel, as well as Russia's full-scale war in Ukraine. Volodymyr Zelenskyy told Sky News the timeline for the increase was \"very slow\" and warned Russia could attack a NATO country within five years. \"In my view, this is slow because we believe that starting from 2030, Putin can have significantly greater capabilities,\" he told chief presenter Mark Austin.  The prime minister, Donald Trump and the other leaders of NATO's 32 member states are expected to approve the investment goal when they meet at a summit in The Hague, which opens later today. It replaces a previous target to spend 2% of GDP purely on defence. The announcement will be celebrated as a win for the US president, who has been demanding his allies spend more on their own defences instead of relying on American firepower. \n                  Americans are wearing biggest smiles in NATO defence spending battle\n                 \n                  The UK and NATO expected to agree to a Trump-inspired pledge for 5% on defence spending - but watch out for smoke and mirrors \n                 \n                  Inside a NATO base in Poland - as residents bordering Russia say 'scare tactic' is needed\n                 Overnight, he claimed to have secured another success, declaring that Iran and Israel have agreed to a ceasefire - just hours after Iran launched missiles against two American military bases in retaliation to a US decision to attack three Iranian nuclear sites over the weekend. Perhaps it will mean he will switch attention back to achieving a goal to end Russia's war in Ukraine, which will be another key focus of the gathering in the Dutch capital. NATO planners have crunched the summit down to a short main session tomorrow, with a final communique much briefer than usual - all steps designed to reduce the chance of the US president leaving early. He is already scheduled to arrive late and last this evening, provided he turns up. There is huge nervousness about Mr Trump's commitment to an alliance that has been the bedrock of European security since it was founded more than 75 years ago. He is not a fan though, and has previously accused Europe and Canada of an overreliance on American firepower for their own security, calling for them to do more to defend themselves. This pressure has arguably been a bigger motivator in prompting certain allies to agree to spend more on their militaries than the threat they say is posed by Russia, Iran, China and North Korea. Spain's position could create friction this week. The Spanish prime minister, while agreeing to the new investment goal, has said his country is not obliged to meet it. The UK was also slow to say yes - a stance that was at odds with a defence review endorsed by Sir Keir that was centred around a \"NATO-first\" policy. As well as agreeing to the defence and security investment goal, the British government is also publishing a new national security strategy on Tuesday that will highlight the importance of a wider definition of what constitutes security, including energy, food and borders. There will also be a focus on a whole-of-society approach to resilience in an echo of the UK's Cold War past. It described the commitment to invest in defence, security and national resilience as an aligning of \"national security objectives and plans for economic growth in a way not seen since 1945\". Sir Keir said: \"We must navigate this era of radical uncertainty with agility, speed and a clear-eyed sense of the national interest to deliver security for working people and keep them safe. \"That's why I have made the commitment to spend 5% of GDP on national security. This is an opportunity to deepen our commitment to NATO and drive greater investment in the nation's wider security and resilience.\" The funding will be split, with 3.5% of GDP going on core defence and 1.5% on homeland security and national resilience - a new and so far less clearly defined criteria. Progress on investment will be reviewed in 2029. The defence goal is higher than the government's current ambition to lift defence expenditure to 3% of GDP by 2034, from 2.3% currently. The only solid commitment is to spend 2.6% on defence by 2027 - a figure that has been boosted by the addition of the whole of the budget for the intelligence agencies. This level of intelligence spending had not previously been included and has drawn criticism from defence experts because it is not the same as tanks, artillery and troops. Read more:How much damage did US inflict on Iran?UK could send further capabilities to Middle East, minister says The government, in its statement, is now focusing on an even higher-sounding number, claiming that it will hit 4.1% of the new NATO target by 2027. However, this is merely based on adding the new 1.5% spending goal for \"resilience and security\" to the already stated 2.6% defence spending pledge. A Downing Street spokesperson was unable immediately to say how much of GDP is currently spent on whatever is included in the new resilience category. It could include pre-announced investment in civil nuclear energy as well as infrastructure projects such as roads and railways. For the UK, 1.5% of GDP is about £40bn - a significant chunk of national income. Sir Ben Wallace, a former Conservative defence secretary, accused the government of \"spin\" over its spending pledge because it does not include any new money anytime soon. \"The threat to our country is real not spin,\" he told Sky News. \"This government thinks it can use smoke and mirrors to deceive the public and Donald Trump. This is an insult to our troops who will see no significant new money. It fools no one.\""

        "Content": "By Freya Gibson, Kaitlin Tosh and Sophia Massam, data and forensics team   Three of Iran's key nuclear enrichment facilities - Fordow, Natanz and Isfahan - were targeted in US airstrikes on 22 June.  The prime target of the attacks was Iran's most advanced facility at Fordow, suspected of being used to enrich uranium close to what's needed for a nuclear bomb. Satellite images from the aftermath of the US strikes suggest at least six bombs were dropped there. The secure nuclear facility, home to Iran's main enrichment site, is buried deep under a mountain. So exactly how much damage was done is unknown, perhaps even to Iran, which appears to have evacuated the site. The specific location of the strikes and the bombs used gives us an indication. America used the 30,000-lb Massive Ordnance Penetrator bomb, or a GBU-57 - commonly known as a \"bunker buster\". The bunker buster is the only missile that had a chance of destroying the Fordow facility, and American planes were needed for them to be used. \n                  'No agreement' on any ceasefire, Tehran warns - despite Trump's announcement\n                 \n                  Strait of Hormuz: Here's why Iran might close this crucial waterway - and how\n                 \n                  Why won't Starmer call out Trump?\n                 Blueprints from Iran's Nuclear Archive, which date from before 2004 and were seized by Israeli spies in 2018, suggest the bombs targeted the tunnels under the Fordow site. The access tunnels overground lead to a 250 metre long hall which is thought to contain the uranium enrichment centrifuges, and well as the location of what is thought to be ventilation shafts. Iran is thought to have likely moved any enriched uranium from the facility before the strikes occurred. But if the ventilation shafts were hit, that would allow the bombs to penetrate as far as possible and hit the centrifuge hall itself. Science and technology editor The loss of industrial-scale centrifuge \"cascades\" used to enrich uranium will certainly derail any imminent deadlines in weaponisation the Islamic Republic may have set itself - more on that below. But it has already amassed a sizeable stockpile of highly enriched uranium and may even have already enriched some of it to the 90% or so needed to make fissile material necessary for a bomb. And despite strikes on industrial scale facilities that have taken decades to generate that stockpile, the material itself weighs less than half a tonne. Moving it, splitting it up, concealing it, is not beyond the wit of a nation that expected these assaults may be coming. Iran's nuclear programme is also more than its large-scale facilities. Iran has been developing nuclear expertise and industrial processes for decades. It would take more than a concerted bombing campaign to wipe that out. The final steps to \"weaponise\" highly enriched uranium are technically challenging, but Iran was known to be working on them more than 20 years ago. Iran also does not require industrial-scale facilities like those needed to enrich uranium, meaning they could be more easily concealed in a network of smaller, discrete lab-sized buildings. But what's far from clear is whether Iran had actually taken steps towards weaponisation in recent years. Recent US intelligence assessments indicated that it hadn't. Iran's leaders knew that very significant moves towards making a bomb would be seen as a major escalation by its neighbours and the international community. For a long time, a key deterrent to Iran developing a nuclear weapon has been an internal political one. It's possible of course that position may have been shifting and these latest strikes were designed to disarm a rapidly weaponising Iran. But it's also possible the attacks on its nuclear programme may be forcing a previously tentative government to push harder towards making a nuclear bomb. Fordow is only one of three nuclear facilities targeted in America's strike, however, and one of seven that have been targeted since the conflict began. Natanz's uranium enrichment facility, about 140 km south of Fordow, had been subject to multiple Israeli strikes before America's advance. Israeli raids targeted surface buildings, including stores of enriched uranium. However, post-strike radiation monitoring suggested there was little, if any, nuclear material there. At the weekend, Americans dropped bunker-buster bombs there too, targeting thousands of enrichment centrifuges operating in bunkers below. Then there is the Isfahan complex. Again, Israeli missiles destroyed a number of buildings there last week. And at the weekend, US cruise missiles targeted others, including the uranium conversion plant. At the weekend, Americans also dropped bunker-buster bombs there, targeting thousands of enrichment centrifuges operating in bunkers below. Speaking from the White House after the attacks, Donald Trump said facilities had been \"completely and totally obliterated\". But experts suggest it could take more to destroy it entirely. \"This is a very well-developed, long-standing programme with a lot of latent expertise in the country,\" said Darya Dolzikova, a proliferation and nuclear security expert at RUSI, a UK defence and security thinktank \"I don't think we're talking about a full elimination at this point, certainly not by military means.\" The Data and Forensics team is a multi-skilled unit dedicated to providing transparent journalism from Sky News.

        "Content": " Israel's ambassador to the UK has insisted children have \"never\" been targeted in Gaza and said Hamas should be blamed for every death.  Tzipi Hotovely was challenged on the deaths of innocent civilians by Wilfred Frost after two British surgeons, who have worked in Gaza during the Israeli bombardment, filmed video blogs for Sky News. He asked how many children it is \"legitimate and proportionate\" to kill, including those being treated in hospital, in order to kill Hamas terrorists. Follow live Israel-Iran updates: Blast destroys prison gates Ms Hotovely said Israel was \"not there to kill anyone\" and \"never targets civilians\", with its attacks complying with international law.  Dr Victoria Rose, a consultant plastic surgeon, who has worked in Gaza hospitals for three separate periods, previously told Sky she felt the number of children coming through the doors was \"barbaric\". She said there were \"more innocent children, let alone adults, that are dying per Hamas scalp that you see\". Asked about her account, Ms Hotovely said: \"We never targeted the children, it's Hamas that needs to be blamed…But they need to blame Hamas for creating this reality for the Palestinian people.\" She added: \"For every life lost in Gaza, you need to blame Hamas for committing the crimes on 7 October and for committing the war crimes by using people as human shields.\" Hamas-led militants killed some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducted 251 people in the October 7 2023 attack. The group is still holding 50 hostages, with less than half of them believed to be alive. Israel's retaliatory offensive has killed more than 55,000 Palestinians, according to the Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza, which has said women and children make up more than half of the dead. It does not distinguish between civilians and combatants. Ms Hotovely said Israel is \"not interested in wars\", adding: \"So we are asking a very simple request from the international community - pressure Hamas to release our hostages and we will have a better condition to get to a ceasefire.\""

        "Content": "By Sam Coates, deputy political editor, and Joe Cook, political producer   Doctors are using AI software that does not meet minimum standards to record and transcribe patient meetings, according to a Sky News investigation. NHS bosses have demanded GPs and hospitals stop using artificial intelligence software that could breach data protection rules and put patients at risk. A warning sent out by NHS England this month came just weeks after the same body wrote to doctors about the benefits of using AI for notetaking - to allow them more time to concentrate on patients - using software known as Ambient Voice Technology, or \"AVT\". Health Secretary Wes Streeting will next week put AI at the heart of the reform plan to save the NHS in the 10-year plan for the health service in England. But there is growing controversy around software that records, transcribes and summarises patient conversations using AI. In April, NHS England wrote to doctors to sell the benefits of AVT and set out minimum national standards. However, in a letter seen by Sky News, NHS bosses wrote to doctors to warn that unapproved software that breached minimum standards could harm patients. \n                  Starmer's artificial intelligence adviser steps down\n                 \n                  Video game actor strike ends in US - but AI described as 'direct threat' to UK industry\n                 \n                  Did ChatGPT get the spending review right? Treasury minister gives his verdict\n                 The 9 June letter, from the national chief clinical information officer of NHS England, said: \"We are now aware of a number of AVT solutions which, despite being non-compliant ... are still being widely used in clinical practice. \"Several AVT suppliers are approaching NHS organisations ... many of these vendors have not complied with basic NHS governance standards. \"Proceeding with non-compliant solutions risks clinical safety, data protection breaches, financial exposure, and fragmentation of broader NHS digital strategy.\" Sky News has previously revealed the danger of AI \"hallucinations\", where the technology makes up answers then lies about them, which could prove dangerous in a healthcare setting.  NHS England sets minimum standards but does not tell NHS trusts and healthcare providers which software providers to use. Sky News can now reveal there is growing pressure on NHS England and similar bodies to be more proactive. Dr David Wrigley, deputy chair of the British Medical Association's GP committee, said: \"Undoubtedly, as a GP myself and my 35,000 colleagues, we've got responsibilities here - but in such a rapidly developing market when we haven't got the technical knowledge to look into this. \"We need that help and support from those who can check that the products are safe, check they're secure, that they're suitable for use in the consulting room, and NHS England should do that and help and support us.\" Dr Wrigley continued: \"We're absolutely in favour of tech and in favour of taking that forward to help NHS patients, help my colleagues in their surgeries. \"But it's got to be done in a safe and secure way because otherwise we could have a free for all - and then data could be lost, it could be leaking out, and that just isn't acceptable. \"So we are not dinosaurs, we're very pro-AI, but it has to be a safe, secure way.\" The spectre of dozens of little-known but ambitious AI companies lobbying hospitals and surgeries to get their listening products installed worries some healthcare professionals. There are huge profits to be made in this technological arms race, but the question being asked is whether hundreds of different NHS organisations can really be expected to sift out the sharks. Matthew Taylor, chief executive of the NHS Confederation, said the letter was \"a really significant moment\". He said it was right for the NHS to experiment, but that it needed to be clearer what technology does and does not work safely. \"My own view is that the government should help in terms of the procurement decisions that trusts make and should advise on which AI systems - as we do with other forms of technology that we use in medicine - which ones are safe,\" Mr Taylor said. \"We'll need [government] to do a bit more to guide the NHS in the best way to use this.\" When pressed whether in the short term that actually makes it sound like it could be quite dangerous, Mr Taylor replied: \"What you've seen with ambient voice technology is that kind of 'let a thousand flowers bloom' approach has got its limits.\"  Earlier this year, the health secretary appeared to suggest unapproved technology was being used - but celebrated it as a sign doctors were enthusiastic for change. Mr Streeting said: \"I've heard anecdotally down the pub, genuinely down the pub, that some clinicians are getting ahead of the game and are already using ambient AI to kind of record notes and things, even where their practice or their trust haven't yet caught up with them. \"Now, lots of issues there - not encouraging it - but it does tell me that contrary to this, 'Oh, people don't want to change, staff are very happy and they are really resistant to change', it's the opposite. People are crying out for this stuff.\" Read more from Sky News:National investigation launched into maternity servicesEvery baby in the UK to receive DNA testing Doctors who use AI that complies with national standards already say there are big benefits. Anil Mehta, a doctor in the health secretary's Ilford constituency, told Sky News he backed his MP's drive for more AI technology in healthcare. \"I spend 30% of my week doing paperwork,\" he said. \"So I think once I've explained all of those features of what we're doing, patients are extremely reassured. And I haven't faced anybody that's not wanted to have me do this. He added: \"(I) think that consultation with your doctor is extremely confidential, so that's not changed at all. \"That remains confidential - so whether it's a vulnerable adult, a vulnerable child, teenager, young child with a parent, I think the concept of that confidentiality remains.\" An NHS spokesperson said: \"Ambient Voice Technology has the potential to transform care and improve efficiency and in April, the NHS issued guidance to support its use in a safe and secure way. \"We are working with NHS organisations and suppliers to ensure that all Ambient Voice Technology products used across the health service continue to be compliant with NHS standards on clinical safety and data security.\""

        "Content": "\n          Security and Defence Editor\n              @haynesdeborah\n Sir Keir Starmer said the UK is set to increase spending on defence, security and resilience to 5% of GDP by 2035 to meet an \"era of radical uncertainty\" - but without promising any additional cash. The move - part of a new spending pledge by the NATO alliance - was panned as deceptive \"smoke and mirrors\" by critics, who pointed to the very real risk of escalating conflict between Iran, the US and Israel, as well as Russia's full-scale war in Ukraine. Volodymyr Zelenskyy told Sky News the timeline for the increase was \"very slow\" and warned Russia could attack a NATO country within five years. \"In my view, this is slow because we believe that starting from 2030, Putin can have significantly greater capabilities,\" he told chief presenter Mark Austin.  The prime minister, Donald Trump and the other leaders of NATO's 32 member states are expected to approve the investment goal when they meet at a summit in The Hague, which opens later today. It replaces a previous target to spend 2% of GDP purely on defence. The announcement will be celebrated as a win for the US president, who has been demanding his allies spend more on their own defences instead of relying on American firepower. \n                  Americans are wearing biggest smiles in NATO defence spending battle\n                 \n                  The UK and NATO expected to agree to a Trump-inspired pledge for 5% on defence spending - but watch out for smoke and mirrors \n                 \n                  Inside a NATO base in Poland - as residents bordering Russia say 'scare tactic' is needed\n                 Overnight, he claimed to have secured another success, declaring that Iran and Israel have agreed to a ceasefire - just hours after Iran launched missiles against two American military bases in retaliation to a US decision to attack three Iranian nuclear sites over the weekend. Perhaps it will mean he will switch attention back to achieving a goal to end Russia's war in Ukraine, which will be another key focus of the gathering in the Dutch capital. NATO planners have crunched the summit down to a short main session tomorrow, with a final communique much briefer than usual - all steps designed to reduce the chance of the US president leaving early. He is already scheduled to arrive late and last this evening, provided he turns up. There is huge nervousness about Mr Trump's commitment to an alliance that has been the bedrock of European security since it was founded more than 75 years ago. He is not a fan though, and has previously accused Europe and Canada of an overreliance on American firepower for their own security, calling for them to do more to defend themselves. This pressure has arguably been a bigger motivator in prompting certain allies to agree to spend more on their militaries than the threat they say is posed by Russia, Iran, China and North Korea. Spain's position could create friction this week. The Spanish prime minister, while agreeing to the new investment goal, has said his country is not obliged to meet it. The UK was also slow to say yes - a stance that was at odds with a defence review endorsed by Sir Keir that was centred around a \"NATO-first\" policy. As well as agreeing to the defence and security investment goal, the British government is also publishing a new national security strategy on Tuesday that will highlight the importance of a wider definition of what constitutes security, including energy, food and borders. There will also be a focus on a whole-of-society approach to resilience in an echo of the UK's Cold War past. It described the commitment to invest in defence, security and national resilience as an aligning of \"national security objectives and plans for economic growth in a way not seen since 1945\". Sir Keir said: \"We must navigate this era of radical uncertainty with agility, speed and a clear-eyed sense of the national interest to deliver security for working people and keep them safe. \"That's why I have made the commitment to spend 5% of GDP on national security. This is an opportunity to deepen our commitment to NATO and drive greater investment in the nation's wider security and resilience.\" The funding will be split, with 3.5% of GDP going on core defence and 1.5% on homeland security and national resilience - a new and so far less clearly defined criteria. Progress on investment will be reviewed in 2029. The defence goal is higher than the government's current ambition to lift defence expenditure to 3% of GDP by 2034, from 2.3% currently. The only solid commitment is to spend 2.6% on defence by 2027 - a figure that has been boosted by the addition of the whole of the budget for the intelligence agencies. This level of intelligence spending had not previously been included and has drawn criticism from defence experts because it is not the same as tanks, artillery and troops. Read more:How much damage did US inflict on Iran?UK could send further capabilities to Middle East, minister says The government, in its statement, is now focusing on an even higher-sounding number, claiming that it will hit 4.1% of the new NATO target by 2027. However, this is merely based on adding the new 1.5% spending goal for \"resilience and security\" to the already stated 2.6% defence spending pledge. A Downing Street spokesperson was unable immediately to say how much of GDP is currently spent on whatever is included in the new resilience category. It could include pre-announced investment in civil nuclear energy as well as infrastructure projects such as roads and railways. For the UK, 1.5% of GDP is about £40bn - a significant chunk of national income. Sir Ben Wallace, a former Conservative defence secretary, accused the government of \"spin\" over its spending pledge because it does not include any new money anytime soon. \"The threat to our country is real not spin,\" he told Sky News. \"This government thinks it can use smoke and mirrors to deceive the public and Donald Trump. This is an insult to our troops who will see no significant new money. It fools no one.\""

The action has been taken after the activist group claimed responsibility for breaking into RAF Brize Norton last week.

She said a draft proscription order will be laid in parliament next week and if passed, it will make it illegal to be a member of, or invite support for, Palestine Action. Proscription can lead to prison sentences of up to 14 years for some offences, although some breaches are punishable with fines. Read more: What does proscription mean? Saeed Taji Farouky, a member of the group, told Sky News the proscription was \"completely irrational\" and \"without precedent\".

Armed forces minister Luke Pollard said a \"full review\" of security at military bases was under way, and the government was working alongside counter-terror police to find the activists who broke into the Oxfordshire base.

In her statement, she referred to repeated criminal action \"against businesses and institutions, including key national infrastructure and defence firms\". She added that Palestine Action's activity had \"increased in frequency and severity\" since 2024 and \"become more aggressive, with its members demonstrating a willingness to use violence\". She made reference to an attack against the Thales defence factory in Glasgow in 2022, where she said \"the group caused over a million pounds of damage, including to parts essential to submarines\". In this case, several members were prosecuted. But protesters claim this makes their point. Wearing a Free Palestine T-shirt, protester Robert said: \"If you don't agree with those things, there are laws that can be used - but acts of terrorism have not been committed.\" Another protester, Mia, said: \"It would feel farcical if it wasn't so scary.\" Her banner read: \"Yvette Cooper - if you are anti anti-genocide you are pro-genocide.\" 'Sinister development' No doubt there were many at the protest who simply want an end to the violence in Gaza and feel the government is complicit in its support for Israel. In that sense, it feels like a sinister development for their right to protest to be curtailed. Palestine Action has stated that its mission is to \"break the tools used to commit\" genocide - an allegation Israel denies. The problem is that PA appears to have identified UK defence firms and military hardware, as part of those tools - things that are actually used to defend this country. In the view of the home secretary, this has crossed the line from simply criminal to extremist - and a threat to national security."

        "Content": " A \"rapid\" national investigation into NHS maternity services has been launched by the government. The announcement comes after Health Secretary Wes Streeting met families who have lost babies and amid the ongoing investigations at some NHS trusts into maternity care failings. The investigation in England is intended to provide truth to families suffering harm, as well as driving urgent improvements to care and safety, as part of efforts to ensure \"no parent or baby is ever let down again\". Politics latest: Farage unveils 'Britannia Card' in latest tax policy The Royal College of Midwives (RCM) welcomed the government's announcement and said maternity services were \"at, or even beyond, breaking point\". Last week, the NHS regulator said maternity and neonatal services at two Leeds hospitals had been rated inadequate over safety issues. Mr Streeting, who was speaking at the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists (RCOG) conference in London, apologised on behalf of the NHS for what families had been through and said it was \"clear something is going wrong\". He added: \"For the past year, I have been meeting bereaved families from across the country who have lost babies or suffered serious harm during what should have been the most joyful time in their lives. \"What they have experienced is devastating - deeply painful stories of trauma, loss, and a lack of basic compassion - caused by failures in NHS maternity care that should never have happened. \"Their bravery in speaking out has made it clear: we must act - and we must act now.\" Mr Streeting said families have had to \"fight for truth and justice\" and had described being \"ignored, gaslit, lied to, manipulated and damaged further by the inability for a trust to simply be honest with them that something has gone wrong\". Health correspondent This was a powerful speech from the health secretary who is clearly troubled by the scandalous state of maternity services in this country. Wes Streeting has spent the past year meeting bereaved families who have been failed by the NHS. He said he \"was kept up at night\" after listening to their harrowing testimonies. Announcing a national investigation into NHS maternity services, this review is modelled on the Darzi report into the NHS, commissioned by the health secretary almost as soon as he came into office. It will be \"rapid\". The terms of reference for the investigation will be known by July. The actual report is expected to be published by Christmas. Mr Streeting accepts this is an ambitious timeline but is driven by the fear that mothers and babies are still being failed and he does not want \"any deaths on his watch\". Read the full analysis here. The investigation will consist of two parts. The first will investigate up to 10 of the most concerning maternity and neonatal units, including Sussex, in the coming weeks to give affected families answers as quickly as possible, according to the Department of Health. The second will be a \"system-wide\" look at maternity and neonatal care, uniting lessons from past inquiries to create one clear set of actions designed to improve NHS care. A National Maternity and Neonatal Taskforce will be chaired by Mr Streeting and made up of experts and bereaved families. The investigation will begin this summer and report back by December.  Sir Jim Mackey, chief executive of NHS England, said: \"This rapid national investigation must mark a line in the sand for maternity care - setting out one set of clear actions for NHS leaders to ensure high quality care for all.\" Dr Ranee Thakar, president of the RCOG, said: \"The maternity workforce is on its knees, with many now leaving the profession.\" Read more from Sky News:GPs can start prescribing weight loss jabs on NHSStunning images show new 'peek of cosmos' RCM chief executive Gill Walton said: \"Everyone involved in maternity services - the midwifery community, obstetricians, anaesthetists, sonographers and, of course, the women and families in their care - knows that maternity services are at, or even beyond, breaking point. \"This renewed focus and commitment by the health secretary to deliver change is welcome, and we will do everything we can to support him in doing so.\""

The 67-year-old announced his diagnosis on social media, saying it was one of stage four \"advanced\" cancer.

Sir Chris was himself diagnosed with stage four prostate cancer in September 2023. Advanced prostate cancer is when the cancer cells have spread to other parts of the body, according to Macmillan Cancer Support.

        "Content": "\n          Political correspondent\n              @tamcohen\n Moderate Labour MPs are planning a \"reasoned amendment\" to oppose the government's disability benefit cuts, Sky News understands. Nearly 100 Labour MPs are understood to have given their backing to this measure, which means the government could be defeated on its flagship welfare reforms. MPs who have not yet gone public with their criticisms have signed the motion, calling for a delay to assess the impact of cuts to personal independence payments (PIP). They express concerns, according to a draft seen by Sky News, about the government's own figures showing 250,000 people could be pushed into poverty, and what the forecast is for how many may find employment. The reasoned amendment was tabled by Dame Meg Hillier, chair of the Treasury select committee, with the support of 12 other select committee chairs. Other senior figures, who are normally loyal to the party leadership, are understood to be spearheading the reasoned amendment, which would need to be selected by Commons Speaker Sir Lindsay Hoyle when MPs debate the legislation next week. It is an attempt to force the government to water down the benefit changes, in advance of the vote. It is understood that 99 MPs had signed it by Monday evening. \n                  Volodymyr Zelenskyy meets the King ahead of talks with Sir Keir Starmer\n                 \n                  Why won't Starmer call out Trump?\n                 \n                  'Stability in Middle East is priority,' says Starmer - as world reacts to strikes\n                 The amendment emerged as Work and Pensions Secretary Liz Kendall was addressing the weekly gathering of Labour MPs and peers to sell the reforms to PIP and universal credit. The government argues the welfare bill is rising \"unsustainably\". Opponents of the changes to sickness and disability benefits say opinion among Labour MPs has hardened since the draft legislation was published last week. Dozens of MPs are said to have expressed concerns to party bosses, including junior ministers and aides. A party whip resigned her post last week to oppose the reforms.  Some MPs, who have not yet spoken publicly, told Sky News the chances of the government losing the vote were \"under-priced\". It is understood that No 10 officials have told concerned MPs they would be \"voting with Nigel Farage\" and \"will bring us all down\" if they vote against the changes. On Monday night, Ms Kendall told a meeting of Labour MPs that they must back the changes, saying the survival of the welfare state depended on it. Some current PIP claimants are set to lose their benefits when they are reassessed from the end of next year. Ms Kendall said: \"There is no route to social justice based on greater benefit spending alone. \"The path to fairer society - one where everyone thrives, where people who can work get the support they need, and where we protect those who cannot - that is the path we seek to build with our reforms. \"Our plans are rooted in fairness - for those who need support and for taxpayers. \"They are about ensuring the welfare state survives, so there is always a safety net for those who need it.\"  The first vote on the legislation is next week, and a defeat would be a major blow to Sir Keir Starmer's plans to cut the welfare bill, which the government say is becoming \"unsustainable\". Ms Kendall has been reassuring MPs that nine out of 10 PIP claimants will keep their benefits, and those who are most vulnerable will be protected."

        "Content": "\n          Political correspondent\n              @robpowellnews\n  Former minister Tulip Siddiq has accused the leader of Bangladesh of conducting an \"orchestrated campaign\" to damage her reputation and \"interfere with UK politics\", according to a new legal letter seen by Sky News.  The Labour MP also said comments made by Professor Muhammad Yunus in a Sky News interview have prejudiced her right to a fair investigation, meaning the ongoing corruption inquiries into her should be dropped. In March, the chief adviser - who is effectively the country's interim leader - told Sky News that Ms Siddiq \"has so many (sic) wealth left behind here\" and \"should be made responsible\".  Bangladesh's Anti-Corruption Commission (ACC) has opened several investigations into Ms Siddiq alleging corruption in connection with the government of her aunt Sheikh Hasina, who was ousted as the country's prime minister last year. In the new correspondence sent today to Professor Yunus and the ACC, lawyers for the former minister write: \"The time has now come for the chief adviser and the ACC to abandon their wholly misconceived and unlawful campaign to smear Ms Siddiq's reputation and interfere with her public service.\" Responding to the legal letter seen by Sky News, the press secretary to Professor Yunus said: \"The chief advisor and the Anti-Corruption Commission ( ACC) of Bangladesh has no reason and scope to interfere in UK Politics. \"The Anti-Corruption Commission relies not on hearsay but on documentary evidence and witness testimony.\" The press secretary added: \"We hope both the British legal system and the British press appreciate that any pending criminal charge will be resolved in the courts under the provisions of laws of the land. \"Since the courts have summoned Ms. Siddiq and warrants have also been issued, it is her responsibility to defend her position in court. \"If she needs any legal support and is unable to obtain it herself, Bangladesh will provide it. If Ms. Siddiq wilfully ignores the court summons, proceedings against her may proceed in absentia.\" Sky News has approached the ACC for comment.  Speaking to Sky News on Monday, Ms Siddiq said: \"I will not be allowing them to drag me into their world of dirty politics and nothing is going to stop me from pursuing the job that I was elected to do with an overwhelming majority, which is representing the people of Hampstead and Highgate. \"So they need to stop this political vendetta, this smear campaign, and this malicious persecution right from the beginning.\" The MP had requested a meeting with the Bangladeshi leader during an official visit to the UK earlier this month to \"clear up\" any misunderstandings. But this was turned down by the chief adviser, who said he did not want to \"interrupt a legal procedure\".  In the new legal letter, lawyers for Ms Siddiq say the interim leader had already unfairly influenced the inquiries through previous comments. \"The copious briefings to the media, the failure to respond to our letters, the failure to even ask to meet with and question Ms Siddiq during their recent visit to the United Kingdom are impossible to justify and completely inconsistent with a fair, lawful and serious investigation,\" reads the letter. The correspondence also sets a deadline of 30 June 2025 for the Bangladeshi authorities to reply by, stating that \"in the absence of a full and proper response… Ms Siddiq will consider this matter closed\". A former Nobel Prize winning economist, Professor Muhammad Yunus became interim leader of Bangladesh last August after weeks of deadly protests forced Sheikh Hasina from power. He has pledged to root out corruption and recover alleged stolen wealth before holding votes to elect a permanent administration.  Last month, Professor Yunus banned the Awami League - the political party still led by Sheikh Hasina - from standing in the coming elections. That led to criticism from those still loyal to the former prime minister, with protests also sparking in the country over jobs, pay and planned reforms.  Earlier this year, Ms Siddiq attracted criticism over newspaper reports alleging property links to individuals connected to the Awami League. She referred herself to the prime minister's standards adviser Sir Laurie Magnus who said he had \"not identified evidence of improprieties\" but added it was \"regrettable\" Ms Siddiq had not been more alert to the \"potential reputational risks\" of the ties to her aunt. Ms Siddiq said continuing in her role would be \"a distraction\" for the government but insisted she had done nothing wrong. Sheikh Hasina is currently standing trial in absentia in Dhaka over alleged killings during last summer's civil unrest. Asked by Sky News if she had any regrets about links to the Awami league, Ms Siddiq said: \"The main thing I would say to you, I'm very proud to be the MP for Hampstead and Highgate. I was born in London, I grew up in London. I went to school here and now I'm an MP here.\" Read more from Sky News:UK and NATO allies boost defence spendingDoes politics have a place at festivals? In March, Sky News revealed that UK investigators could assist with probes into alleged grand corruption during Hasina's time in power. Staff from the National Crime Agency visited Bangladesh in October and November as part of initial work to support the interim government in the country. Last month, the NCA confirmed it had secured a \"freezing order\" against a property in north London linked to Ms Siddiq's family. She denies all the allegations - and sources close to the MP say the authorities have been sending correspondence to an address in Dhaka that has no connection with her."

        "Content": " Volodymyr Zelenskyy has told Sky News that Vladimir Putin could attack a NATO country within five years to test the alliance.  The Ukrainian president made the comments in an interview with chief presenter Mark Austin.  But when asked if Russia could attack within months, Mr Zelenskyy said he did not \"believe [Putin] is ready\". Mr Zelenskyy also said plans for NATO members to increase defence spending to 5% of GDP by 2035 are \"very slow\" - adding: \"We believe that, starting from 2030, Putin can have significantly greater capabilities. \"Today, Ukraine is holding him up, he has no time to drill the army.\" Russia's soldiers are \"all getting annihilated and wiped out at the battlefield\", he warned. \"In any case, [Putin] needs a pause, he needs sanctions to be lifted, he needs a drilled army. \n                  Putin says 'all of Ukraine is ours' and threatens nuclear strike\n                 \n                  Putin says 'Ukraine is ours' and threatens nuclear strike - showing how he feels about Trump\n                 \n                  Donald Trump looked uneasy at G7 summit - his early exit spared him a Ukraine showdown\n                 \"And 10 years is a very long time. He will have a new army ready [by then].\" Chief presenter He's an embattled wartime leader struggling to make himself heard. For Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy the war in Iran could not have come at a worse time. Suddenly the world's attention is on a different conflict and most crucially so is the attention of the most powerful man in the world, Donald Trump. But this is a big 24 hours for Zelenskyy, a meeting with Sir Keir Starmer in Downing Street followed by the NATO summit in The Hague. When I sat down with President Zelenskyy in the last few hours he had two main issues on his mind. Firstly, the proposed spending pledge by NATO countries of 5% of GDP by 2035 - that he said was too slow and warned that Putin would be ready with a new army within five years. He said the Russian leader would likely attack a NATO country within a few years to test Article 5. Then he was on to sanctions, which he told me, were not working. Countries, including the UK, were allowing dual use components used in the production of drones and missiles to still get into Russian hands and must be blocked. He also still insisted there would be no negotiations without a ceasefire. This war is not going well for Ukraine right now. Three-and-a-half years into it, the fighting goes on and Zelenskyy appeared to be a defiant president determined to see it through. The UK and its NATO allies will formally sign off the defence spending plans when the heads of state and government meet in The Hague today and tomorrow. The spending goal is broken down into 3.5% of GDP to be spent on pure defence and 1.5% of GDP on related areas, such as infrastructure and cybersecurity. Defence spending of 5% is the kind of level invested by NATO allies during the Cold War.

But on X, Abbas Araghchi said Tehran \"has no intention\" to continue its response - provided the Israeli regime \"stops its illegal aggression against the Iranian people\". He added: \"The final decision on the cessation of our military operations will be made later.\" Earlier, the US president had declared that a \"complete and total ceasefire\" had been agreed between both countries. He made the announcement on Truth Social - hours after Tehran launched a missile strike on a US army base in Qatar. In a post shared at just after 11pm UK time, Mr Trump said the first stage of the ceasefire would begin six hours later.

A senior Iranian official had told the Reuters news agency that Tehran has agreed to the ceasefire after being persuaded by Qatar - but Mr Araghchi's remarks throw this into doubt. Israeli media reports suggest Benjamin Netanyahu was also on board - provided Iran stops firing missiles towards the country. Mr Trump had written: \"Officially, Iran will start the CEASEFIRE and, upon the 12th Hour, Israel will start the CEASEFIRE and, upon the 24th Hour, an Official END to THE 12 DAY WAR will be saluted by the World. \"On the assumption that everything works as it should, which it will, I would like to congratulate both Countries, Israel and Iran, on having the Stamina, Courage, and Intelligence to end, what should be called, 'THE 12 DAY WAR.' \"This is a War that could have gone on for years, and destroyed the entire Middle East, but it didn't, and never will!\"  In an interview with Sky News' partner network NBC, the president said it was a \"great day\" for the US and the Middle East - and a \"wonderful day\" for the world. \"I'm very happy to have been able to get the job done. A lot of people were dying and it was only going to get worse. It would have brought the whole Middle East down,\" he said. Mr Trump said he thinks the ceasefire is \"unlimited\" and is \"going to go forever\" - adding: \"I don't believe they will ever be shooting at each other again.\" The latest remarks from Iran mean this is now uncertain. Just hours earlier, people in the Qatari capital Doha had stopped and gazed up at the sky as Iranian missiles flew to the American al Udeid base and interceptors fired. Officials said there were no casualties, and the US later confirmed it had been warned about the attack by Iran. Mr Trump was in the Situation Room in the White House as the strikes took place. He later claimed on his social network that the missiles were a \"very weak response\", which the US \"expected\" and \"very effectively countered\". The Iranian attack came after the US dropped \"bunker buster bombs\" on three key nuclear sites in Iran over the weekend.  In a new interview on Fox News, US Vice President JD Vance claimed Iran is no longer able to build nuclear weapons after the American attacks. \"Iran was very close to having a nuclear weapon,\" he said. \"Now Iran is incapable of building a nuclear weapon with the equipment they have because we destroyed it.\""

He added: \"Most importantly, they've gotten it all out of their 'system,' and there will, hopefully, be no further HATE. \"I want to thank Iran for giving us early notice, which made it possible for no lives to be lost, and nobody to be injured. \"Perhaps Iran can now proceed to Peace and Harmony in the Region, and I will enthusiastically encourage Israel to do the same.\" Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said in a post on X: \"We have not violated anyone's rights, nor will we ever accept anyone violating ours, and we will not surrender to anyone's violation; this is the logic of the Iranian nation.\" Read more:Israel-Iran conflict poses new cost of living threatWhy Iran might close a crucial waterway The attacks came shortly after Qatar closed its airspace as a precaution amid threats from Iran. Just before the explosions, Iranian president Masoud Pezeshkian wrote on the social platform X: \"We neither initiated the war nor seeking it. But we will not leave invasion to the great Iran without answer.\" Kuwait and Bahrain briefly shut their airspaces after the attack, news agencies in each country reported. Iraq also shut its airspace, while Oman Air suspended some flights in the region. The Abu Dhabi-based Etihad Airways said it is rerouting several flights today and tomorrow due to restrictions in parts of the Middle East."

        "Content": "By Freya Gibson, Kaitlin Tosh and Sophia Massam, data and forensics team   Three of Iran's key nuclear enrichment facilities - Fordow, Natanz and Isfahan - were targeted in US airstrikes on 22 June.  The prime target of the attacks was Iran's most advanced facility at Fordow, suspected of being used to enrich uranium close to what's needed for a nuclear bomb. Satellite images from the aftermath of the US strikes suggest at least six bombs were dropped there. The secure nuclear facility, home to Iran's main enrichment site, is buried deep under a mountain. So exactly how much damage was done is unknown, perhaps even to Iran, which appears to have evacuated the site. The specific location of the strikes and the bombs used gives us an indication. America used the 30,000-lb Massive Ordnance Penetrator bomb, or a GBU-57 - commonly known as a \"bunker buster\". The bunker buster is the only missile that had a chance of destroying the Fordow facility, and American planes were needed for them to be used. \n                  'No agreement' on any ceasefire, Tehran warns - despite Trump's announcement\n                 \n                  Strait of Hormuz: Here's why Iran might close this crucial waterway - and how\n                 \n                  Why won't Starmer call out Trump?\n                 Blueprints from Iran's Nuclear Archive, which date from before 2004 and were seized by Israeli spies in 2018, suggest the bombs targeted the tunnels under the Fordow site. The access tunnels overground lead to a 250 metre long hall which is thought to contain the uranium enrichment centrifuges, and well as the location of what is thought to be ventilation shafts. Iran is thought to have likely moved any enriched uranium from the facility before the strikes occurred. But if the ventilation shafts were hit, that would allow the bombs to penetrate as far as possible and hit the centrifuge hall itself. Science and technology editor The loss of industrial-scale centrifuge \"cascades\" used to enrich uranium will certainly derail any imminent deadlines in weaponisation the Islamic Republic may have set itself - more on that below. But it has already amassed a sizeable stockpile of highly enriched uranium and may even have already enriched some of it to the 90% or so needed to make fissile material necessary for a bomb. And despite strikes on industrial scale facilities that have taken decades to generate that stockpile, the material itself weighs less than half a tonne. Moving it, splitting it up, concealing it, is not beyond the wit of a nation that expected these assaults may be coming. Iran's nuclear programme is also more than its large-scale facilities. Iran has been developing nuclear expertise and industrial processes for decades. It would take more than a concerted bombing campaign to wipe that out. The final steps to \"weaponise\" highly enriched uranium are technically challenging, but Iran was known to be working on them more than 20 years ago. Iran also does not require industrial-scale facilities like those needed to enrich uranium, meaning they could be more easily concealed in a network of smaller, discrete lab-sized buildings. But what's far from clear is whether Iran had actually taken steps towards weaponisation in recent years. Recent US intelligence assessments indicated that it hadn't. Iran's leaders knew that very significant moves towards making a bomb would be seen as a major escalation by its neighbours and the international community. For a long time, a key deterrent to Iran developing a nuclear weapon has been an internal political one. It's possible of course that position may have been shifting and these latest strikes were designed to disarm a rapidly weaponising Iran. But it's also possible the attacks on its nuclear programme may be forcing a previously tentative government to push harder towards making a nuclear bomb. Fordow is only one of three nuclear facilities targeted in America's strike, however, and one of seven that have been targeted since the conflict began. Natanz's uranium enrichment facility, about 140 km south of Fordow, had been subject to multiple Israeli strikes before America's advance. Israeli raids targeted surface buildings, including stores of enriched uranium. However, post-strike radiation monitoring suggested there was little, if any, nuclear material there. At the weekend, Americans dropped bunker-buster bombs there too, targeting thousands of enrichment centrifuges operating in bunkers below. Then there is the Isfahan complex. Again, Israeli missiles destroyed a number of buildings there last week. And at the weekend, US cruise missiles targeted others, including the uranium conversion plant. At the weekend, Americans also dropped bunker-buster bombs there, targeting thousands of enrichment centrifuges operating in bunkers below. Speaking from the White House after the attacks, Donald Trump said facilities had been \"completely and totally obliterated\". But experts suggest it could take more to destroy it entirely. \"This is a very well-developed, long-standing programme with a lot of latent expertise in the country,\" said Darya Dolzikova, a proliferation and nuclear security expert at RUSI, a UK defence and security thinktank \"I don't think we're talking about a full elimination at this point, certainly not by military means.\" The Data and Forensics team is a multi-skilled unit dedicated to providing transparent journalism from Sky News.

The fire started on Sunday in three separate locations near the main town, which is also called Chios. The flames were fanned by strong winds and turned into one large blaze. Local media footage and photos showed firefighters battling towering flames burning through woodland and farmland as night fell. Power cuts have also been reported. Greek authorities sent fresh evacuation notifications for two areas near Chios town on Monday morning. Push alerts have been sent to mobile phones in the area urging people to evacuate a total of 16 villages, settlements and neighbourhoods on the outskirts of the town. \"The situation remains critical as firefighting forces are still dealing with many active fronts, several of which being near hamlets,\" a Greek government spokesman said. The fire department said 190 firefighters were trying to control the fire on Monday, with strong winds hampering their efforts. Some 35 vehicles, five helicopters and two water-dropping planes were also involved in the effort. A specialist fire department arson investigation team has been sent to the eastern Aegean island to look into the causes.

        "Content": " At least 22 people have been killed after a suicide bomber opened fire at a church in Syria - and then detonated an explosive vest. This is the first such incident since Bashar al Assad was toppled in December, and officials claim the attacker was a member of Islamic State. It happened at a Greek Orthodox church in Damascus, with estimates suggesting that 350 worshippers were praying there at the time. Witnesses said the perpetrator had his face covered when he began shooting - and blew himself up as crowds attempted to remove him from the building. A security source told Reuters that two men were involved in the attack, with a priest saying he saw a second gunman at the entrance. Officials say 63 people were injured, and children were among the casualties. Syria's information minister, Hamza Mostafa, condemned the terrorist attack - writing on X: \"This cowardly act goes against the civic values that bring us together. \n                  Islamic State group claims first attack on new Syrian government's forces since fall of Assad regime, says monitor\n                 \n                  Islamic State fighters who return to the UK must face justice, committee says\n                 \n                  ISIS and the Yazidis: The women they tried to erase\n                 \"We will not back down from our commitment to equal citizenship... and we also affirm the state's pledge to exert all its efforts to combat criminal organisations.\" Read more world news:Live updates after US strikes IranPutin threatens nuclear strike on Ukraine Reports suggest that IS has attempted to attack several churches in Syria since Assad fell, but this is the first time they have succeeded.

Tzipi Hotovely was challenged on the deaths of innocent civilians by Wilfred Frost after two British surgeons, who have worked in Gaza during the Israeli bombardment, filmed video blogs for Sky News. He asked how many children it is \"legitimate and proportionate\" to kill, including those being treated in hospital, in order to kill Hamas terrorists. Follow live Israel-Iran updates: Blast destroys prison gates Ms Hotovely said Israel was \"not there to kill anyone\" and \"never targets civilians\", with its attacks complying with international law.  Dr Victoria Rose, a consultant plastic surgeon, who has worked in Gaza hospitals for three separate periods, previously told Sky she felt the number of children coming through the doors was \"barbaric\". She said there were \"more innocent children, let alone adults, that are dying per Hamas scalp that you see\". Asked about her account, Ms Hotovely said: \"We never targeted the children, it's Hamas that needs to be blamed…But they need to blame Hamas for creating this reality for the Palestinian people.\" She added: \"For every life lost in Gaza, you need to blame Hamas for committing the crimes on 7 October and for committing the war crimes by using people as human shields.\" Hamas-led militants killed some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducted 251 people in the October 7 2023 attack. The group is still holding 50 hostages, with less than half of them believed to be alive. Israel's retaliatory offensive has killed more than 55,000 Palestinians, according to the Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza, which has said women and children make up more than half of the dead. It does not distinguish between civilians and combatants. Ms Hotovely said Israel is \"not interested in wars\", adding: \"So we are asking a very simple request from the international community - pressure Hamas to release our hostages and we will have a better condition to get to a ceasefire.\""

The camera at the Vera C Rubin Observatory in Chile is expected to reveal new details from space on an unprecedented scale as it makes further observations during the next decade. Scientists expect it to chart thousands of asteroids not previously identified - and believe it will discover within months whether there is a ninth planet in our solar system. The new images show the light from millions of stars and galaxies in observations which took the world's largest and most powerful camera only 10 hours to complete. One image shows a mosaic of the Trifid and Lagoon nebulae, a star-forming region which is 9,000 light years from Earth. A single light year is the distance light travels in 12 months. In space, it \"zips through at 186,000 miles per second and 5.88 trillion miles per year\", says NASA. Another image shows thousands of galaxies in the Virgo Cluster, in what scientists said offers just a \"peek at the cosmos\". The observatory is jointly funded by the National Science Foundation, an independent agency of the US government. The foundation's chief of staff Brian Stone told CNN the observatory \"will capture more information about our universe than all optical telescopes throughout history combined\". Rubin has been built on a mountain in the Andes, a region in central Chile which is also home to other observatories due to its dry air and dark skies. The telescope's work will \"capture the cosmos in exquisite detail\" as it repeatedly scans the sky for 10 years to \"create an ultra-wide, ultra-high-definition time-lapse record of our universe\".

A senior Iranian official had told the Reuters news agency that Tehran has agreed to the ceasefire after being persuaded by Qatar - but Mr Araghchi's remarks throw this into doubt. Israeli media reports suggest Benjamin Netanyahu was also on board - provided Iran stops firing missiles towards the country. Mr Trump had written: \"Officially, Iran will start the CEASEFIRE and, upon the 12th Hour, Israel will start the CEASEFIRE and, upon the 24th Hour, an Official END to THE 12 DAY WAR will be saluted by the World. \"On the assumption that everything works as it should, which it will, I would like to congratulate both Countries, Israel and Iran, on having the Stamina, Courage, and Intelligence to end, what should be called, 'THE 12 DAY WAR.' \"This is a War that could have gone on for years, and destroyed the entire Middle East, but it didn't, and never will!\"  In an interview with Sky News' partner network NBC, the president said it was a \"great day\" for the US and the Middle East - and a \"wonderful day\" for the world. \"I'm very happy to have been able to get the job done. A lot of people were dying and it was only going to get worse. It would have brought the whole Middle East down,\" he said. Mr Trump said he thinks the ceasefire is \"unlimited\" and is \"going to go forever\" - adding: \"I don't believe they will ever be shooting at each other again.\" The latest remarks from Iran mean this is now uncertain. Just hours earlier, people in the Qatari capital Doha had stopped and gazed up at the sky as Iranian missiles flew to the American al Udeid base and interceptors fired. Officials said there were no casualties, and the US later confirmed it had been warned about the attack by Iran. Mr Trump was in the Situation Room in the White House as the strikes took place. He later claimed on his social network that the missiles were a \"very weak response\", which the US \"expected\" and \"very effectively countered\". The Iranian attack came after the US dropped \"bunker buster bombs\" on three key nuclear sites in Iran over the weekend.  In a new interview on Fox News, US Vice President JD Vance claimed Iran is no longer able to build nuclear weapons after the American attacks. \"Iran was very close to having a nuclear weapon,\" he said. \"Now Iran is incapable of building a nuclear weapon with the equipment they have because we destroyed it.\""

        "Headline": "US President Donald Trump promised the destruction of Iran's nuclear enrichment capacity - Sky News' Data and Forensics team assesses how much America's airstrikes achieved.",
        "Content": "By Freya Gibson, Kaitlin Tosh and Sophia Massam, data and forensics team   Three of Iran's key nuclear enrichment facilities - Fordow, Natanz and Isfahan - were targeted in US airstrikes on 22 June.  The prime target of the attacks was Iran's most advanced facility at Fordow, suspected of being used to enrich uranium close to what's needed for a nuclear bomb. Satellite images from the aftermath of the US strikes suggest at least six bombs were dropped there. The secure nuclear facility, home to Iran's main enrichment site, is buried deep under a mountain. So exactly how much damage was done is unknown, perhaps even to Iran, which appears to have evacuated the site. The specific location of the strikes and the bombs used gives us an indication. America used the 30,000-lb Massive Ordnance Penetrator bomb, or a GBU-57 - commonly known as a \"bunker buster\". The bunker buster is the only missile that had a chance of destroying the Fordow facility, and American planes were needed for them to be used. \n                  'No agreement' on any ceasefire, Tehran warns - despite Trump's announcement\n                 \n                  Strait of Hormuz: Here's why Iran might close this crucial waterway - and how\n                 \n                  Why won't Starmer call out Trump?\n                 Blueprints from Iran's Nuclear Archive, which date from before 2004 and were seized by Israeli spies in 2018, suggest the bombs targeted the tunnels under the Fordow site. The access tunnels overground lead to a 250 metre long hall which is thought to contain the uranium enrichment centrifuges, and well as the location of what is thought to be ventilation shafts. Iran is thought to have likely moved any enriched uranium from the facility before the strikes occurred. But if the ventilation shafts were hit, that would allow the bombs to penetrate as far as possible and hit the centrifuge hall itself. Science and technology editor The loss of industrial-scale centrifuge \"cascades\" used to enrich uranium will certainly derail any imminent deadlines in weaponisation the Islamic Republic may have set itself - more on that below. But it has already amassed a sizeable stockpile of highly enriched uranium and may even have already enriched some of it to the 90% or so needed to make fissile material necessary for a bomb. And despite strikes on industrial scale facilities that have taken decades to generate that stockpile, the material itself weighs less than half a tonne. Moving it, splitting it up, concealing it, is not beyond the wit of a nation that expected these assaults may be coming. Iran's nuclear programme is also more than its large-scale facilities. Iran has been developing nuclear expertise and industrial processes for decades. It would take more than a concerted bombing campaign to wipe that out. The final steps to \"weaponise\" highly enriched uranium are technically challenging, but Iran was known to be working on them more than 20 years ago. Iran also does not require industrial-scale facilities like those needed to enrich uranium, meaning they could be more easily concealed in a network of smaller, discrete lab-sized buildings. But what's far from clear is whether Iran had actually taken steps towards weaponisation in recent years. Recent US intelligence assessments indicated that it hadn't. Iran's leaders knew that very significant moves towards making a bomb would be seen as a major escalation by its neighbours and the international community. For a long time, a key deterrent to Iran developing a nuclear weapon has been an internal political one. It's possible of course that position may have been shifting and these latest strikes were designed to disarm a rapidly weaponising Iran. But it's also possible the attacks on its nuclear programme may be forcing a previously tentative government to push harder towards making a nuclear bomb. Fordow is only one of three nuclear facilities targeted in America's strike, however, and one of seven that have been targeted since the conflict began. Natanz's uranium enrichment facility, about 140 km south of Fordow, had been subject to multiple Israeli strikes before America's advance. Israeli raids targeted surface buildings, including stores of enriched uranium. However, post-strike radiation monitoring suggested there was little, if any, nuclear material there. At the weekend, Americans dropped bunker-buster bombs there too, targeting thousands of enrichment centrifuges operating in bunkers below. Then there is the Isfahan complex. Again, Israeli missiles destroyed a number of buildings there last week. And at the weekend, US cruise missiles targeted others, including the uranium conversion plant. At the weekend, Americans also dropped bunker-buster bombs there, targeting thousands of enrichment centrifuges operating in bunkers below. Speaking from the White House after the attacks, Donald Trump said facilities had been \"completely and totally obliterated\". But experts suggest it could take more to destroy it entirely. \"This is a very well-developed, long-standing programme with a lot of latent expertise in the country,\" said Darya Dolzikova, a proliferation and nuclear security expert at RUSI, a UK defence and security thinktank \"I don't think we're talking about a full elimination at this point, certainly not by military means.\" The Data and Forensics team is a multi-skilled unit dedicated to providing transparent journalism from Sky News.

        "Content": " Plans to cut energy costs for thousands of businesses have been announced as part of the government's long-awaited industrial strategy. The announcement confirms Sky News reporting that the plan proposes making energy prices more competitive. Firms have said high prices have hindered growth and made them less competitive. Business Secretary Jonathan Reynolds told Sky News the issue of high electricity costs was \"one of the biggest things business has asked of the new government\". Commercial energy prices are the highest in the G7 group of industrialised nations - and Mr Reynolds said \"that will fundamentally change with what we're putting forward today\". Money blog: Freebies you can claim from companies on your birthday Under the industrial strategy for 2025 to 2035, the government has said it plans to cut the bills of electricity-intensive manufacturers by up to £40 per megawatt hour - up to 25% - from 2027, which could benefit more than 7,000 businesses. These savings will come by exempting them from certain levies on bills. Roughly 500 of the most energy-intensive companies, such as the steel industry, chemicals and glassmaking industries, will also see their network charges cut. The current 60% discount they get, via the British Industry Supercharger scheme, will increase to 90% from next year. The government also said the energy measures would be funded through reforms to the energy system, without raising household bills or taxes. The scope and eligibility for the scheme will be finalised after a consultation. Mr Reynolds said it will be a threshold test based on the percentage of a company's electricity cost as part of your overall output and will be targeted at the businesses which need it the most. Read more from Sky News:Protests over wedding of one of world's richest menLabour MP accuses Bangladesh's leader of 'smear campaign' The policy is the first industrial strategy of its kind in eight years and comes as part of the government's key priority of growing the economy. Pressure was on to develop such a policy after the US's Inflation Reduction Act boosted investment in renewable energy, and the European Union's Net-Zero Industry Act was designed to boost domestic production. A \"bespoke\" 10-year plan has been created for eight sectors where the UK is said to be strong already and there is potential for growth. The sectors named by the government are advanced manufacturing, clean energy, creative industries, defence, digital and technologies, life sciences, professional and business services, and financial services. The state-owned British Business Bank will expand to spur investment into smaller companies, and provide an extra £1.2bn a year by 2028-29. The government also repeated its ambition to cut regulatory burdens, spend more on research and development and speed up the planning process. Mr Reynolds said: \"It means more jobs, more investment in the UK, in a whole range of sectors that are the right thing for the economy, also right for our national resilience and making sure we've got that important manufacturing sector alongside a thriving services sector.\""

        "Content": "\n          Business and economics correspondent\n              @pkelso\n The government's industrial strategy aims to harness the best of British business, from automotive to video gaming via the City and life sciences, in order to deliver the economic growth on which all else depends.  A year in the planning with a 10-year horizon for delivery, in its final months it was hijacked by a very short-term issue; how to give industries battered by the highest electricity prices in the world a chance of competing now, never mind the 2030s. The answer, as reported by Sky News last week, is a significant cut to bills not just for \"energy intensive users\" such as concrete and chemicals that already enjoy support, but to 7,000 manufacturers for whom energy is a high proportion of costs. Money latest: Why Amazon is 'disappointed' They will receive around 15% off their bills from 2027, at an estimated cost of £500m a year. Exactly who benefits will be decided after consultation but the mechanism for delivering discounts, and how they will be paid for, is already decided, and the answer tells us an awkward truth about the UK's energy market. To make industrial energy prices more competitive, qualifying businesses will be exempt from paying some of the taxes and levies added to bills to incentivise the building of renewable energy sources. \n                  Plans to cut energy costs for thousands of businesses announced\n                 \n                  Money blog: Omaze house winner still waiting for keys months after draw\n                 \n                  Fragrances retailer Bodycare lines up debt funding package\n                 These so-called \"policy-costs\", which make up around 15% of energy bills, have been fundamental to the massive expansion of wind and latterly solar power, supported by successive governments over the last two decades. This race for renewables is intended not just to lower emissions but to deliver more stable and, say Labour, cheaper bills by reducing our exposure to volatile gas prices. The UK has been hugely successful in the first part, and green technologies are one of the eight high-growth sectors favoured in this industrial strategy. Israel-Iran latest: Israeli strikes target 'heart of Tehran' Yet by choosing to discount \"green levies\", the government appears to be acknowledging that taxes intended to bring down bills tomorrow are driving prices up and making the UK uncompetitive today. It also raises the prospect that the heaviest energy users will pay less for the expansion of renewables intended to reduce emissions. Ministers say that, unlike previous industrial discounts, the cost of this one will not be passed on to other business or domestic customers. Instead, they say the funding will come from \"headroom\" created by extending price guarantees offered to renewable suppliers (known as Contracts for Difference) from 10 years to 15, and a \"windfall\" expected from linking UK carbon pricing to the EU system. If that sounds like the work of Treasury officials desperate to keep an unfunded £2bn off the books it may well be, but Business Secretary Jonathan Reynolds told Sky News the scheme is compatible with the country's long-term energy goals. He said: \"You can do both things together, you can have ambition on climate and be competitive. These changes mean no one is going to have a higher bill to pay for this, no one will have to pay higher taxes to pay for this, but how those costs are represented in the system will change over time to make sure we have competitive industries. \"There'll be no higher borrowing, no higher taxes and no higher bills from anyone else. And ultimately if we get the increase in investment and business activity I believe this could bring about... a stronger economy overall.\""

The move - part of a new spending pledge by the NATO alliance - was panned as deceptive \"smoke and mirrors\" by critics, who pointed to the very real risk of escalating conflict between Iran, the US and Israel, as well as Russia's full-scale war in Ukraine. Volodymyr Zelenskyy told Sky News the timeline for the increase was \"very slow\" and warned Russia could attack a NATO country within five years. \"In my view, this is slow because we believe that starting from 2030, Putin can have significantly greater capabilities,\" he told chief presenter Mark Austin.  The prime minister, Donald Trump and the other leaders of NATO's 32 member states are expected to approve the investment goal when they meet at a summit in The Hague, which opens later today. It replaces a previous target to spend 2% of GDP purely on defence. The announcement will be celebrated as a win for the US president, who has been demanding his allies spend more on their own defences instead of relying on American firepower. \n                  Americans are wearing biggest smiles in NATO defence spending battle\n                 \n                  The UK and NATO expected to agree to a Trump-inspired pledge for 5% on defence spending - but watch out for smoke and mirrors \n                 \n                  Inside a NATO base in Poland - as residents bordering Russia say 'scare tactic' is needed\n                 Overnight, he claimed to have secured another success, declaring that Iran and Israel have agreed to a ceasefire - just hours after Iran launched missiles against two American military bases in retaliation to a US decision to attack three Iranian nuclear sites over the weekend. Perhaps it will mean he will switch attention back to achieving a goal to end Russia's war in Ukraine, which will be another key focus of the gathering in the Dutch capital. NATO planners have crunched the summit down to a short main session tomorrow, with a final communique much briefer than usual - all steps designed to reduce the chance of the US president leaving early. He is already scheduled to arrive late and last this evening, provided he turns up. There is huge nervousness about Mr Trump's commitment to an alliance that has been the bedrock of European security since it was founded more than 75 years ago. He is not a fan though, and has previously accused Europe and Canada of an overreliance on American firepower for their own security, calling for them to do more to defend themselves. This pressure has arguably been a bigger motivator in prompting certain allies to agree to spend more on their militaries than the threat they say is posed by Russia, Iran, China and North Korea. Spain's position could create friction this week. The Spanish prime minister, while agreeing to the new investment goal, has said his country is not obliged to meet it. The UK was also slow to say yes - a stance that was at odds with a defence review endorsed by Sir Keir that was centred around a \"NATO-first\" policy. As well as agreeing to the defence and security investment goal, the British government is also publishing a new national security strategy on Tuesday that will highlight the importance of a wider definition of what constitutes security, including energy, food and borders. There will also be a focus on a whole-of-society approach to resilience in an echo of the UK's Cold War past. It described the commitment to invest in defence, security and national resilience as an aligning of \"national security objectives and plans for economic growth in a way not seen since 1945\". Sir Keir said: \"We must navigate this era of radical uncertainty with agility, speed and a clear-eyed sense of the national interest to deliver security for working people and keep them safe. \"That's why I have made the commitment to spend 5% of GDP on national security. This is an opportunity to deepen our commitment to NATO and drive greater investment in the nation's wider security and resilience.\" The funding will be split, with 3.5% of GDP going on core defence and 1.5% on homeland security and national resilience - a new and so far less clearly defined criteria. Progress on investment will be reviewed in 2029. The defence goal is higher than the government's current ambition to lift defence expenditure to 3% of GDP by 2034, from 2.3% currently. The only solid commitment is to spend 2.6% on defence by 2027 - a figure that has been boosted by the addition of the whole of the budget for the intelligence agencies. This level of intelligence spending had not previously been included and has drawn criticism from defence experts because it is not the same as tanks, artillery and troops. Read more:How much damage did US inflict on Iran?UK could send further capabilities to Middle East, minister says The government, in its statement, is now focusing on an even higher-sounding number, claiming that it will hit 4.1% of the new NATO target by 2027. However, this is merely based on adding the new 1.5% spending goal for \"resilience and security\" to the already stated 2.6% defence spending pledge. A Downing Street spokesperson was unable immediately to say how much of GDP is currently spent on whatever is included in the new resilience category. It could include pre-announced investment in civil nuclear energy as well as infrastructure projects such as roads and railways. For the UK, 1.5% of GDP is about £40bn - a significant chunk of national income. Sir Ben Wallace, a former Conservative defence secretary, accused the government of \"spin\" over its spending pledge because it does not include any new money anytime soon. \"The threat to our country is real not spin,\" he told Sky News. \"This government thinks it can use smoke and mirrors to deceive the public and Donald Trump. This is an insult to our troops who will see no significant new money. It fools no one.\""

NHS bosses have demanded GPs and hospitals stop using artificial intelligence software that could breach data protection rules and put patients at risk. A warning sent out by NHS England this month came just weeks after the same body wrote to doctors about the benefits of using AI for notetaking - to allow them more time to concentrate on patients - using software known as Ambient Voice Technology, or \"AVT\". Health Secretary Wes Streeting will next week put AI at the heart of the reform plan to save the NHS in the 10-year plan for the health service in England. But there is growing controversy around software that records, transcribes and summarises patient conversations using AI. In April, NHS England wrote to doctors to sell the benefits of AVT and set out minimum national standards. However, in a letter seen by Sky News, NHS bosses wrote to doctors to warn that unapproved software that breached minimum standards could harm patients. \n                  Starmer's artificial intelligence adviser steps down\n                 \n                  Video game actor strike ends in US - but AI described as 'direct threat' to UK industry\n                 \n                  Did ChatGPT get the spending review right? Treasury minister gives his verdict\n                 The 9 June letter, from the national chief clinical information officer of NHS England, said: \"We are now aware of a number of AVT solutions which, despite being non-compliant ... are still being widely used in clinical practice. \"Several AVT suppliers are approaching NHS organisations ... many of these vendors have not complied with basic NHS governance standards. \"Proceeding with non-compliant solutions risks clinical safety, data protection breaches, financial exposure, and fragmentation of broader NHS digital strategy.\" Sky News has previously revealed the danger of AI \"hallucinations\", where the technology makes up answers then lies about them, which could prove dangerous in a healthcare setting.  NHS England sets minimum standards but does not tell NHS trusts and healthcare providers which software providers to use. Sky News can now reveal there is growing pressure on NHS England and similar bodies to be more proactive. Dr David Wrigley, deputy chair of the British Medical Association's GP committee, said: \"Undoubtedly, as a GP myself and my 35,000 colleagues, we've got responsibilities here - but in such a rapidly developing market when we haven't got the technical knowledge to look into this. \"We need that help and support from those who can check that the products are safe, check they're secure, that they're suitable for use in the consulting room, and NHS England should do that and help and support us.\" Dr Wrigley continued: \"We're absolutely in favour of tech and in favour of taking that forward to help NHS patients, help my colleagues in their surgeries. \"But it's got to be done in a safe and secure way because otherwise we could have a free for all - and then data could be lost, it could be leaking out, and that just isn't acceptable. \"So we are not dinosaurs, we're very pro-AI, but it has to be a safe, secure way.\" The spectre of dozens of little-known but ambitious AI companies lobbying hospitals and surgeries to get their listening products installed worries some healthcare professionals. There are huge profits to be made in this technological arms race, but the question being asked is whether hundreds of different NHS organisations can really be expected to sift out the sharks. Matthew Taylor, chief executive of the NHS Confederation, said the letter was \"a really significant moment\". He said it was right for the NHS to experiment, but that it needed to be clearer what technology does and does not work safely. \"My own view is that the government should help in terms of the procurement decisions that trusts make and should advise on which AI systems - as we do with other forms of technology that we use in medicine - which ones are safe,\" Mr Taylor said. \"We'll need [government] to do a bit more to guide the NHS in the best way to use this.\" When pressed whether in the short term that actually makes it sound like it could be quite dangerous, Mr Taylor replied: \"What you've seen with ambient voice technology is that kind of 'let a thousand flowers bloom' approach has got its limits.\"  Earlier this year, the health secretary appeared to suggest unapproved technology was being used - but celebrated it as a sign doctors were enthusiastic for change. Mr Streeting said: \"I've heard anecdotally down the pub, genuinely down the pub, that some clinicians are getting ahead of the game and are already using ambient AI to kind of record notes and things, even where their practice or their trust haven't yet caught up with them. \"Now, lots of issues there - not encouraging it - but it does tell me that contrary to this, 'Oh, people don't want to change, staff are very happy and they are really resistant to change', it's the opposite. People are crying out for this stuff.\" Read more from Sky News:National investigation launched into maternity servicesEvery baby in the UK to receive DNA testing Doctors who use AI that complies with national standards already say there are big benefits. Anil Mehta, a doctor in the health secretary's Ilford constituency, told Sky News he backed his MP's drive for more AI technology in healthcare. \"I spend 30% of my week doing paperwork,\" he said. \"So I think once I've explained all of those features of what we're doing, patients are extremely reassured. And I haven't faced anybody that's not wanted to have me do this. He added: \"(I) think that consultation with your doctor is extremely confidential, so that's not changed at all. \"That remains confidential - so whether it's a vulnerable adult, a vulnerable child, teenager, young child with a parent, I think the concept of that confidentiality remains.\" An NHS spokesperson said: \"Ambient Voice Technology has the potential to transform care and improve efficiency and in April, the NHS issued guidance to support its use in a safe and secure way. \"We are working with NHS organisations and suppliers to ensure that all Ambient Voice Technology products used across the health service continue to be compliant with NHS standards on clinical safety and data security.\""

        "Content": "\n          Political correspondent\n              @tamcohen\n Moderate Labour MPs are planning a \"reasoned amendment\" to oppose the government's disability benefit cuts, Sky News understands. Nearly 100 Labour MPs are understood to have given their backing to this measure, which means the government could be defeated on its flagship welfare reforms. MPs who have not yet gone public with their criticisms have signed the motion, calling for a delay to assess the impact of cuts to personal independence payments (PIP). They express concerns, according to a draft seen by Sky News, about the government's own figures showing 250,000 people could be pushed into poverty, and what the forecast is for how many may find employment. The reasoned amendment was tabled by Dame Meg Hillier, chair of the Treasury select committee, with the support of 12 other select committee chairs. Other senior figures, who are normally loyal to the party leadership, are understood to be spearheading the reasoned amendment, which would need to be selected by Commons Speaker Sir Lindsay Hoyle when MPs debate the legislation next week. It is an attempt to force the government to water down the benefit changes, in advance of the vote. It is understood that 99 MPs had signed it by Monday evening. \n                  Volodymyr Zelenskyy meets the King ahead of talks with Sir Keir Starmer\n                 \n                  Why won't Starmer call out Trump?\n                 \n                  'Stability in Middle East is priority,' says Starmer - as world reacts to strikes\n                 The amendment emerged as Work and Pensions Secretary Liz Kendall was addressing the weekly gathering of Labour MPs and peers to sell the reforms to PIP and universal credit. The government argues the welfare bill is rising \"unsustainably\". Opponents of the changes to sickness and disability benefits say opinion among Labour MPs has hardened since the draft legislation was published last week. Dozens of MPs are said to have expressed concerns to party bosses, including junior ministers and aides. A party whip resigned her post last week to oppose the reforms.  Some MPs, who have not yet spoken publicly, told Sky News the chances of the government losing the vote were \"under-priced\". It is understood that No 10 officials have told concerned MPs they would be \"voting with Nigel Farage\" and \"will bring us all down\" if they vote against the changes. On Monday night, Ms Kendall told a meeting of Labour MPs that they must back the changes, saying the survival of the welfare state depended on it. Some current PIP claimants are set to lose their benefits when they are reassessed from the end of next year. Ms Kendall said: \"There is no route to social justice based on greater benefit spending alone. \"The path to fairer society - one where everyone thrives, where people who can work get the support they need, and where we protect those who cannot - that is the path we seek to build with our reforms. \"Our plans are rooted in fairness - for those who need support and for taxpayers. \"They are about ensuring the welfare state survives, so there is always a safety net for those who need it.\"  The first vote on the legislation is next week, and a defeat would be a major blow to Sir Keir Starmer's plans to cut the welfare bill, which the government say is becoming \"unsustainable\". Ms Kendall has been reassuring MPs that nine out of 10 PIP claimants will keep their benefits, and those who are most vulnerable will be protected."

        "Content": " A \"rapid\" national investigation into NHS maternity services has been launched by the government. The announcement comes after Health Secretary Wes Streeting met families who have lost babies and amid the ongoing investigations at some NHS trusts into maternity care failings. The investigation in England is intended to provide truth to families suffering harm, as well as driving urgent improvements to care and safety, as part of efforts to ensure \"no parent or baby is ever let down again\". Politics latest: Farage unveils 'Britannia Card' in latest tax policy The Royal College of Midwives (RCM) welcomed the government's announcement and said maternity services were \"at, or even beyond, breaking point\". Last week, the NHS regulator said maternity and neonatal services at two Leeds hospitals had been rated inadequate over safety issues. Mr Streeting, who was speaking at the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists (RCOG) conference in London, apologised on behalf of the NHS for what families had been through and said it was \"clear something is going wrong\". He added: \"For the past year, I have been meeting bereaved families from across the country who have lost babies or suffered serious harm during what should have been the most joyful time in their lives. \"What they have experienced is devastating - deeply painful stories of trauma, loss, and a lack of basic compassion - caused by failures in NHS maternity care that should never have happened. \"Their bravery in speaking out has made it clear: we must act - and we must act now.\" Mr Streeting said families have had to \"fight for truth and justice\" and had described being \"ignored, gaslit, lied to, manipulated and damaged further by the inability for a trust to simply be honest with them that something has gone wrong\". Health correspondent This was a powerful speech from the health secretary who is clearly troubled by the scandalous state of maternity services in this country. Wes Streeting has spent the past year meeting bereaved families who have been failed by the NHS. He said he \"was kept up at night\" after listening to their harrowing testimonies. Announcing a national investigation into NHS maternity services, this review is modelled on the Darzi report into the NHS, commissioned by the health secretary almost as soon as he came into office. It will be \"rapid\". The terms of reference for the investigation will be known by July. The actual report is expected to be published by Christmas. Mr Streeting accepts this is an ambitious timeline but is driven by the fear that mothers and babies are still being failed and he does not want \"any deaths on his watch\". Read the full analysis here. The investigation will consist of two parts. The first will investigate up to 10 of the most concerning maternity and neonatal units, including Sussex, in the coming weeks to give affected families answers as quickly as possible, according to the Department of Health. The second will be a \"system-wide\" look at maternity and neonatal care, uniting lessons from past inquiries to create one clear set of actions designed to improve NHS care. A National Maternity and Neonatal Taskforce will be chaired by Mr Streeting and made up of experts and bereaved families. The investigation will begin this summer and report back by December.  Sir Jim Mackey, chief executive of NHS England, said: \"This rapid national investigation must mark a line in the sand for maternity care - setting out one set of clear actions for NHS leaders to ensure high quality care for all.\" Dr Ranee Thakar, president of the RCOG, said: \"The maternity workforce is on its knees, with many now leaving the profession.\" Read more from Sky News:GPs can start prescribing weight loss jabs on NHSStunning images show new 'peek of cosmos' RCM chief executive Gill Walton said: \"Everyone involved in maternity services - the midwifery community, obstetricians, anaesthetists, sonographers and, of course, the women and families in their care - knows that maternity services are at, or even beyond, breaking point. \"This renewed focus and commitment by the health secretary to deliver change is welcome, and we will do everything we can to support him in doing so.\""

        "Content": "\n          Political correspondent\n              @robpowellnews\n  Former minister Tulip Siddiq has accused the leader of Bangladesh of conducting an \"orchestrated campaign\" to damage her reputation and \"interfere with UK politics\", according to a new legal letter seen by Sky News.  The Labour MP also said comments made by Professor Muhammad Yunus in a Sky News interview have prejudiced her right to a fair investigation, meaning the ongoing corruption inquiries into her should be dropped. In March, the chief adviser - who is effectively the country's interim leader - told Sky News that Ms Siddiq \"has so many (sic) wealth left behind here\" and \"should be made responsible\".  Bangladesh's Anti-Corruption Commission (ACC) has opened several investigations into Ms Siddiq alleging corruption in connection with the government of her aunt Sheikh Hasina, who was ousted as the country's prime minister last year. In the new correspondence sent today to Professor Yunus and the ACC, lawyers for the former minister write: \"The time has now come for the chief adviser and the ACC to abandon their wholly misconceived and unlawful campaign to smear Ms Siddiq's reputation and interfere with her public service.\" Responding to the legal letter seen by Sky News, the press secretary to Professor Yunus said: \"The chief advisor and the Anti-Corruption Commission ( ACC) of Bangladesh has no reason and scope to interfere in UK Politics. \"The Anti-Corruption Commission relies not on hearsay but on documentary evidence and witness testimony.\" The press secretary added: \"We hope both the British legal system and the British press appreciate that any pending criminal charge will be resolved in the courts under the provisions of laws of the land. \"Since the courts have summoned Ms. Siddiq and warrants have also been issued, it is her responsibility to defend her position in court. \"If she needs any legal support and is unable to obtain it herself, Bangladesh will provide it. If Ms. Siddiq wilfully ignores the court summons, proceedings against her may proceed in absentia.\" Sky News has approached the ACC for comment.  Speaking to Sky News on Monday, Ms Siddiq said: \"I will not be allowing them to drag me into their world of dirty politics and nothing is going to stop me from pursuing the job that I was elected to do with an overwhelming majority, which is representing the people of Hampstead and Highgate. \"So they need to stop this political vendetta, this smear campaign, and this malicious persecution right from the beginning.\" The MP had requested a meeting with the Bangladeshi leader during an official visit to the UK earlier this month to \"clear up\" any misunderstandings. But this was turned down by the chief adviser, who said he did not want to \"interrupt a legal procedure\".  In the new legal letter, lawyers for Ms Siddiq say the interim leader had already unfairly influenced the inquiries through previous comments. \"The copious briefings to the media, the failure to respond to our letters, the failure to even ask to meet with and question Ms Siddiq during their recent visit to the United Kingdom are impossible to justify and completely inconsistent with a fair, lawful and serious investigation,\" reads the letter. The correspondence also sets a deadline of 30 June 2025 for the Bangladeshi authorities to reply by, stating that \"in the absence of a full and proper response… Ms Siddiq will consider this matter closed\". A former Nobel Prize winning economist, Professor Muhammad Yunus became interim leader of Bangladesh last August after weeks of deadly protests forced Sheikh Hasina from power. He has pledged to root out corruption and recover alleged stolen wealth before holding votes to elect a permanent administration.  Last month, Professor Yunus banned the Awami League - the political party still led by Sheikh Hasina - from standing in the coming elections. That led to criticism from those still loyal to the former prime minister, with protests also sparking in the country over jobs, pay and planned reforms.  Earlier this year, Ms Siddiq attracted criticism over newspaper reports alleging property links to individuals connected to the Awami League. She referred herself to the prime minister's standards adviser Sir Laurie Magnus who said he had \"not identified evidence of improprieties\" but added it was \"regrettable\" Ms Siddiq had not been more alert to the \"potential reputational risks\" of the ties to her aunt. Ms Siddiq said continuing in her role would be \"a distraction\" for the government but insisted she had done nothing wrong. Sheikh Hasina is currently standing trial in absentia in Dhaka over alleged killings during last summer's civil unrest. Asked by Sky News if she had any regrets about links to the Awami league, Ms Siddiq said: \"The main thing I would say to you, I'm very proud to be the MP for Hampstead and Highgate. I was born in London, I grew up in London. I went to school here and now I'm an MP here.\" Read more from Sky News:UK and NATO allies boost defence spendingDoes politics have a place at festivals? In March, Sky News revealed that UK investigators could assist with probes into alleged grand corruption during Hasina's time in power. Staff from the National Crime Agency visited Bangladesh in October and November as part of initial work to support the interim government in the country. Last month, the NCA confirmed it had secured a \"freezing order\" against a property in north London linked to Ms Siddiq's family. She denies all the allegations - and sources close to the MP say the authorities have been sending correspondence to an address in Dhaka that has no connection with her."

        "Content": "\n          Political correspondent\n              @robpowellnews\n  A beneficiary of grand corruption waged by a repressive regime? Or an innocent bystander caught in political crossfire from a country five thousand miles away? Those are the questions at the core of an extraordinary argument that's been raging for months between the Labour MP Tulip Siddiq and the authorities in Bangladesh. Key to understanding this tangled tale is understanding both the recent history of Bangladesh and how Ms Siddiq's family is woven into it. Politics in the country was turned on its head last August after weeks of deadly protests triggered the ousting of longstanding prime minister Sheikh Hasina and her Awami League regime. From there, a temporary government took charge led by an interim leader - or 'Chief Adviser' - the Nobel Prize-winning economist Professor Muhammad Yunus. He pledged to begin legal proceedings to investigate crimes and human rights abuses allegedly committed under the previous regime and recover wealth that had been reportedly taken out of the country. In March, my colleague Cordelia Lynch reported on torture chambers allegedly run by the ousted government and spoke to the interim leader who was clear about where the blame lay. \n                  PM warns of 'era of radical uncertainty' - and says UK will increase defence spending\n                 \n                  Doctors are using unapproved AI software to record patient meetings, investigation reveals \n                 \n                  Labour MPs table 'reasoned amendment' in attempt to halt welfare bill - with enough backers to defeat government\n                 \"Everybody was involved in it all,\" he said. \"The whole government was involved in it.\" He vowed action against Sheikh Hasina and those close to her. Which is where Ms Siddiq enters the story. As well as being the niece of the former prime minister, she is also the granddaughter of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman - the founding president of modern Bangladesh. Tulip Siddiq's mother Sheikh Rehana has also been intimately involved in Bangladeshi politics and was reportedly by the side of her sister Sheikh Hasina when she fled Dhaka and resigned last August. So these are not tangential or loose links. And they - to an extent - explain why the Bangladeshi authorities are going after the Labour MP so vociferously. In short, they see her as part of an establishment that they believe pilfered and abused Bangladesh for two decades. So is this political guilt by association - in other words, a \"vendetta\" as Tulip Siddiq puts it - or is there substance to any of the allegations? Some of the claims certainly stretch believability and appear very political in nature. For instance, stories about her benefitting from billions of pounds siphoned off from a Russian nuclear deal appear to have emanated from a dubious-looking American website which also used an AI-generated image of Ms Siddiq to accompany their 'reporting'. The claims spread after a political opponent of Sheikh Hasina in Bangladesh filed a court claim off the back of them - allowing mainstream UK news outlets to safely report on the story. Other accusations around the allocation of land are potentially more plausible, but as yet no hard evidence has emerged to back up the claims. Read more:What allegations are Tulip Siddiq facing?'My lawyers are ready for questions' There are some parts of this story that look trickier for Ms Siddiq though. Property documentation does show links between her and associates of the Awami League. The Bangladeshi authorities argue this means the Labour MP may have - even unknowingly - benefitted from wealth corruptly taken out of the country and used to purchase flats and houses in the UK. Ms Siddiq says this has been looked at by the Number 10 ethics adviser and found to be in order. Briefing from sources close to the MP also suggests a defence that these property links were born out of regular family relationships rather than anything more political or financial in nature. But a photo of Ms Siddiq in the Kremlin with her aunt in 2013 as well as the fact that she thanked Awami League supporters after her 2015 election suggests a more political context. That said, disentangling politics and family when you are descended from one-time political royalty and standing as an MP in a city with a large Asian community may be easier said than done. The Number 10 probe did suggest she should have been more mindful of the possible reputational damage done by these connections. So this is a saga shaped more by Bangladeshi politics than British politics. A country getting to grips with its past and preparing for the future, but producing side effects in the process that are reaching these shores."

They ask what will be going through the minds of Sir Keir and those around him - and if there are any answers the government can, and will, give in the coming days. Remember, you can also watch us on YouTube."

        "Content": "By Sam Coates, deputy political editor, and Joe Cook, political producer   Doctors are using AI software that does not meet minimum standards to record and transcribe patient meetings, according to a Sky News investigation. NHS bosses have demanded GPs and hospitals stop using artificial intelligence software that could breach data protection rules and put patients at risk. A warning sent out by NHS England this month came just weeks after the same body wrote to doctors about the benefits of using AI for notetaking - to allow them more time to concentrate on patients - using software known as Ambient Voice Technology, or \"AVT\". Health Secretary Wes Streeting will next week put AI at the heart of the reform plan to save the NHS in the 10-year plan for the health service in England. But there is growing controversy around software that records, transcribes and summarises patient conversations using AI. In April, NHS England wrote to doctors to sell the benefits of AVT and set out minimum national standards. However, in a letter seen by Sky News, NHS bosses wrote to doctors to warn that unapproved software that breached minimum standards could harm patients. \n                  Starmer's artificial intelligence adviser steps down\n                 \n                  Video game actor strike ends in US - but AI described as 'direct threat' to UK industry\n                 \n                  Did ChatGPT get the spending review right? Treasury minister gives his verdict\n                 The 9 June letter, from the national chief clinical information officer of NHS England, said: \"We are now aware of a number of AVT solutions which, despite being non-compliant ... are still being widely used in clinical practice. \"Several AVT suppliers are approaching NHS organisations ... many of these vendors have not complied with basic NHS governance standards. \"Proceeding with non-compliant solutions risks clinical safety, data protection breaches, financial exposure, and fragmentation of broader NHS digital strategy.\" Sky News has previously revealed the danger of AI \"hallucinations\", where the technology makes up answers then lies about them, which could prove dangerous in a healthcare setting.  NHS England sets minimum standards but does not tell NHS trusts and healthcare providers which software providers to use. Sky News can now reveal there is growing pressure on NHS England and similar bodies to be more proactive. Dr David Wrigley, deputy chair of the British Medical Association's GP committee, said: \"Undoubtedly, as a GP myself and my 35,000 colleagues, we've got responsibilities here - but in such a rapidly developing market when we haven't got the technical knowledge to look into this. \"We need that help and support from those who can check that the products are safe, check they're secure, that they're suitable for use in the consulting room, and NHS England should do that and help and support us.\" Dr Wrigley continued: \"We're absolutely in favour of tech and in favour of taking that forward to help NHS patients, help my colleagues in their surgeries. \"But it's got to be done in a safe and secure way because otherwise we could have a free for all - and then data could be lost, it could be leaking out, and that just isn't acceptable. \"So we are not dinosaurs, we're very pro-AI, but it has to be a safe, secure way.\" The spectre of dozens of little-known but ambitious AI companies lobbying hospitals and surgeries to get their listening products installed worries some healthcare professionals. There are huge profits to be made in this technological arms race, but the question being asked is whether hundreds of different NHS organisations can really be expected to sift out the sharks. Matthew Taylor, chief executive of the NHS Confederation, said the letter was \"a really significant moment\". He said it was right for the NHS to experiment, but that it needed to be clearer what technology does and does not work safely. \"My own view is that the government should help in terms of the procurement decisions that trusts make and should advise on which AI systems - as we do with other forms of technology that we use in medicine - which ones are safe,\" Mr Taylor said. \"We'll need [government] to do a bit more to guide the NHS in the best way to use this.\" When pressed whether in the short term that actually makes it sound like it could be quite dangerous, Mr Taylor replied: \"What you've seen with ambient voice technology is that kind of 'let a thousand flowers bloom' approach has got its limits.\"  Earlier this year, the health secretary appeared to suggest unapproved technology was being used - but celebrated it as a sign doctors were enthusiastic for change. Mr Streeting said: \"I've heard anecdotally down the pub, genuinely down the pub, that some clinicians are getting ahead of the game and are already using ambient AI to kind of record notes and things, even where their practice or their trust haven't yet caught up with them. \"Now, lots of issues there - not encouraging it - but it does tell me that contrary to this, 'Oh, people don't want to change, staff are very happy and they are really resistant to change', it's the opposite. People are crying out for this stuff.\" Read more from Sky News:National investigation launched into maternity servicesEvery baby in the UK to receive DNA testing Doctors who use AI that complies with national standards already say there are big benefits. Anil Mehta, a doctor in the health secretary's Ilford constituency, told Sky News he backed his MP's drive for more AI technology in healthcare. \"I spend 30% of my week doing paperwork,\" he said. \"So I think once I've explained all of those features of what we're doing, patients are extremely reassured. And I haven't faced anybody that's not wanted to have me do this. He added: \"(I) think that consultation with your doctor is extremely confidential, so that's not changed at all. \"That remains confidential - so whether it's a vulnerable adult, a vulnerable child, teenager, young child with a parent, I think the concept of that confidentiality remains.\" An NHS spokesperson said: \"Ambient Voice Technology has the potential to transform care and improve efficiency and in April, the NHS issued guidance to support its use in a safe and secure way. \"We are working with NHS organisations and suppliers to ensure that all Ambient Voice Technology products used across the health service continue to be compliant with NHS standards on clinical safety and data security.\""

        "Content": "Stunning images showing distant parts of the universe - including one of a region situated thousands of light years from Earth - have been captured by a powerful new telescope. The camera at the Vera C Rubin Observatory in Chile is expected to reveal new details from space on an unprecedented scale as it makes further observations during the next decade. Scientists expect it to chart thousands of asteroids not previously identified - and believe it will discover within months whether there is a ninth planet in our solar system. The new images show the light from millions of stars and galaxies in observations which took the world's largest and most powerful camera only 10 hours to complete. One image shows a mosaic of the Trifid and Lagoon nebulae, a star-forming region which is 9,000 light years from Earth. A single light year is the distance light travels in 12 months. In space, it \"zips through at 186,000 miles per second and 5.88 trillion miles per year\", says NASA. Another image shows thousands of galaxies in the Virgo Cluster, in what scientists said offers just a \"peek at the cosmos\". The observatory is jointly funded by the National Science Foundation, an independent agency of the US government. The foundation's chief of staff Brian Stone told CNN the observatory \"will capture more information about our universe than all optical telescopes throughout history combined\". Rubin has been built on a mountain in the Andes, a region in central Chile which is also home to other observatories due to its dry air and dark skies. The telescope's work will \"capture the cosmos in exquisite detail\" as it repeatedly scans the sky for 10 years to \"create an ultra-wide, ultra-high-definition time-lapse record of our universe\". Read more from Sky News:Why Israel is believed to have nuclear weapons programmeEvery baby in the UK to receive DNA testing  Scientists in the UK will be working in partnership with the teams at Rubin to help process the detailed information and images captured by the telescope. The National Science Foundation is expected to release more images and video from Rubin's initial work later on Monday."

        "Content": "Nearly 200 firefighters are battling a major wildfire on the Greek island of Chios.  The fire started on Sunday in three separate locations near the main town, which is also called Chios. The flames were fanned by strong winds and turned into one large blaze. Local media footage and photos showed firefighters battling towering flames burning through woodland and farmland as night fell. Power cuts have also been reported. Greek authorities sent fresh evacuation notifications for two areas near Chios town on Monday morning. Push alerts have been sent to mobile phones in the area urging people to evacuate a total of 16 villages, settlements and neighbourhoods on the outskirts of the town. \"The situation remains critical as firefighting forces are still dealing with many active fronts, several of which being near hamlets,\" a Greek government spokesman said. The fire department said 190 firefighters were trying to control the fire on Monday, with strong winds hampering their efforts. Some 35 vehicles, five helicopters and two water-dropping planes were also involved in the effort. A specialist fire department arson investigation team has been sent to the eastern Aegean island to look into the causes.

Last year, hundreds of tourists and residents were forced to flee wildfires on the holiday island of Kos. In 2023, forest fires killed at least 20 people in the north of the country and forced 19,000 people to flee the island of Rhodes."

        "Content": "Former Sky News presenter Dermot Murnaghan has been diagnosed with prostate cancer. The 67-year-old announced his diagnosis on social media, saying it was one of stage four \"advanced\" cancer. He said he was \"fortunate to have a simply outstanding medical team\" looking after him that was \"administering the best possible care with expertise, compassion and sensitivity\". \"I'm responding positively to their excellent treatment, and feeling well,\" he added. \"I'm blessed to be fortified by the monumental love and support of my wife, family and close friends. \"Needless to say, my message to all men over 50, in high risk groups, or displaying symptoms, is get yourself tested and campaign for routine prostate screening by the NHS. \"Early detection is crucial. And be aware, this disease can sometimes progress rapidly without obvious symptoms.\" Murnaghan said he would be taking part in Sir Chris Hoy's charity bike ride in Glasgow in September, which aims to \"shine a spotlight\" on stage four cancer. Sir Chris was himself diagnosed with stage four prostate cancer in September 2023. Advanced prostate cancer is when the cancer cells have spread to other parts of the body, according to Macmillan Cancer Support. Murnaghan is a familiar face to Sky News viewers as one of its main presenters from 2007 until 2023. In September 2022, he announced the death of the late Queen Elizabeth II on the channel.
