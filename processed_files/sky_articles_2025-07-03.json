        "Content": " Liverpool star Diogo Jota has died in a car crash. The 28-year-old Portuguese forward died in the accident in the early hours of Thursday morning near Zamora, in northwestern Spain. His brother, Andre Silva, was also killed in the crash on the Rias Bajas Highway (A-52) near Palacios de Sanabria, heading towards Benavente.  Follow the latest updates following Diogo Jota's death Jota and Silva were driving to Santander to catch a ferry back to England ahead of the start of Liverpool's pre-season training on Monday, CNN Portugal reports. The news outlet reports that Jota was advised against flying back to England due to recent surgery. Police said the accident happened at 12.30am when the Lamborghini the pair were travelling in veered off the road. \"A vehicle left the road and everything indicates a tyre burst while overtaking,\" the Guardia Civil in Zamora told Sky Sports News in a statement. \"As a result of the accident, the car caught fire and both people were killed. Pending the completion of forensic tests, one of the deceased has been identified as Diogo Jota, a Liverpool FC player, and his brother, Andre Felipe.\" A Spanish government source told the PA news agency that police were investigating the crash as \"a possible speeding incident\". Police added that no other vehicles were involved in the incident. Pictures of the aftermath of the crash showed debris scattered along the side of the road, including what appeared to be charred parts of the vehicle. It comes just 10 days after the player married his long-term girlfriend, Rute Cardoso. He had three children. The footballer, who played as a striker for Liverpool, began his career in his native Portugal and played at Atletico Madrid in Spain before moving to England. He joined the Merseyside club from Wolverhampton Wanderers in 2020. Jota played an important role throughout his five years with the Reds, including scoring six times in Liverpool's recent Premier League-winning season. He scored a total of 47 times in 123 matches for the club. He also played 49 times for the Portugal national side, scoring 14 times. Silva, 25, played for Penafiel, a Portuguese second division club. Teammates and football legends pay tribute A statement issued by Liverpool FC said the club was \"devastated\" by their player's death. \"The club have been informed the 28-year-old has passed away following a road traffic accident in Spain along with his brother, Andre,\" the club said in a statement. \"Liverpool FC will be making no further comment at this time and request the privacy of Diogo and Andre's family, friends, teammates and club staff is respected as they try to come to terms with an unimaginable loss. \"We will continue to provide them with our full support.\"  The Portuguese football federation said it was \"utterly devastated by the deaths\". \"Far beyond being an exceptional player, with nearly 50 caps for the national team, Diogo Jota was an extraordinary person, respected by all teammates and opponents, someone with a contagious joy and a reference within his own community. \"We have lost two champions. The passing of Diogo and Andre Silva represents irreparable losses for Portuguese Football, and we will do everything to honour their legacy daily.\" The Portugal and Spain women's teams held a minute's silence for Jota and Silva before their match in the Women's Euros in Switzerland on Thursday evening. It came after Liverpool's manager Arne Slot said in a statement: \"What can anyone say at a time like this when the shock and the pain is so incredibly raw? I wish I had the words but I know I do not. \"All I have are feelings that I know so many people will share about a person and a player we loved dearly and a family we care so much about. \"My first thoughts are not those of a football manager. They are of a father, a son, a brother and an uncle and they belong to the family of Diogo and Andre Silva who have experienced such an unimaginable loss.\" Jota's former manager at Liverpool, Jurgen Klopp, offered his thoughts in a post on Instagram. \"This is a moment where I struggle! There must be a bigger purpose, but I can't see it,\" he said. \"I'm heartbroken to hear about the passing of Diogo and his brother Andre. Diogo was not only a fantastic player, but also a great friend, a loving and caring husband and father. \"We will miss you so much. All my prayers, thoughts and power to Rute, the kids, the family, the friends and everyone who loved them.\" Liverpool captain Virgil van Dijk posted on Instagram: \"What a human being, what a player, but most importantly what an unbelievable family man. \"You mean so much to all of us and you always will!\" Cristiano Ronaldo, Jota's captain in the national team, said: \"It doesn't make sense. Just now we were together in the National Team, just now you had gotten married. \"To your family, your wife, and your children, I send my condolences and wish them all the strength in the world. \"I know you will always be with them. Rest in Peace, Diogo and Andre. We will all miss you.\"  Jota's Liverpool teammates Darwin Nunez, Cody Gakpo and Dominik Szoboszlai have also paid tribute. Szoboszlai wrote: \"Words cannot describe how heartbroken and devastated we are... Your smile, your love for the game will never be forgotten. \"We will miss you so much, but you will stay with us forever, on and off the pitch.\" Jota's former teammates Trent Alexander-Arnold, Sadio Mane, Roberto Firmino and Thiago Alcantara have also shared messages on social media. Mane posted a picture of himself and Jota with heartbreak emojis. It came as Liverpool legend Kenny Dalglish wrote on X: \"You feel helpless, knowing there's so little we can do to ease the pain for his wife of just two weeks, his three beautiful children.\" Liverpool legend Steven Gerrard shared an image of Jota on Instagram and wrote: \"Condolences to his family and friends during this incredibly sad time.\" Liverpool owners Billy Hogan, John Henry and Tom Werner, who are part of the Fenway Sports Group, said: \"This tragic situation and the reality of it is truly shocking, devastating and has left us numb with grief.\" Football icon Lionel Messi has also paid tribute, sharing an image of Jota on Instagram with the message \"QEPD\" - short for the Spanish phrase 'que en paz descanse', which translates to \"may he rest in peace'\". European football clubs such as Barcelona and AC Milan have also shared messages, along with basketball player LeBron James and tennis icon Rafael Nadal. Meanwhile Liverpool FC have opened a physical and digital book of condolence for supporters and members of the public to sign. The physical book is at the club's stadium, in the Anfield Road Stand reception area until Sunday evening. An avid video gamer, Jota also owned an eSports team and regularly streamed on Twitch."

        "Content": "\n          Sports correspondent\n              @RobHarris\n  The joy that filled the final weeks of Diogo Jota's life makes his death even more devastating to comprehend for his family and millions of fans worldwide. The most illustrious title of his career was won in May, when he paraded through Liverpool with his teammates and the Premier League trophy. More success came with Portugal as he won the Nations League for a second time alongside Cristiano Ronaldo in June. And then came the bliss at marrying his childhood love Rute Cardoso, watched by their three children. Latest: Liverpool players pay tribute to Jota Just yesterday Jota posted a video from the ceremony on social media alongside the message \"a day we will never forget\". The happiest of days was remembered before the tragedy that killed Jota and his brother Andre Felipe in northwest Spain. Brothers - whose careers both developed at their hometown club, Porto - so tragically dying together. \"Football has lost two great men,\" Porto president Andre Villas-Boas said, as fans descended on the club's stadium to mourn. At Anfield, Liverpool fans are grieving the versatile forward who was so often in the shadow of Mohamed Salah, as he was under Ronaldo at Portugal. But he knew how to sacrifice stardom to contribute to the squad. The last of his 65 Liverpool goals was the winner in the Merseyside derby against neighbours Everton in April - helping the club become the record 20-time champions of England. A Premier League winners' medal joining those from the FA Cup and League Cup, won by the 28-year-old after he joined the Reds in 2020. It was Wolverhampton Wanderers who gave Jota a platform to shine in England after he joined from Atletico Madrid. Promotion was gained to the Premier League in 2018, and they more than just avoided relegation, but secured back-to-back top-seven finishes. Jota was a reason why.  He was also why Wolves could embark on such a memorable European campaign, and scored two hat-tricks in the run-up to the Europa League quarter-finals in 2020. \"The memories he created will never be forgotten,\" Wolves said. For the football world, the loss of such a talent so young will be hard to comprehend. And so many are reflecting on the fragility of life as football grieves from Liverpool to Portugal - and beyond."

        "Content": "\n          International affairs editor\n              @DominicWaghorn\n  Iran's foreign ministry has told Sky News there is still a chance for peace talks with the United States. In an interview in Iran's foreign ministry in Tehran, a senior Iranian official said despite the attacks on his country by America and Israel, back-channel efforts are under way to restart the search for a diplomatic solution. The comments will be seen as an olive branch for the Trump administration to seize as it explores a diplomatic way forward. Sky News is one of only a handful of foreign news organisations allowed access to Iran following its short and devastating war with Israel. We also filmed the impact of Israel's attacks on ordinary Iranians in Tehran. In the wake of a ceasefire declared by Donald Trump, Esmaeil Baqaei, the Iranian foreign ministry spokesman, said the US must show it is genuine in its desire for peace. \"Diplomacy must not be abused or used as a tool for deception or for simply a sort of psychological warfare against their adversaries.\"  Iran felt diplomacy had been betrayed, he said. US-Iranian talks were on the verge of reconvening when Israel attacked his country. And America had breached international law in its support of what he called \"Zionist aggression\". But Mr Baqaei said \"diplomacy never ends, there are contacts, indirectly. My minister is talking to Oman, Qatar and others\". President Trump says he is ready to talk with Iran, but major stumbling blocks need to be overcome. The US wants Iran to give up nuclear enrichment completely. Iran has long insisted it has the right to carry on. Read more from Sky News: Diogo Jota's tragic final Instagram post after marrying childhood sweetheartThousands of passengers hit by wave of flight cancellations  Across town, we witnessed the impact of Israel's attacks in Gisha, an upmarket neighbourhood of Tehran. Israel claims its attacks on Iranian figures were precision-targeted. In reality they appear to have been far from surgical. The airstrike came at 10.30 Friday morning two weeks ago. It ripped a hole through four floors of reinforced concrete in the residential apartment block. The target may have been a nuclear scientist living there, but everyone in the building is now without a home. Engineers say it will almost certainly need to be torn down. The mood in the Iranian capital seems subdued and tense. Iranians fear Israelis will renew their air campaign despite the ceasefire, but the foreign ministry spokesperson said they \"will respond\" to any Israeli attack. There is widespread resentment of the leadership after nationwide social unrest and massive economic problems. But the Israeli attacks have rallied many Iranians around their government all the same. They had hoped diplomacy with America could deliver a new deal and an end to sanctions, then Israel began its 12-day aerial onslaught and the US joined in. Iranians hope somehow talks can be restarted, but they also know the chances of progress are, for now at least, not great."

        "Content": " Israeli-backed American contractors guarding aid centres in Gaza are using live ammunition and stun grenades as starving Palestinians scramble for food, an investigation has claimed. The Associated Press has reported the accounts by two contractors from the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF), although the organisation has strongly denied the allegations, describing them as \"categorically false\". GHF was established in February to deliver desperately needed aid to people in the besieged enclave, but its work has been heavily criticised by international aid groups. It has also been subject to intense scrutiny about its operations, which Sky News previously reported are associated with a significant increase in deaths. AP's claims, which have not been independently verified by Sky News, came from GHF contractors who spoke on condition of anonymity as they were revealing their employer's internal operations. They said they were motivated to speak out as they were disturbed by what they considered dangerous practices by security staff who were often heavily armed. AP reported the contractors had claimed \"their colleagues regularly lobbed stun grenades and pepper spray in the direction of the Palestinians\" and \"bullets were fired in all directions - in the air, into the ground and at times toward the Palestinians, recalling at least one instance where he thought someone had been hit\". \n                  What's it actually like in Iran right now?\n                 \n                  94 killed in Israeli strikes in Gaza, health authorities say – as UN expert calls situation ‘apocalyptic’\n                 \n                  Benjamin Netanyahu to meet Donald Trump next week amid calls for Gaza ceasefire\n                 Contractor: 'Innocent people being hurt' \"There are innocent people being hurt. Badly. Needlessly,\" the contractor told AP. Videos reportedly provided by one contractor show aid sites, located in Israeli military-controlled zones, with hundreds of Palestinians crammed between metal gates, scrambling to reach aid. In the background, gunfire can be heard, and stun grenades are allegedly fired into crowds. The footage does not show who was shooting or what was being shot at, but another video shows contractors in a compound, when bursts of gunfire can be heard. One man is then heard shouting in celebration: \"Whoo! Whoo!\". \"I think you hit one,\" another says, followed by the comment: \"Hell, yeah, boy!\" The contractor who took the video told AP that colleagues were shooting in the direction of Palestinians. Read more:Gaza ceasefire proposal a significant moment'More than 90 killed' in Israeli strikes in GazaWhy Netanyahu wants 90-day ceasefire - analysis According to the Hamas-run Gaza Health Ministry and witnesses, several hundred people have been killed and hundreds more wounded since the GHF sites started operating more than a month ago, amid claims by Palestinians of Israeli troops opening fire almost every day at crowds seeking to reach the aid. In response, Israel's military says it fires only warning shots and is investigating reports of civilian harm. It denies deliberately shooting at any innocent civilians and says it's examining how to reduce \"friction with the population\" in the areas surrounding the distribution centres. GHF attacks 'false claims' GHF has vehemently denied the accusations, adding that it has investigated AP's allegations. In a statement on X, GHF wrote: \"Based on time-stamped video footage and sworn witness statements, we have concluded that the claims in the AP's story are categorically false. At no point were civilians under fire at a GHF distribution site. \"The gunfire heard in the video was confirmed to have originated from the IDF, who was outside the immediate vicinity of the GHF distribution site. \"It was not directed at individuals, and no one was shot or injured. What is most troubling is that the AP refused to share the full video with us prior to publication, despite the seriousness of the allegations.\" Safe Reach Solutions, the logistics company subcontracted by GHF, told the AP there have been no serious injuries at any of their sites to date. But the organisation admitted that, in isolated incidents, security professionals fired live rounds into the ground and away from civilians to get their attention. A Safe Reach Solutions spokesperson told AP this happened at the start of their operations at \"the height of desperation where crowd control measures were necessary for the safety and security of civilians\"."

Politics latest: Zarah Sultana's stinging resignation letter Ms Sultana also said she was \"resigning\" from the Labour Party after 14 years.

Mr Corbyn and the other four independents have not said if they are part of the new party Ms Sultana announced. In her announcement, Ms Sultana said she would vote to abolish the two-child benefit cap again and also voted against scrapping the winter fuel payment for most pensioners. Ms Sultana also voted against the government's welfare bill this week, which was heavily watered down as Sir Keir Starmer tried to prevent a major rebellion from his own MPs. Analysis: New party could see Starmer surrounded - if it gets off the ground  On Wednesday, Ms Sultana spoke passionately against Palestine Action being proscribed as a terror organisation - but MPs eventually voted for it to be put into law. She said to proscribe it is \"a deliberate distortion of the law to chill dissent, criminalise solidarity and suppress the truth\". The MP also shouted: \"We are all Palestine Action.\" Ms Sultana said they were founding the new party because \"Westminster is broken but the real crisis is deeper - just 50 families now own more wealth than half the UK population\". She called Reform leader Nigel Farage \"a billionaire-backed grifter\" leading the polls \"because Labour has completely failed to improve people's lives\". The MP signed the letter off with: \"In 2029, the choice will be stark: socialism or barbarism. \"Billionaires already have three parties fighting for them.

        "Content": "\n          Economics and data editor\n              @EdConwaySky\n  You're probably tired by now of hearing all about \"black holes\". It's one of those phrases trotted out by journalists in an effort to make economic policy sound a little more interesting. And in some senses it's a massively misleading image. After all, when people talk about fiscal holes, what they're really talking about is something rather prosaic: the amount of money it would take for the chancellor not to break her fiscal rules. Those fiscal rules are not god-given, after all. They were confected by the chancellor herself. Missing them will not really result in Britain sliding into infinite nothingness. Even so, whatever you choose to call the dilemma she's faced with right now, it's certainly quite a big deal. And understanding this helps provide a little context for the extraordinary events of the past few days, with markets sliding in the wake of Ms Reeves' teary appearance at Prime Minister's Questions. Following that moment, the yield on UK government debt - the rate of interest we're being charged by international investors - suddenly leapt higher. Granted, the jump was nothing like what we saw in the wake of Liz Truss's mini-budget. And those yields dropped down after the prime minister backed the chancellor. UK's a global outlier \n                  Donald Trump's 'big beautiful' tax cuts bill passes final hurdle in US Congress \n                 \n                  Ryanair and easyJet cancel hundreds of flights over air traffic control strike\n                 \n                  Ryanair to increase size of underseat free bag by 20% following EU proposals\n                 Even so, they underline one very important bit of context. The UK has become something of an outlier in global debt markets. For years, the yield on our benchmark government bonds was more or less middle of the industrialised-world pack. But since 2022's drama, it has hovered unnervingly high, above every other G7 nation. That speaks to a broader issue. Britain might not have the biggest deficit in the G7, or for that matter, the highest national debt. Others (most notably France, and to some extent, too, the US) face even more desperate fiscal dilemmas in the coming years. But markets do still seem nervous about Britain. Perhaps that's because of what they (and we) all endured in 2022 - when British gilt markets stepped briefly over the precipice, causing malfunctions all around the financial system (most notably in obscure parts of the pensions investment sector). But it also owes something to the fact that the chancellor's own fiscal plans are sailing worryingly close to the wind. Reeves made fiscal rules matter The main piece of evidence here is the amount of leeway she has left herself against her fiscal rules. As I said at the start, there's nothing gospel about these rules. But having created them and banged on about them for a long time, even those of us who are a little sceptical about fiscal rules would concede that breaking them is, as they say, not a good look. Back in spring, the Office for Budget Responsibility thought the chancellor had about £9.9bn in leeway against these rules. But since then, she has u-turned on both the cuts in winter fuel payments and on personal independence payments. That reduces the £9.9bn down to barely more than £3bn. Read more:Airlines cancel hundreds of flights over air traffic control strikeMore bad news for Elon Musk as Tesla deliveries miss target again But the real issue isn't just these U-turns. It's something else. The stronger the economy is, the more tax revenues come in and the more her potential headroom against the fiscal rules would be. By the same token, if the economy grows less rapidly than the OBR expected, that would mean less tax revenues and an even bigger deficit. And if you compare the OBR's latest forecasts with the current average of forecasts among independent forecasters, or for that matter, the Bank of England, they do look decidedly optimistic. If the OBR is right and everyone else is wrong, then the chancellor \"only\" has to fill in the hole left by those U-turns. But if the OBR is wrong and everyone else is right, things get considerably more grisly. Even a small downgrade in the OBR's expectations for productivity growth - say a 0.1 percentage point drop - would obliterate the remaining headroom and leave the chancellor with a £6bn shortfall against her rule. Anything more than that (and bear in mind, most economists think the OBR is out by more than that) and she could be £10bn or more underwater. Now, there are plenty of very reasonable points one could make about how silly this all is. It's silly that so many people treat fiscal rules as tablets of stone. It's silly that government tax policy from one year to the next seems to hinge on how right or wrong the OBR's economic forecasts are. Yet all this stuff, silly as it might all seem, is taken quite seriously by markets right now. They look at the UK, see an outlier, and tend to focus more than usual on black holes. So I'm afraid we're going to be talking about \"black holes\" for quite some time to come."

        "Content": "Sir Keir Starmer should use his deputy Angela Rayner more effectively because she is popular with the public, Harriet Harman has said. Speaking to Sky News political editor Beth Rigby on the Electoral Dysfunction podcast, Baroness Harman said the prime minister can use his deputy in two ways after she successfully led the effort behind the scenes to save the government's welfare bill from being defeated in the Commons by rebel Labour MPs. \"There's two ways he could respond to the situation about Angela Rayner,\" she said. \"One is to feel defensive about it and that is somehow undermining his power. \"He's got to find ways to sort of fence her in or to actually recognise that she's a great communicator, that she's popular, people like her, and actually he needs to pull her into his leadership and use her for what she can actually bring in. \"The way that Tony Blair used John Prescott to actually augment his premiership.\" Despite the many U-turns the government was forced into over the welfare bill, it would ultimately have been worse if a Labour rebellion defeated the bill entirely on Tuesday. Instead, it was voted through with a majority of 75 - still not a great result for a government with a working majority of 165.

She said: \"We are now utterly tipped into that territory which I think is incredibly unfortunate that we've got to be having the debate dominated now between now and the budget about tax raising. \"I think that is an extremely unfortunate consequence of what's happened over the last few days and who knows where we'll be, in terms of this so-called headroom, by the time we get to the autumn? But that's now where the narrative is. \"So, the job has got much more difficult. But it's a job they've got to do.\" The original welfare bill reforms, including narrowing eligibility for the main disability benefit, were meant to save the government £5.5bn but the Institute for Fiscal Studies said the U-turns now mean they will cost the taxpayer. This has prompted questions about Chancellor Rachel Reeves's job security, but Baroness Harman backed Ms Reeves and said she is \"the solution to the problem\"."

        "Content": "Donald Trump's 'big beautiful bill' has been passed by the US congress, sending it to the president to sign into law. The controversial tax breaks and spending cuts package cleared its final hurdle as the Republican-controlled House of Representatives narrowly approved the bill with a 218-214 vote. The bill delivers tax breaks Mr Trump promised in his 2024 election campaign, cuts health and food safety programmes, and zeroes out dozens of green energy incentives. According to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office (CBO), it will lower tax revenues by $4.5trn over 10 years and add $3.4trn to the US's $36.2trn debt. But despite concerns over the 869-page bill's price tag - and its hit to healthcare programmes - Republicans largely lined up in support, with just two rebelling on the vote. Every Democrat in Congress voted against the bill, blasting it as a giveaway to the wealthy that will leave millions of Americans uninsured. House Speaker Mike Johnson made the Republicans' closing argument for the bill, telling Congress: \"For everyday Americans, this means real, positive change that they can feel.\" \n                  Vladimir Putin tells Donald Trump he will not back down from goals in Ukraine, Kremlin says\n                 \n                  What's it actually like in Iran right now?\n                 \n                  Veteran Democrat Jack Lew expresses dismay at US deficit but blames Joe Biden too\n                 Earlier, the House's Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries gave a record-breaking eight-hour and 44-minute speech against it. \"The focus of this bill, the justification for all of the cuts that will hurt everyday Americans, is to provide massive tax breaks for billionaires,\" he said. 👉 Follow Trump100 on your podcast app 👈 Trump plans Fourth of July bill signing ceremony Mr Trump will sign the bill into law on Friday at 5pm local time (10pm in the UK), the White House said. Speaking to reporters at Joint Base Andrews, Mr Trump hailed the package as \"the biggest bill ever signed of its kind\". \"It's going to make this country into a rocket ship,\" he added. The US president added that as he signs it into law - on the Fourth of July - fighter jets will fly over the White House. \"We'll be signing with those beautiful plans flying right over our heads,\" he said. What does the bill include?  The bill's spending cuts largely target Medicaid, the health programme that covers 71 million Americans on low incomes. It will tighten enrolment standards, institute a work requirement and clamp down on a funding mechanism used by states to boost federal payments. The changes could leave nearly 12 million people without health insurance, according to the CBO.

The bill narrowly passed the US Senate on Tuesday after vice president JD Vance cast the deciding vote to break a 50-50 tie."

        "Content": "By Ali Fortescue, political correspondent, and Hannah Woodward, political news editor  Wales should \"learn\" from the SNP's successes in Scotland, according to the man who could well be the next first minister of Wales.  Plaid Cymru leader Rhun ap Iorwerth told Sky News: \"I believe that we will not be able to fully release our potential until we're an independent nation.\" He admitted \"not everybody agrees\" but believes there should be a discussion about how to \"edge things forwards\" on independence. The party leader has ruled out a referendum in his first term but says support for Welsh independence is growing among young voters. Mr ap Iorwerth, whose party is neck and neck with Reform UK and Labour in the polls to lead the Welsh Parliament next year, says his party takes \"very, very seriously the positive impact\" the SNP has had in Scotland. It comes as a government minister admitted there are \"major\" questions about how fairly Wales is funded compared with Scotland. Stephen Kinnock, the Labour MP for Aberafan Maesteg, told Sky News he and other Welsh MPs are looking for a reassessment of the funding formula. \n                  Adam Price: Former Plaid Cymru leader's re-election uncertain under new voting system\n                 \n                  Sir Keir Starmer apologises for being 'overly rude' to Plaid Cymru MP Liz Saville Roberts\n                 \n                  Plaid Cymru 'ready to form' next government in Wales, says leader Rhun ap Iorwerth\n                 He said the Barnett formula, which decides the allocation of much of the funding from the treasury to devolved nations, works \"much better\" for Scotland and the industrial heritage and age demographics in Wales mean the nation has been historically underserved. Read more:How Wales' Sennedd went from local authority like to fully fledged parliament in 25 years Since Mr Kinnock spoke to Sky News, Wales was awarded £5bn in revenue and capital over three years, largely for rail infrastructure, in the spending review. However, some Welsh Labour MPs fear the growing nationalist tide could mirror Scotland's 2007 shift. Lessons \"have not been learned\" from Scotland, Labour Member of the Welsh Parliament Lee Waters said. Speaking to the Labour List website, he warned: \"The control of the party machinery by London HQ, and the disdain of Westminster MPs towards their devolved counterparts were features now and then.\" Mr Waters sounded the alarm for Welsh Labour, adding: \"Scottish Labour paid the price for it in 2007. The SNP seized on its chance to form a minority government and used it to build a generation of dominance. Plaid Cymru aim to do the same.\" Political correspondent It's a question that could propel Reform UK or Plaid Cymru to power in Wales this time next year - a seismic political shift in a nation dominated by Welsh Labour since devolution began. \n The closure of the blast furnaces at Port Talbot, the end of virgin steelmaking in this country, drew comparisons with the government's intervention at Scunthorpe in Lincolnshire. Why was an English steelmaking site saved and not a Welsh one? \n The answer, as Wales MP and government minister Stephen Kinnock tells me, is not straightforward. \n The owners of Scunthorpe were \"actively sabotaging the blast furnaces\", and Labour were not in power in Westminster when decisions about Port Talbot were being made. \n \"You have to set the bar really high when you're going to, as a government, go in and seize the assets of a private company,\" he said. \n But Port Talbot has become symbolic of something bigger, and it's not just about steel. \n Last month, a new railway line between Oxford and Cambridge was classed as an England and Wales project, meaning Wales does not get a share of funding, and earlier this year Wales' first minister said the allocation of HS2 funding was \"unfair\" for Wales. \n But Welsh Labour's Eluned Morgan may not have done enough to distance herself from the national party. \n Jac Larner from Wales' Governance Centre at Cardiff University says her emphasis on the close relationship between Welsh and UK Labour echoes the message from Scottish Labour before their vote collapsed. It makes it \"easier for voters to punish both\" he said. \n Launching his party's so-called contract with voters in Merthyr Tydfil, Nigel Farage said Wales has been \"let down\". \n The Reform UK leaders' progress in Wales has been notable, but as has that of a lesser known party leader, Plaid Cymru's Rhun ap Iorwerth. \n Can Wales' nationalist party echo the SNP's success in Scotland? Both parties are fishing in the same waters for disillusioned Labour voters. Both have a real shot at power in Wales. \n Reform UK are also tapping into a mood of discontent in Wales. Leader Nigel Farage has put re-industrialisation at the centre of his pitch and even pledged to reopen Port Talbot's steel blast furnaces. In last year's general election, Reform UK came second in 13 of the 32 Welsh constituencies.  Those close to Mr Farage suggest he sees the Welsh elections next year as an important stepping stone in his ambitions to get to 10 Downing Street. Asked about Reform UK, the Plaid Cymru leader said he sees it as his \"duty\" to keep the party out of power in Wales. Mr ap Iorwerth said Mr Farage's party \"have no particular interest in developing policy for Wales\"."

        "Content": " Liverpool star Diogo Jota has died in a car crash. The 28-year-old Portuguese forward died in the accident in the early hours of Thursday morning near Zamora, in northwestern Spain. His brother, Andre Silva, was also killed in the crash on the Rias Bajas Highway (A-52) near Palacios de Sanabria, heading towards Benavente.  Follow the latest updates following Diogo Jota's death Jota and Silva were driving to Santander to catch a ferry back to England ahead of the start of Liverpool's pre-season training on Monday, CNN Portugal reports. The news outlet reports that Jota was advised against flying back to England due to recent surgery. Police said the accident happened at 12.30am when the Lamborghini the pair were travelling in veered off the road. \"A vehicle left the road and everything indicates a tyre burst while overtaking,\" the Guardia Civil in Zamora told Sky Sports News in a statement. \"As a result of the accident, the car caught fire and both people were killed. Pending the completion of forensic tests, one of the deceased has been identified as Diogo Jota, a Liverpool FC player, and his brother, Andre Felipe.\" A Spanish government source told the PA news agency that police were investigating the crash as \"a possible speeding incident\". Police added that no other vehicles were involved in the incident. Pictures of the aftermath of the crash showed debris scattered along the side of the road, including what appeared to be charred parts of the vehicle. It comes just 10 days after the player married his long-term girlfriend, Rute Cardoso. He had three children. The footballer, who played as a striker for Liverpool, began his career in his native Portugal and played at Atletico Madrid in Spain before moving to England. He joined the Merseyside club from Wolverhampton Wanderers in 2020. Jota played an important role throughout his five years with the Reds, including scoring six times in Liverpool's recent Premier League-winning season. He scored a total of 47 times in 123 matches for the club. He also played 49 times for the Portugal national side, scoring 14 times. Silva, 25, played for Penafiel, a Portuguese second division club. Teammates and football legends pay tribute A statement issued by Liverpool FC said the club was \"devastated\" by their player's death. \"The club have been informed the 28-year-old has passed away following a road traffic accident in Spain along with his brother, Andre,\" the club said in a statement. \"Liverpool FC will be making no further comment at this time and request the privacy of Diogo and Andre's family, friends, teammates and club staff is respected as they try to come to terms with an unimaginable loss. \"We will continue to provide them with our full support.\"  The Portuguese football federation said it was \"utterly devastated by the deaths\". \"Far beyond being an exceptional player, with nearly 50 caps for the national team, Diogo Jota was an extraordinary person, respected by all teammates and opponents, someone with a contagious joy and a reference within his own community. \"We have lost two champions. The passing of Diogo and Andre Silva represents irreparable losses for Portuguese Football, and we will do everything to honour their legacy daily.\" The Portugal and Spain women's teams held a minute's silence for Jota and Silva before their match in the Women's Euros in Switzerland on Thursday evening. It came after Liverpool's manager Arne Slot said in a statement: \"What can anyone say at a time like this when the shock and the pain is so incredibly raw? I wish I had the words but I know I do not. \"All I have are feelings that I know so many people will share about a person and a player we loved dearly and a family we care so much about. \"My first thoughts are not those of a football manager. They are of a father, a son, a brother and an uncle and they belong to the family of Diogo and Andre Silva who have experienced such an unimaginable loss.\" Jota's former manager at Liverpool, Jurgen Klopp, offered his thoughts in a post on Instagram. \"This is a moment where I struggle! There must be a bigger purpose, but I can't see it,\" he said. \"I'm heartbroken to hear about the passing of Diogo and his brother Andre. Diogo was not only a fantastic player, but also a great friend, a loving and caring husband and father. \"We will miss you so much. All my prayers, thoughts and power to Rute, the kids, the family, the friends and everyone who loved them.\" Liverpool captain Virgil van Dijk posted on Instagram: \"What a human being, what a player, but most importantly what an unbelievable family man. \"You mean so much to all of us and you always will!\" Cristiano Ronaldo, Jota's captain in the national team, said: \"It doesn't make sense. Just now we were together in the National Team, just now you had gotten married. \"To your family, your wife, and your children, I send my condolences and wish them all the strength in the world. \"I know you will always be with them. Rest in Peace, Diogo and Andre. We will all miss you.\"  Jota's Liverpool teammates Darwin Nunez, Cody Gakpo and Dominik Szoboszlai have also paid tribute.

Mane posted a picture of himself and Jota with heartbreak emojis. It came as Liverpool legend Kenny Dalglish wrote on X: \"You feel helpless, knowing there's so little we can do to ease the pain for his wife of just two weeks, his three beautiful children.\" Liverpool legend Steven Gerrard shared an image of Jota on Instagram and wrote: \"Condolences to his family and friends during this incredibly sad time.\" Liverpool owners Billy Hogan, John Henry and Tom Werner, who are part of the Fenway Sports Group, said: \"This tragic situation and the reality of it is truly shocking, devastating and has left us numb with grief.\" Football icon Lionel Messi has also paid tribute, sharing an image of Jota on Instagram with the message \"QEPD\" - short for the Spanish phrase 'que en paz descanse', which translates to \"may he rest in peace'\". European football clubs such as Barcelona and AC Milan have also shared messages, along with basketball player LeBron James and tennis icon Rafael Nadal. Meanwhile Liverpool FC have opened a physical and digital book of condolence for supporters and members of the public to sign. The physical book is at the club's stadium, in the Anfield Road Stand reception area until Sunday evening. An avid video gamer, Jota also owned an eSports team and regularly streamed on Twitch."

        "Content": "\n          Sports correspondent\n              @RobHarris\n  The joy that filled the final weeks of Diogo Jota's life makes his death even more devastating to comprehend for his family and millions of fans worldwide. The most illustrious title of his career was won in May, when he paraded through Liverpool with his teammates and the Premier League trophy. More success came with Portugal as he won the Nations League for a second time alongside Cristiano Ronaldo in June. And then came the bliss at marrying his childhood love Rute Cardoso, watched by their three children. Latest: Liverpool players pay tribute to Jota Just yesterday Jota posted a video from the ceremony on social media alongside the message \"a day we will never forget\". The happiest of days was remembered before the tragedy that killed Jota and his brother Andre Felipe in northwest Spain. Brothers - whose careers both developed at their hometown club, Porto - so tragically dying together. \"Football has lost two great men,\" Porto president Andre Villas-Boas said, as fans descended on the club's stadium to mourn. At Anfield, Liverpool fans are grieving the versatile forward who was so often in the shadow of Mohamed Salah, as he was under Ronaldo at Portugal. But he knew how to sacrifice stardom to contribute to the squad. The last of his 65 Liverpool goals was the winner in the Merseyside derby against neighbours Everton in April - helping the club become the record 20-time champions of England. A Premier League winners' medal joining those from the FA Cup and League Cup, won by the 28-year-old after he joined the Reds in 2020. It was Wolverhampton Wanderers who gave Jota a platform to shine in England after he joined from Atletico Madrid. Promotion was gained to the Premier League in 2018, and they more than just avoided relegation, but secured back-to-back top-seven finishes. Jota was a reason why.  He was also why Wolves could embark on such a memorable European campaign, and scored two hat-tricks in the run-up to the Europa League quarter-finals in 2020. \"The memories he created will never be forgotten,\" Wolves said. For the football world, the loss of such a talent so young will be hard to comprehend. And so many are reflecting on the fragility of life as football grieves from Liverpool to Portugal - and beyond."

Marlon West, 51, said Scarlett, now 20, was an academic student at a school in Greater Manchester. She was happy with a good friendship group and enjoyed riding her horse, Jasper. But her life changed after she was attacked by a gang at a bus station - they started bullying her and she decided it was better to become their friends. An older female member then started grooming her for rape gangs made up of Muslim men, her father told Sky News. Mr West said six men were involved in grooming her from the age of 14 but she was raped by more than 60 before the abuse finally stopped shortly before she turned 18. By then, she was too terrified to leave home. \"Scarlett isn't a survivor and a lot of these other girls aren't survivors,\" he said. \"The reason being is they're still living with the trauma every day.\" Mr West, an advanced nurse practitioner for mental health services at the NHS, said his daughter was thrown out of school aged 14 and would go missing for weeks at a time. On one occasion, he tracked her down to a property in Derbyshire, but when he eventually persuaded police to attend, he was told Scarlett was \"safe\" with the woman who groomed her and \"her friends\". Mr West said he was \"absolutely furious\" when police and social services dismissed the abuse as \"a lifestyle choice\" and was so desperate he put Scarlett into care when she was 15. \"I couldn't keep her safe,\" he said. \"It's the hardest decision of my life.\" But within a week of her returning home, when she had to leave the care system after turning 16, she was going missing again. Mr West said the female groomer had stayed in contact with Scarlett and \"was literally waiting for her\" when she came home. She was then trafficked all over the country, including Bradford, Birmingham and London. Mr West said he had to \"scream\" at police to track her down before they raided a property in Rochdale where she was found along with heroin and crack cocaine. Scarlett was arrested and released on bail, but wasn't charged because she was on a Home Office database as being at risk of trafficking, he said. \"Even though that [arrest] was inappropriate, that stopped it because she was terrified of going out of the house, which she still is now to a certain extent.\" Mr West believes the abuse also came to an end because she was getting older and her abusers were no longer interested. \"This is not just about child sexual exploitation but also criminal exploitation - she was doing county lines, she was picking up firearms for them,\" he said. Mr West said any child can be at risk of grooming. \"They're stereotyping a lot of these survivors, that they're coming from broken homes, or they're in care,\" he said. \"A groomer doesn't stand outside a school gate and think, 'I'm not grooming her because her dad's a doctor or her dad's a GP' - they don't care. Once they target, that's it.\" Mr West was speaking as a report by police watchdogs revealed Greater Manchester Police has live grooming investigations involving 714 victims and survivors. The force said it has 1,099 lines of enquiry relating to potential suspects but only 269 who are confirmed. \"I think there's more - a lot of survivors haven't come forward. One, because they're probably still being groomed and secondly because they're terrified of GMP and how they've been treated in the past,\" he said. \"It's higher than it's ever been. Services such as police and social services are terrified of political correctness. \"The groomers know they can get away with it because there aren't many arrests and so it's increased.\" GMP Chief Constable Sir Stephen Watson promised to go after child rapists and paedophiles \"relentlessly\" after the publication of the report, which was largely positive about the force's turnaround in tackling the gangs. But Mr West believes they are \"still failing\", although he welcomed the investigation opened into his daughter's case. He said he is \"hopeful\" the national inquiry into grooming gangs by the government last month \"will expose a lot of the cover-ups and give accountability\" but is worried about the involvement of services such as councils and police forces because of a lack of trust. A GMP spokesperson said: \"We have met with Scarlett and her father and we're conducting an extensive investigation into their allegations. \"While we understand the impact of their experiences cannot be undone, we aim to ensure that the experience of the GMP of today would be much improved from that of previous years.\" A Tameside Council spokesperson previously said they were legally unable to comment on Scarlett's case. But they said: \"Where any concerns or issues are raised we work closely with individuals, families and our partners to provide support and resolve, as appropriate. \"Where individuals aren't satisfied with the services received, we do have a statutory complaints procedure and individuals can ultimately take their complaint to the Local Government & Social Care Ombudsman.\""

Analysis: New party could see Starmer surrounded - if it gets off the ground  On Wednesday, Ms Sultana spoke passionately against Palestine Action being proscribed as a terror organisation - but MPs eventually voted for it to be put into law. She said to proscribe it is \"a deliberate distortion of the law to chill dissent, criminalise solidarity and suppress the truth\". The MP also shouted: \"We are all Palestine Action.\" Ms Sultana said they were founding the new party because \"Westminster is broken but the real crisis is deeper - just 50 families now own more wealth than half the UK population\". She called Reform leader Nigel Farage \"a billionaire-backed grifter\" leading the polls \"because Labour has completely failed to improve people's lives\".

David Cheneler, 73, was among 93 registered sex offenders held by Met officers using the controversial technology since the start of last year. He was discovered with the girl after he was identified by a camera on a police van in Camberwell, south London, in January. Cheneler, from Lewisham, was jailed for two years in May after admitting breaching his sexual harm prevention order by being with a child under the age of 14. The Met said a total of 1,035 arrests have been made using live facial recognition technology - where live footage is recorded of people as they walk past, capturing their faces, which are then compared against a database of wanted offenders. If a match is determined, the system creates an alert which is assessed by an officer, who may decide to speak to the person. They include more than 100 people alleged to have been involved in serious violence against women and girls (VAWG) offences such as strangulation, stalking, domestic abuse, and rape. \n                  Man, 92, found guilty of rape and murder nearly 60 years ago\n                 \n                  Hainault sword rampage survivor recalls moment attacker told him: 'I'm going to kill you'\n                 \n                  Men guilty of plotting murder and running drugs empire on EncroChat\n                 Adenola Akindutire was stopped during an operation in Stratford and arrested over the machete robbery of a Rolex watch, which left the victim with life-changing injuries after the attack in Hayes, west London. Police said the 22-year-old, who was linked to a similar incident and had been released on bail, was in possession of a false passport and could have evaded arrest if it wasn't for the technology. Akindutire, of no fixed address, admitted charges including robbery, attempted robbery, grievous bodily harm, possession of a false identity document and two counts of possession of a bladed article and faces sentencing at Isleworth Crown Court. Darren Dubarry, 50, was already wanted for theft when he was caught with stolen designer clothing in Dalston, east London, after riding past an LFR camera on his bike. The 50-year-old, from Stratford, east London, was fined after pleading guilty to handling stolen goods. Lindsey Chiswick, the Met's LFR lead, hailed the 1,000 arrest milestone as \"a demonstration of how cutting-edge technology can make London safer by removing dangerous offenders from our streets\". \"Live Facial Recognition is a powerful tool, which is helping us deliver justice for victims, including those who have been subjected to horrendous offences, such as rape and serious assault,\" she said. \"It is not only saving our officers' valuable time but delivering faster, more accurate results to catch criminals - helping us be more efficient than ever before.\" The Met say \"robust safeguards\" are in place, which ensure no biometric data is retained from anyone who walks past an LFR camera who isn't wanted by police.

        "Content": "\n          Economics and data editor\n              @EdConwaySky\n  You're probably tired by now of hearing all about \"black holes\". It's one of those phrases trotted out by journalists in an effort to make economic policy sound a little more interesting. And in some senses it's a massively misleading image. After all, when people talk about fiscal holes, what they're really talking about is something rather prosaic: the amount of money it would take for the chancellor not to break her fiscal rules. Those fiscal rules are not god-given, after all. They were confected by the chancellor herself. Missing them will not really result in Britain sliding into infinite nothingness. Even so, whatever you choose to call the dilemma she's faced with right now, it's certainly quite a big deal. And understanding this helps provide a little context for the extraordinary events of the past few days, with markets sliding in the wake of Ms Reeves' teary appearance at Prime Minister's Questions. Following that moment, the yield on UK government debt - the rate of interest we're being charged by international investors - suddenly leapt higher. Granted, the jump was nothing like what we saw in the wake of Liz Truss's mini-budget. And those yields dropped down after the prime minister backed the chancellor. UK's a global outlier \n                  Donald Trump's 'big beautiful' tax cuts bill passes final hurdle in US Congress \n                 \n                  Ryanair and easyJet cancel hundreds of flights over air traffic control strike\n                 \n                  Ryanair to increase size of underseat free bag by 20% following EU proposals\n                 Even so, they underline one very important bit of context. The UK has become something of an outlier in global debt markets. For years, the yield on our benchmark government bonds was more or less middle of the industrialised-world pack. But since 2022's drama, it has hovered unnervingly high, above every other G7 nation. That speaks to a broader issue. Britain might not have the biggest deficit in the G7, or for that matter, the highest national debt. Others (most notably France, and to some extent, too, the US) face even more desperate fiscal dilemmas in the coming years. But markets do still seem nervous about Britain. Perhaps that's because of what they (and we) all endured in 2022 - when British gilt markets stepped briefly over the precipice, causing malfunctions all around the financial system (most notably in obscure parts of the pensions investment sector). But it also owes something to the fact that the chancellor's own fiscal plans are sailing worryingly close to the wind. Reeves made fiscal rules matter The main piece of evidence here is the amount of leeway she has left herself against her fiscal rules. As I said at the start, there's nothing gospel about these rules. But having created them and banged on about them for a long time, even those of us who are a little sceptical about fiscal rules would concede that breaking them is, as they say, not a good look. Back in spring, the Office for Budget Responsibility thought the chancellor had about £9.9bn in leeway against these rules. But since then, she has u-turned on both the cuts in winter fuel payments and on personal independence payments. That reduces the £9.9bn down to barely more than £3bn. Read more:Airlines cancel hundreds of flights over air traffic control strikeMore bad news for Elon Musk as Tesla deliveries miss target again But the real issue isn't just these U-turns. It's something else. The stronger the economy is, the more tax revenues come in and the more her potential headroom against the fiscal rules would be. By the same token, if the economy grows less rapidly than the OBR expected, that would mean less tax revenues and an even bigger deficit. And if you compare the OBR's latest forecasts with the current average of forecasts among independent forecasters, or for that matter, the Bank of England, they do look decidedly optimistic. If the OBR is right and everyone else is wrong, then the chancellor \"only\" has to fill in the hole left by those U-turns. But if the OBR is wrong and everyone else is right, things get considerably more grisly. Even a small downgrade in the OBR's expectations for productivity growth - say a 0.1 percentage point drop - would obliterate the remaining headroom and leave the chancellor with a £6bn shortfall against her rule. Anything more than that (and bear in mind, most economists think the OBR is out by more than that) and she could be £10bn or more underwater. Now, there are plenty of very reasonable points one could make about how silly this all is. It's silly that so many people treat fiscal rules as tablets of stone. It's silly that government tax policy from one year to the next seems to hinge on how right or wrong the OBR's economic forecasts are. Yet all this stuff, silly as it might all seem, is taken quite seriously by markets right now. They look at the UK, see an outlier, and tend to focus more than usual on black holes. So I'm afraid we're going to be talking about \"black holes\" for quite some time to come."

        "Content": "By Ali Fortescue, political correspondent, and Hannah Woodward, political news editor  Wales should \"learn\" from the SNP's successes in Scotland, according to the man who could well be the next first minister of Wales.  Plaid Cymru leader Rhun ap Iorwerth told Sky News: \"I believe that we will not be able to fully release our potential until we're an independent nation.\" He admitted \"not everybody agrees\" but believes there should be a discussion about how to \"edge things forwards\" on independence. The party leader has ruled out a referendum in his first term but says support for Welsh independence is growing among young voters. Mr ap Iorwerth, whose party is neck and neck with Reform UK and Labour in the polls to lead the Welsh Parliament next year, says his party takes \"very, very seriously the positive impact\" the SNP has had in Scotland. It comes as a government minister admitted there are \"major\" questions about how fairly Wales is funded compared with Scotland. Stephen Kinnock, the Labour MP for Aberafan Maesteg, told Sky News he and other Welsh MPs are looking for a reassessment of the funding formula. \n                  Adam Price: Former Plaid Cymru leader's re-election uncertain under new voting system\n                 \n                  Sir Keir Starmer apologises for being 'overly rude' to Plaid Cymru MP Liz Saville Roberts\n                 \n                  Plaid Cymru 'ready to form' next government in Wales, says leader Rhun ap Iorwerth\n                 He said the Barnett formula, which decides the allocation of much of the funding from the treasury to devolved nations, works \"much better\" for Scotland and the industrial heritage and age demographics in Wales mean the nation has been historically underserved. Read more:How Wales' Sennedd went from local authority like to fully fledged parliament in 25 years Since Mr Kinnock spoke to Sky News, Wales was awarded £5bn in revenue and capital over three years, largely for rail infrastructure, in the spending review. However, some Welsh Labour MPs fear the growing nationalist tide could mirror Scotland's 2007 shift. Lessons \"have not been learned\" from Scotland, Labour Member of the Welsh Parliament Lee Waters said. Speaking to the Labour List website, he warned: \"The control of the party machinery by London HQ, and the disdain of Westminster MPs towards their devolved counterparts were features now and then.\" Mr Waters sounded the alarm for Welsh Labour, adding: \"Scottish Labour paid the price for it in 2007. The SNP seized on its chance to form a minority government and used it to build a generation of dominance. Plaid Cymru aim to do the same.\" Political correspondent It's a question that could propel Reform UK or Plaid Cymru to power in Wales this time next year - a seismic political shift in a nation dominated by Welsh Labour since devolution began. \n The closure of the blast furnaces at Port Talbot, the end of virgin steelmaking in this country, drew comparisons with the government's intervention at Scunthorpe in Lincolnshire. Why was an English steelmaking site saved and not a Welsh one? \n The answer, as Wales MP and government minister Stephen Kinnock tells me, is not straightforward. \n The owners of Scunthorpe were \"actively sabotaging the blast furnaces\", and Labour were not in power in Westminster when decisions about Port Talbot were being made. \n \"You have to set the bar really high when you're going to, as a government, go in and seize the assets of a private company,\" he said. \n But Port Talbot has become symbolic of something bigger, and it's not just about steel. \n Last month, a new railway line between Oxford and Cambridge was classed as an England and Wales project, meaning Wales does not get a share of funding, and earlier this year Wales' first minister said the allocation of HS2 funding was \"unfair\" for Wales. \n But Welsh Labour's Eluned Morgan may not have done enough to distance herself from the national party. \n Jac Larner from Wales' Governance Centre at Cardiff University says her emphasis on the close relationship between Welsh and UK Labour echoes the message from Scottish Labour before their vote collapsed. It makes it \"easier for voters to punish both\" he said. \n Launching his party's so-called contract with voters in Merthyr Tydfil, Nigel Farage said Wales has been \"let down\". \n The Reform UK leaders' progress in Wales has been notable, but as has that of a lesser known party leader, Plaid Cymru's Rhun ap Iorwerth. \n Can Wales' nationalist party echo the SNP's success in Scotland? Both parties are fishing in the same waters for disillusioned Labour voters. Both have a real shot at power in Wales. \n Reform UK are also tapping into a mood of discontent in Wales. Leader Nigel Farage has put re-industrialisation at the centre of his pitch and even pledged to reopen Port Talbot's steel blast furnaces. In last year's general election, Reform UK came second in 13 of the 32 Welsh constituencies.  Those close to Mr Farage suggest he sees the Welsh elections next year as an important stepping stone in his ambitions to get to 10 Downing Street. Asked about Reform UK, the Plaid Cymru leader said he sees it as his \"duty\" to keep the party out of power in Wales. Mr ap Iorwerth said Mr Farage's party \"have no particular interest in developing policy for Wales\"."

The government launched its 10-year plan for the NHS on Thursday, including moving care into the community, digitising the service and focusing on prevention rather than sickness. Labour pledged in its manifesto to \"build an NHS fit for the future\", including cutting waiting times and the \"return of the family doctor\".

Core elements of his plan include a hugely enhanced NHS app to give patients more control over their care and access to more data, new neighbourhood health centres open six days a week and at least 12 hours a day, and new laws on food and alcohol to prevent ill health. He said the government had already done much to turn things around, with new staff in mental health and general practice, 170 new diagnostic services, new surgical hubs, mental health units, ambulance sites, and \"record investment right across the system\". But he added: \"I'm not going to stand here and say everything is perfect now - we have a lot more work to do, and we will do it. \"Because of the fair choices we made, the tough Labour decisions we made, the future already looks better for the NHS.\" Former Conservative health secretary and chancellor Jeremy Hunt told Sky News' Politics Hub with Sophy Ridge there is \"much to welcome\" in the plan because \"it's actually very similar to the plan that was launched in 2019 under the previous [Conservative] government by NHS England\". However, he said he has an issue with its \"execution and delivery\" as he accused the plan of failing to answer \"how you deliver this promised land\" because \"there's no extra money going into the NHS\". Mr Hunt added that it was \"a little bit unfair\" for Labour to claim the Tories were the reason the NHS is \"facing the worst crisis in its history\", pointing out COVID was \"the biggest crisis in the NHS's history\"."

        "Content": "\n          Political correspondent\n              @wizbates\n  Leaseholders will be able to more easily challenge extortionate service charges, the government has said. For those who are trapped in the midst of the leasehold scandal, the reforms cannot come soon enough. They have been promised change for many years by successive governments and by Labour in opposition, so any progress will be welcome, but is it enough for those suffering financially? It's a complex problem but at the heart of it are service charges that go higher and higher in a way that is often inexplicable, unpredictable and opaque. These are fees for building services and maintenance that are on top of the homeowner's mortgage. They often run into thousands of pounds, go way over the initial estimate and it is not clear why they are so high. By forcing companies to be transparent about the fees they are charging, the government is hoping to tackle this. \n                  'A catastrophic scandal': Inside the tower block so dangerous residents face being kicked out at any moment \n                 \n                  Hundreds face imminent eviction as Merseyside tower blocks condemned by firefighters\n                 \n                  Get building or lose your land: Labour propose strict new demands for developers\n                 The reforms, which the government has said it will push through after a consultation, will receive standardised service charge documentation which spell out clear and detailed information about how their service charges are calculated and spent. Further reforms will stop leaseholders having to automatically pay for landlords' litigation costs even where they have won their case. According to housing minister Matthew Pennycook, the changes will enable homeowners to challenge unreasonable charges more easily. He also believes it will put pressure on managing agents to bring fees down. The government will also introduce a strict new qualification regime for managing agents to try to raise standards in the sector. Read more:Labour drops pledge to abolish leasehold within 100 daysPensioner, 90, hit with £17,000 ground rent bill Mr Pennycook told Sky News: \"The system has some inherent inequities in it that do allow leaseholders to be gouged and particularly when it comes to managing agents there are unscrupulous people out there. \"They are abusing leaseholders and there's poor practice. \"The reforms we are announcing today and reforms that are to come are going to bear down managing agents and ensure the sector as a whole is properly regulated.\" Asked why it has taken a year to make this announcement, and why further changes could take much longer, he said: \"We've got to take forward through primary legislation the wider reforms necessary to bring the system to an end. \"You can't do that in 100 days but we are also determined to provide relief to existing leaseholders now.\""

        "Headline": "The government has unveiled its long-awaited plan for the NHS, promising an overhaul of the health system. But a key claim by the prime minister about a record number of NHS appointments obscures the fact that improvements are in fact slowing under Labour, Sky News has found.",
        "Content": "By Joely Santa Cruz and Daniel Dunford, data journalists  Sir Keir Starmer and his health secretary, Wes Streeting, often trumpet the number of extra NHS appointments since they took office as an example of their success, but the figures tell a different story. The prime minister today highlighted that four million additional appointments have been made in their first nine months in office - overachieving on their target of two million in a year. But Sky News and fact-checkers at Full Fact have previously shown that the number of extra appointments is slowing under Labour, and our analysis of the latest figures shows that this trend has continued. The four million extra appointments that Starmer describes is equivalent to an 8.0% rise since Labour took office. This is a smaller increase compared with the 10.6% rise under his predecessor Rishi Sunak during the same period last year, when five million additional appointments were made. The rate of increase has also slowed since Labour took office. As we reported earlier in the year, the government's original target of two million new appointments was never ambitious - and exceeding it is hardly the boast the government claims. Full Fact says the pledge \"appears very modest\", adding \"if [the government] achieved a rise of two million in its first year in office, it would be by far the smallest rise since the pandemic\". \n                  Did Keir Starmer screw up his own anniversary?\n                 \n                  MP Zarah Sultana who was ousted from Labour announces she is starting new political party with Jeremy Corbyn\n                 \n                  The PM faced down his party on welfare and lost. I suspect things may only get worse\n                 The number of appointments, currently in the region of 75 million annually across England, tends to increase every year, as the population size and level of demand rises. So, increasing the number is not remarkable itself, but whether the pace of increase can meet unmet demand and help chip away at the long treatment waiting list is what really matters. Two million extra appointments are equivalent to less than 3% of the almost 70 million carried out in the year to June 2024 - significantly lower than what has been achieved in recent years. The prime minister also seemed to suggest that the four million appointments added was a record. \"At the last election a year ago, we promised two million extra appointments in the NHS in the first year of a Labour government.\"We have now delivered four million extra appointments and that's thanks to your hard work and that of your colleagues.\"4 million. That's a record amount for a single year ever,\" he said at Thursday's press conference, addressing NHS staff. We put to the Department for Health and Social Care that this did not constitute a record, and they clarified that the prime minister was referring to the fact that the extra appointments contributed to the highest level of appointments in a single year - rather than the four million appointments being a record number of additional appointments, which would be inaccurate. Read more:Streeting admits improving GP services will be a challengeFuture looks better for NHS, says Starmer We asked the government whether the prime minister's remarks were arguably misleading, but they did not comment on this in their response. Leo Benedictus, journalist at Full Fact, said: \"While the total number of appointments may be at a record high, the actual rise in these appointments under Labour is significantly lower than it was the previous year. \"Historic data - which Full Fact had to obtain under the Freedom of Information Act - shows that while the government may hail the four million figure as a great achievement, the numbers have been rising at a similar rate for years. \"It still isn't entirely clear exactly which sorts of activity the Government is claiming is at record level, because for these appointments alone that just isn't true. \"No voter thinks improving the NHS is simple or easy, but in a time of historically low trust in politics, it is even more important that the Government is transparent and honest about their data and its significance.\" The Data and Forensics team is a multi-skilled unit dedicated to providing transparent journalism from Sky News.

        "Content": " Liverpool star Diogo Jota has died in a car crash. The 28-year-old Portuguese forward died in the accident in the early hours of Thursday morning near Zamora, in northwestern Spain. His brother, Andre Silva, was also killed in the crash on the Rias Bajas Highway (A-52) near Palacios de Sanabria, heading towards Benavente.  Follow the latest updates following Diogo Jota's death Jota and Silva were driving to Santander to catch a ferry back to England ahead of the start of Liverpool's pre-season training on Monday, CNN Portugal reports. The news outlet reports that Jota was advised against flying back to England due to recent surgery. Police said the accident happened at 12.30am when the Lamborghini the pair were travelling in veered off the road. \"A vehicle left the road and everything indicates a tyre burst while overtaking,\" the Guardia Civil in Zamora told Sky Sports News in a statement. \"As a result of the accident, the car caught fire and both people were killed. Pending the completion of forensic tests, one of the deceased has been identified as Diogo Jota, a Liverpool FC player, and his brother, Andre Felipe.\" A Spanish government source told the PA news agency that police were investigating the crash as \"a possible speeding incident\". Police added that no other vehicles were involved in the incident. Pictures of the aftermath of the crash showed debris scattered along the side of the road, including what appeared to be charred parts of the vehicle. It comes just 10 days after the player married his long-term girlfriend, Rute Cardoso. He had three children. The footballer, who played as a striker for Liverpool, began his career in his native Portugal and played at Atletico Madrid in Spain before moving to England. He joined the Merseyside club from Wolverhampton Wanderers in 2020. Jota played an important role throughout his five years with the Reds, including scoring six times in Liverpool's recent Premier League-winning season. He scored a total of 47 times in 123 matches for the club. He also played 49 times for the Portugal national side, scoring 14 times. Silva, 25, played for Penafiel, a Portuguese second division club. Teammates and football legends pay tribute A statement issued by Liverpool FC said the club was \"devastated\" by their player's death. \"The club have been informed the 28-year-old has passed away following a road traffic accident in Spain along with his brother, Andre,\" the club said in a statement. \"Liverpool FC will be making no further comment at this time and request the privacy of Diogo and Andre's family, friends, teammates and club staff is respected as they try to come to terms with an unimaginable loss. \"We will continue to provide them with our full support.\"  The Portuguese football federation said it was \"utterly devastated by the deaths\". \"Far beyond being an exceptional player, with nearly 50 caps for the national team, Diogo Jota was an extraordinary person, respected by all teammates and opponents, someone with a contagious joy and a reference within his own community. \"We have lost two champions. The passing of Diogo and Andre Silva represents irreparable losses for Portuguese Football, and we will do everything to honour their legacy daily.\" The Portugal and Spain women's teams held a minute's silence for Jota and Silva before their match in the Women's Euros in Switzerland on Thursday evening. It came after Liverpool's manager Arne Slot said in a statement: \"What can anyone say at a time like this when the shock and the pain is so incredibly raw? I wish I had the words but I know I do not. \"All I have are feelings that I know so many people will share about a person and a player we loved dearly and a family we care so much about. \"My first thoughts are not those of a football manager. They are of a father, a son, a brother and an uncle and they belong to the family of Diogo and Andre Silva who have experienced such an unimaginable loss.\" Jota's former manager at Liverpool, Jurgen Klopp, offered his thoughts in a post on Instagram. \"This is a moment where I struggle! There must be a bigger purpose, but I can't see it,\" he said. \"I'm heartbroken to hear about the passing of Diogo and his brother Andre. Diogo was not only a fantastic player, but also a great friend, a loving and caring husband and father. \"We will miss you so much. All my prayers, thoughts and power to Rute, the kids, the family, the friends and everyone who loved them.\" Liverpool captain Virgil van Dijk posted on Instagram: \"What a human being, what a player, but most importantly what an unbelievable family man. \"You mean so much to all of us and you always will!\" Cristiano Ronaldo, Jota's captain in the national team, said: \"It doesn't make sense. Just now we were together in the National Team, just now you had gotten married. \"To your family, your wife, and your children, I send my condolences and wish them all the strength in the world. \"I know you will always be with them. Rest in Peace, Diogo and Andre. We will all miss you.\"  Jota's Liverpool teammates Darwin Nunez, Cody Gakpo and Dominik Szoboszlai have also paid tribute. Szoboszlai wrote: \"Words cannot describe how heartbroken and devastated we are... Your smile, your love for the game will never be forgotten. \"We will miss you so much, but you will stay with us forever, on and off the pitch.\" Jota's former teammates Trent Alexander-Arnold, Sadio Mane, Roberto Firmino and Thiago Alcantara have also shared messages on social media. Mane posted a picture of himself and Jota with heartbreak emojis. It came as Liverpool legend Kenny Dalglish wrote on X: \"You feel helpless, knowing there's so little we can do to ease the pain for his wife of just two weeks, his three beautiful children.\" Liverpool legend Steven Gerrard shared an image of Jota on Instagram and wrote: \"Condolences to his family and friends during this incredibly sad time.\" Liverpool owners Billy Hogan, John Henry and Tom Werner, who are part of the Fenway Sports Group, said: \"This tragic situation and the reality of it is truly shocking, devastating and has left us numb with grief.\" Football icon Lionel Messi has also paid tribute, sharing an image of Jota on Instagram with the message \"QEPD\" - short for the Spanish phrase 'que en paz descanse', which translates to \"may he rest in peace'\". European football clubs such as Barcelona and AC Milan have also shared messages, along with basketball player LeBron James and tennis icon Rafael Nadal. Meanwhile Liverpool FC have opened a physical and digital book of condolence for supporters and members of the public to sign. The physical book is at the club's stadium, in the Anfield Road Stand reception area until Sunday evening. An avid video gamer, Jota also owned an eSports team and regularly streamed on Twitch."

In an interview in Iran's foreign ministry in Tehran, a senior Iranian official said despite the attacks on his country by America and Israel, back-channel efforts are under way to restart the search for a diplomatic solution. The comments will be seen as an olive branch for the Trump administration to seize as it explores a diplomatic way forward. Sky News is one of only a handful of foreign news organisations allowed access to Iran following its short and devastating war with Israel. We also filmed the impact of Israel's attacks on ordinary Iranians in Tehran. In the wake of a ceasefire declared by Donald Trump, Esmaeil Baqaei, the Iranian foreign ministry spokesman, said the US must show it is genuine in its desire for peace. \"Diplomacy must not be abused or used as a tool for deception or for simply a sort of psychological warfare against their adversaries.\"  Iran felt diplomacy had been betrayed, he said. US-Iranian talks were on the verge of reconvening when Israel attacked his country. And America had breached international law in its support of what he called \"Zionist aggression\". But Mr Baqaei said \"diplomacy never ends, there are contacts, indirectly. My minister is talking to Oman, Qatar and others\". President Trump says he is ready to talk with Iran, but major stumbling blocks need to be overcome. The US wants Iran to give up nuclear enrichment completely. Iran has long insisted it has the right to carry on. Read more from Sky News: Diogo Jota's tragic final Instagram post after marrying childhood sweetheartThousands of passengers hit by wave of flight cancellations  Across town, we witnessed the impact of Israel's attacks in Gisha, an upmarket neighbourhood of Tehran. Israel claims its attacks on Iranian figures were precision-targeted. In reality they appear to have been far from surgical. The airstrike came at 10.30 Friday morning two weeks ago. It ripped a hole through four floors of reinforced concrete in the residential apartment block. The target may have been a nuclear scientist living there, but everyone in the building is now without a home. Engineers say it will almost certainly need to be torn down. The mood in the Iranian capital seems subdued and tense. Iranians fear Israelis will renew their air campaign despite the ceasefire, but the foreign ministry spokesperson said they \"will respond\" to any Israeli attack. There is widespread resentment of the leadership after nationwide social unrest and massive economic problems. But the Israeli attacks have rallied many Iranians around their government all the same. They had hoped diplomacy with America could deliver a new deal and an end to sanctions, then Israel began its 12-day aerial onslaught and the US joined in. Iranians hope somehow talks can be restarted, but they also know the chances of progress are, for now at least, not great."

        "Content": " Israeli-backed American contractors guarding aid centres in Gaza are using live ammunition and stun grenades as starving Palestinians scramble for food, an investigation has claimed. The Associated Press has reported the accounts by two contractors from the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF), although the organisation has strongly denied the allegations, describing them as \"categorically false\". GHF was established in February to deliver desperately needed aid to people in the besieged enclave, but its work has been heavily criticised by international aid groups. It has also been subject to intense scrutiny about its operations, which Sky News previously reported are associated with a significant increase in deaths. AP's claims, which have not been independently verified by Sky News, came from GHF contractors who spoke on condition of anonymity as they were revealing their employer's internal operations. They said they were motivated to speak out as they were disturbed by what they considered dangerous practices by security staff who were often heavily armed. AP reported the contractors had claimed \"their colleagues regularly lobbed stun grenades and pepper spray in the direction of the Palestinians\" and \"bullets were fired in all directions - in the air, into the ground and at times toward the Palestinians, recalling at least one instance where he thought someone had been hit\". \n                  What's it actually like in Iran right now?\n                 \n                  94 killed in Israeli strikes in Gaza, health authorities say – as UN expert calls situation ‘apocalyptic’\n                 \n                  Benjamin Netanyahu to meet Donald Trump next week amid calls for Gaza ceasefire\n                 Contractor: 'Innocent people being hurt' \"There are innocent people being hurt.

Videos reportedly provided by one contractor show aid sites, located in Israeli military-controlled zones, with hundreds of Palestinians crammed between metal gates, scrambling to reach aid. In the background, gunfire can be heard, and stun grenades are allegedly fired into crowds. The footage does not show who was shooting or what was being shot at, but another video shows contractors in a compound, when bursts of gunfire can be heard. One man is then heard shouting in celebration: \"Whoo! Whoo!\". \"I think you hit one,\" another says, followed by the comment: \"Hell, yeah, boy!\" The contractor who took the video told AP that colleagues were shooting in the direction of Palestinians.

In response, Israel's military says it fires only warning shots and is investigating reports of civilian harm. It denies deliberately shooting at any innocent civilians and says it's examining how to reduce \"friction with the population\" in the areas surrounding the distribution centres. GHF attacks 'false claims' GHF has vehemently denied the accusations, adding that it has investigated AP's allegations. In a statement on X, GHF wrote: \"Based on time-stamped video footage and sworn witness statements, we have concluded that the claims in the AP's story are categorically false. At no point were civilians under fire at a GHF distribution site. \"The gunfire heard in the video was confirmed to have originated from the IDF, who was outside the immediate vicinity of the GHF distribution site. \"It was not directed at individuals, and no one was shot or injured. What is most troubling is that the AP refused to share the full video with us prior to publication, despite the seriousness of the allegations.\" Safe Reach Solutions, the logistics company subcontracted by GHF, told the AP there have been no serious injuries at any of their sites to date. But the organisation admitted that, in isolated incidents, security professionals fired live rounds into the ground and away from civilians to get their attention. A Safe Reach Solutions spokesperson told AP this happened at the start of their operations at \"the height of desperation where crowd control measures were necessary for the safety and security of civilians\"."

This one will likely be parked at the port permanently. The contents are suspected to be the ingredients of kush, the deadly synthetic drug ravaging Sierra Leone. Sky News was given access to the container two weeks after it was seized. \"Preliminary testing has shown that these items are kush ingredients,\" says the secretary of the Ports Authority, Martin George, as he points to the marked contraband in massive multicoloured Amazon UK bags and a large blue vat of strongly smelling acetone. He adds: \"Shipped from the United Kingdom.\" The container was selected for screening based on its origin. The UK is with the EU and South America on the list of places considered high risk for the import of illicit substances fuelling the drug trade in Sierra Leone and the region.

Nearby, 17-year-old Ibrahim is pained by growing sores and says the drug is destroying his life. \"This drug is evil. This drug is bad. I don't know why they gave me this drug in this country. Our brothers are suffering. Some are dying, some have sores on their feet. This drug brings destruction,\" he says. \"Look at me - just because of this drug. I have sores on my feet.\" Read more from Sky News:Man separated from family by war returns homeSky reporter returns to family home left in ruins Across a stream of sewage, a young mother expecting her second child cries from fear and anguish when I ask her about the risk of smoking while pregnant. \"Yes, I know the risk,\" Elizabeth says, nodding. \"I'll keep smoking while I live here but I have nowhere else to go. It helps me forget my worries and challenges.\" Life under the bridge is disrupted from its sleepiness by a yell. A plain-clothed police officer is chasing a child accused of selling kush. The lucrative industry is absorbing all age groups and spreading rapidly to nearby countries - even passing through three different borders to reach the smallest nation in mainland Africa, The Gambia.  Gambian law enforcement has cracked down on spreading kush use with regular zero tolerance drug raids. The small population is extremely vulnerable and the country is yet to open its first rehabilitation centre. Rising xenophobia seems to be mostly directed at Sierra Leonean immigrants who they blame for smuggling kush into the country. We spoke to one man from Sierra Leone who was arrested for dealing kush in The Gambia and spent a year in prison. He says that though he feels saddened other Sierra Leoneans are being alienated as a result of the trade he was involved in, he has no remorse for \"following orders\". \"Do I feel guilty for selling it? No, I don't feel guilty. I'm not using my money to buy the kush, people always give me money to get kush for them,\" he tells Sky News anonymously. \"I needed a job. I needed to take care of my son.\" Gambia's hardline approach has been credited with driving its local kush industry underground rather than eradicating it but is still hailed as the most impactful strategy in the region. Sierra Leone's government told Sky News it needs help from surrounding countries and the UK to tackle the sprawling crisis. Transnational crime experts like Lucia Bird Ruiz-Benitez de Lugo see the rise of kush as part of a global synthetic drugs network that requires a multi-national response. \"Coordinated action is urgently needed across the supply chain, particularly focused on nitazenes - the deadliest kush component,\" says Ms Bird. \"Our research indicated that kush components are being imported to West Africa from countries in Asia and Europe, likely including the UK. All countries in the supply chain bear responsibility to act to mitigate the devastating and expanding impacts of kush across West Africa, a region with scarce resources to respond.\" Yousra Elbagir has been named a winner of the International Women's Media Foundation 2025 Courage in Journalism Awards. She has chronicled the current war in Sudan, which has displaced more than 13 million people, including her own family. Recently, Elbagir led the only television news crew to document the fall of Goma - the regional capital of eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo - to M23 rebels backed by Rwanda. In the past year, her reports from the frontlines of Sudan's war have broadcast massive scenes of devastation inside a global humanitarian crisis. She said: \"Our job as journalists is to reveal the truth and inform the public. Sometimes, it's about exposing the misdeeds of the powerful. Other times, it's about capturing the scale and depth of human suffering. Our job is also getting more difficult: Information wars and contempt for legacy media is growing by the day, which makes our job even more important.\" Elbagir added: \"It is an honour to receive the IWMF Courage Award and join the ranks of such incredible women journalists. The courage to share the truth in our polarised world is at the heart of public service journalism and to be recognised for it is truly affirming - it gives me faith that people are listening.\""

        "Content": "Ryanair and easyJet have cancelled hundreds of flights as a French air traffic controllers strike looms. Ryanair, Europe's largest airline by passenger numbers, said it had axed 170 services amid a plea by French authorities for airlines to reduce flights at Paris airports by 40% on Friday. EasyJet said it was cancelling 274 flights during the action, which is due to begin later as part of a row over staffing numbers and ageing equipment. Money latest: Bond market fires warning shot at Downing St The owner of British Airways, IAG, said it was planning to use larger aircraft to minimise disruption for its own passengers. The industrial action is set to affect all flights using French airspace, leading to wider cancellations and delays across Europe and the wider world. Ryanair said its cancellations, covering both days, would hit services to and from France, and also flights over the country to destinations such as the UK, Greece, Spain and Ireland. \n                  Fiscal rules are silly but important as Reeves has banged on about them and markets care\n                 \n                  Donald Trump's 'big beautiful' tax cuts bill passes final hurdle in US Congress \n                 \n                  Ryanair to increase size of underseat free bag by 20% following EU proposals\n                 Group chief executive Michael O'Leary has campaigned for a European Union-led shake-up of air traffic control services in a bid to prevent such disruptive strikes, which have proved common in recent years. He described the latest action as \"recreational\". \"Once again, European families are held to ransom by French air traffic controllers going on strike,\" he said. \"It is not acceptable that overflights over French airspace en route to their destination are being cancelled/delayed as a result of yet another French ATC strike. \"It makes no sense and is abundantly unfair on EU passengers and families going on holidays.\" Ryanair is demanding the EU ensure that air traffic services are fully staffed for the first wave of daily departures, as well as to protect overflights during national strikes. \"These two splendid reforms would eliminate 90% of all ATC delays and cancellations, and protect EU passengers from these repeated and avoidable ATC disruptions due to yet another French ATC strike,\" Mr O'Leary added."

The blaze, which ignited near the village of Achlia, in the Ierapetra area of the Greek island's southern coast, swept across forests and farmland overnight into Thursday. Crews battled the flames with 230 firefighters and 10 aircraft dropping water from above. Read moreHow climate change is driving extreme fires in GreeceWhat the weather has in store for July Some residents were evacuated by boat, and the coast guard kept six vessels on standby for further sea rescues. Several homes were damaged as flames surged through hillside forests, fuelled by strong winds. \"It's a very difficult situation,\" said Nektarios Papadakis, a civil protection official. \"The fire is hard to contain. Right now, they cannot stop it.\" Evacuated tourists were taken to a nearby basketball arena and hotels in safer parts of the island, while mobile phone alerts were issued, urging residents to leave immediately and not return to defend their homes. As the fire approached residential areas, clouds of ash filled the sky and emergency vehicles lined roads near the resorts of Ferma and Achlia. Several people were treated for breathing problems, but no serious injuries have been reported. Wildfires are common during Greece's hot, dry summers - and the fire risk remains high across Crete and southern Greece, according to the fire service. The disaster recalls the deadly 2018 wildfire in Mati, near Athens, where more than 100 people were killed - many trapped in homes or forced into the sea to escape the flames."

        "Content": "Donald Trump's 'big beautiful bill' has been passed by the US congress, sending it to the president to sign into law. The controversial tax breaks and spending cuts package cleared its final hurdle as the Republican-controlled House of Representatives narrowly approved the bill with a 218-214 vote. The bill delivers tax breaks Mr Trump promised in his 2024 election campaign, cuts health and food safety programmes, and zeroes out dozens of green energy incentives. According to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office (CBO), it will lower tax revenues by $4.5trn over 10 years and add $3.4trn to the US's $36.2trn debt. But despite concerns over the 869-page bill's price tag - and its hit to healthcare programmes - Republicans largely lined up in support, with just two rebelling on the vote. Every Democrat in Congress voted against the bill, blasting it as a giveaway to the wealthy that will leave millions of Americans uninsured.

Speaking to reporters at Joint Base Andrews, Mr Trump hailed the package as \"the biggest bill ever signed of its kind\". \"It's going to make this country into a rocket ship,\" he added. The US president added that as he signs it into law - on the Fourth of July - fighter jets will fly over the White House. \"We'll be signing with those beautiful plans flying right over our heads,\" he said. What does the bill include?  The bill's spending cuts largely target Medicaid, the health programme that covers 71 million Americans on low incomes. It will tighten enrolment standards, institute a work requirement and clamp down on a funding mechanism used by states to boost federal payments. The changes could leave nearly 12 million people without health insurance, according to the CBO.

The bill narrowly passed the US Senate on Tuesday after vice president JD Vance cast the deciding vote to break a 50-50 tie."

In response, Mr Putin said \"Russia will not back down\" from its aims there, which include \"the elimination of the well-known root causes that led to the current state of affairs,\" Mr Ushakov said. The phrase \"root causes\" is shorthand for Moscow's argument that it was compelled to invade Ukraine in order to prevent the country from joining NATO.

In an interview in Iran's foreign ministry in Tehran, a senior Iranian official said despite the attacks on his country by America and Israel, back-channel efforts are under way to restart the search for a diplomatic solution. The comments will be seen as an olive branch for the Trump administration to seize as it explores a diplomatic way forward. Sky News is one of only a handful of foreign news organisations allowed access to Iran following its short and devastating war with Israel. We also filmed the impact of Israel's attacks on ordinary Iranians in Tehran. In the wake of a ceasefire declared by Donald Trump, Esmaeil Baqaei, the Iranian foreign ministry spokesman, said the US must show it is genuine in its desire for peace. \"Diplomacy must not be abused or used as a tool for deception or for simply a sort of psychological warfare against their adversaries.\"  Iran felt diplomacy had been betrayed, he said. US-Iranian talks were on the verge of reconvening when Israel attacked his country. And America had breached international law in its support of what he called \"Zionist aggression\". But Mr Baqaei said \"diplomacy never ends, there are contacts, indirectly. My minister is talking to Oman, Qatar and others\". President Trump says he is ready to talk with Iran, but major stumbling blocks need to be overcome. The US wants Iran to give up nuclear enrichment completely. Iran has long insisted it has the right to carry on. Read more from Sky News: Diogo Jota's tragic final Instagram post after marrying childhood sweetheartThousands of passengers hit by wave of flight cancellations  Across town, we witnessed the impact of Israel's attacks in Gisha, an upmarket neighbourhood of Tehran. Israel claims its attacks on Iranian figures were precision-targeted. In reality they appear to have been far from surgical. The airstrike came at 10.30 Friday morning two weeks ago. It ripped a hole through four floors of reinforced concrete in the residential apartment block. The target may have been a nuclear scientist living there, but everyone in the building is now without a home. Engineers say it will almost certainly need to be torn down. The mood in the Iranian capital seems subdued and tense. Iranians fear Israelis will renew their air campaign despite the ceasefire, but the foreign ministry spokesperson said they \"will respond\" to any Israeli attack. There is widespread resentment of the leadership after nationwide social unrest and massive economic problems. But the Israeli attacks have rallied many Iranians around their government all the same. They had hoped diplomacy with America could deliver a new deal and an end to sanctions, then Israel began its 12-day aerial onslaught and the US joined in. Iranians hope somehow talks can be restarted, but they also know the chances of progress are, for now at least, not great."

        "Content": "\n          Economics and data editor\n              @EdConwaySky\n  You're probably tired by now of hearing all about \"black holes\". It's one of those phrases trotted out by journalists in an effort to make economic policy sound a little more interesting. And in some senses it's a massively misleading image. After all, when people talk about fiscal holes, what they're really talking about is something rather prosaic: the amount of money it would take for the chancellor not to break her fiscal rules. Those fiscal rules are not god-given, after all. They were confected by the chancellor herself. Missing them will not really result in Britain sliding into infinite nothingness. Even so, whatever you choose to call the dilemma she's faced with right now, it's certainly quite a big deal. And understanding this helps provide a little context for the extraordinary events of the past few days, with markets sliding in the wake of Ms Reeves' teary appearance at Prime Minister's Questions. Following that moment, the yield on UK government debt - the rate of interest we're being charged by international investors - suddenly leapt higher. Granted, the jump was nothing like what we saw in the wake of Liz Truss's mini-budget. And those yields dropped down after the prime minister backed the chancellor. UK's a global outlier \n                  Donald Trump's 'big beautiful' tax cuts bill passes final hurdle in US Congress \n                 \n                  Ryanair and easyJet cancel hundreds of flights over air traffic control strike\n                 \n                  Ryanair to increase size of underseat free bag by 20% following EU proposals\n                 Even so, they underline one very important bit of context. The UK has become something of an outlier in global debt markets. For years, the yield on our benchmark government bonds was more or less middle of the industrialised-world pack. But since 2022's drama, it has hovered unnervingly high, above every other G7 nation. That speaks to a broader issue. Britain might not have the biggest deficit in the G7, or for that matter, the highest national debt. Others (most notably France, and to some extent, too, the US) face even more desperate fiscal dilemmas in the coming years. But markets do still seem nervous about Britain. Perhaps that's because of what they (and we) all endured in 2022 - when British gilt markets stepped briefly over the precipice, causing malfunctions all around the financial system (most notably in obscure parts of the pensions investment sector). But it also owes something to the fact that the chancellor's own fiscal plans are sailing worryingly close to the wind. Reeves made fiscal rules matter The main piece of evidence here is the amount of leeway she has left herself against her fiscal rules. As I said at the start, there's nothing gospel about these rules. But having created them and banged on about them for a long time, even those of us who are a little sceptical about fiscal rules would concede that breaking them is, as they say, not a good look. Back in spring, the Office for Budget Responsibility thought the chancellor had about £9.9bn in leeway against these rules. But since then, she has u-turned on both the cuts in winter fuel payments and on personal independence payments. That reduces the £9.9bn down to barely more than £3bn. Read more:Airlines cancel hundreds of flights over air traffic control strikeMore bad news for Elon Musk as Tesla deliveries miss target again But the real issue isn't just these U-turns. It's something else. The stronger the economy is, the more tax revenues come in and the more her potential headroom against the fiscal rules would be. By the same token, if the economy grows less rapidly than the OBR expected, that would mean less tax revenues and an even bigger deficit. And if you compare the OBR's latest forecasts with the current average of forecasts among independent forecasters, or for that matter, the Bank of England, they do look decidedly optimistic. If the OBR is right and everyone else is wrong, then the chancellor \"only\" has to fill in the hole left by those U-turns. But if the OBR is wrong and everyone else is right, things get considerably more grisly. Even a small downgrade in the OBR's expectations for productivity growth - say a 0.1 percentage point drop - would obliterate the remaining headroom and leave the chancellor with a £6bn shortfall against her rule. Anything more than that (and bear in mind, most economists think the OBR is out by more than that) and she could be £10bn or more underwater. Now, there are plenty of very reasonable points one could make about how silly this all is. It's silly that so many people treat fiscal rules as tablets of stone. It's silly that government tax policy from one year to the next seems to hinge on how right or wrong the OBR's economic forecasts are. Yet all this stuff, silly as it might all seem, is taken quite seriously by markets right now. They look at the UK, see an outlier, and tend to focus more than usual on black holes. So I'm afraid we're going to be talking about \"black holes\" for quite some time to come."

        "Content": "Donald Trump's 'big beautiful bill' has been passed by the US congress, sending it to the president to sign into law. The controversial tax breaks and spending cuts package cleared its final hurdle as the Republican-controlled House of Representatives narrowly approved the bill with a 218-214 vote. The bill delivers tax breaks Mr Trump promised in his 2024 election campaign, cuts health and food safety programmes, and zeroes out dozens of green energy incentives. According to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office (CBO), it will lower tax revenues by $4.5trn over 10 years and add $3.4trn to the US's $36.2trn debt. But despite concerns over the 869-page bill's price tag - and its hit to healthcare programmes - Republicans largely lined up in support, with just two rebelling on the vote. Every Democrat in Congress voted against the bill, blasting it as a giveaway to the wealthy that will leave millions of Americans uninsured. House Speaker Mike Johnson made the Republicans' closing argument for the bill, telling Congress: \"For everyday Americans, this means real, positive change that they can feel.\" \n                  Vladimir Putin tells Donald Trump he will not back down from goals in Ukraine, Kremlin says\n                 \n                  What's it actually like in Iran right now?\n                 \n                  Veteran Democrat Jack Lew expresses dismay at US deficit but blames Joe Biden too\n                 Earlier, the House's Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries gave a record-breaking eight-hour and 44-minute speech against it. \"The focus of this bill, the justification for all of the cuts that will hurt everyday Americans, is to provide massive tax breaks for billionaires,\" he said. 👉 Follow Trump100 on your podcast app 👈 Trump plans Fourth of July bill signing ceremony Mr Trump will sign the bill into law on Friday at 5pm local time (10pm in the UK), the White House said. Speaking to reporters at Joint Base Andrews, Mr Trump hailed the package as \"the biggest bill ever signed of its kind\". \"It's going to make this country into a rocket ship,\" he added. The US president added that as he signs it into law - on the Fourth of July - fighter jets will fly over the White House. \"We'll be signing with those beautiful plans flying right over our heads,\" he said. What does the bill include?  The bill's spending cuts largely target Medicaid, the health programme that covers 71 million Americans on low incomes. It will tighten enrolment standards, institute a work requirement and clamp down on a funding mechanism used by states to boost federal payments. The changes could leave nearly 12 million people without health insurance, according to the CBO.

The bill narrowly passed the US Senate on Tuesday after vice president JD Vance cast the deciding vote to break a 50-50 tie."

Ryanair, Europe's largest airline by passenger numbers, said it had axed 170 services amid a plea by French authorities for airlines to reduce flights at Paris airports by 40% on Friday. EasyJet said it was cancelling 274 flights during the action, which is due to begin later as part of a row over staffing numbers and ageing equipment.

He described the latest action as \"recreational\". \"Once again, European families are held to ransom by French air traffic controllers going on strike,\" he said. \"It is not acceptable that overflights over French airspace en route to their destination are being cancelled/delayed as a result of yet another French ATC strike. \"It makes no sense and is abundantly unfair on EU passengers and families going on holidays.\" Ryanair is demanding the EU ensure that air traffic services are fully staffed for the first wave of daily departures, as well as to protect overflights during national strikes. \"These two splendid reforms would eliminate 90% of all ATC delays and cancellations, and protect EU passengers from these repeated and avoidable ATC disruptions due to yet another French ATC strike,\" Mr O'Leary added."

        "Content": "Ryanair is increasing its underseat bag allowance by 20% after the EU set out proposed new laws for more free baggage. The budget airline currently allows people a \"personal bag\" that fits under the seat in front for free, typically a handbag or small backpack. The maximum size is going up from 40x25x20cm to 40x30x20cm. While only a 5cm increase, it means the volume will be 24 litres instead of 20 litres - which should allow space to cram in a few more T-shirts or pants. However, it still leaves Ryanair behind its main rival easyJet, which allows 45x36x20cm (32 litres), while WizzAir already allows 40x30x20cm. Ryanair said the change would be \"implemented over the coming weeks, as our airport bag sizers are adjusted\" - and would mean it's exceeding the EU's recommended minimum size. Last week, European politicians said holidaymakers should be allowed a bag with a minimum size of 40x30x15cm - and crucially another up to 100cm and 7kg in weight - without an extra fee on top of their ticket. \n                  Ryanair raises fares after profits hit by lower ticket prices\n                 \n                  Ryanair puts customers on notice of more unruly passenger lawsuits\n                 \n                  Ryanair profits nearly 10 times higher as airfares defy expectations\n                 It would be a major change as most budget airlines charge separately to put a larger bag in the overhead locker or in the hold.

The full proposals - put forward by the union's transport committee - must be voted on by the full parliament before they become law."

I'm proud of what I've delivered as chancellor.\" Asked if she was surprised that Sir Keir Starmer did not back her more strongly during PMQs, she reiterated that she and the prime minister are a \"team\", saying: \"We fought the election together, we changed the Labour Party together so that we could be in the position to return to power, and over the past year, we've worked in lockstep together.\" PM: 'I was last to appreciate' that Reeves was crying The chancellor's comments come after the prime minister told Sky News' political editor Beth Rigby that he \"didn't appreciate\" that she was crying behind him at Prime Minister's Questions yesterday because the weekly sessions are \"pretty wild\", which is why he did not offer her any support while in the chamber. He added: \"It wasn't just yesterday - no prime minister ever has had side conversations during PMQs. It does happen in other debates when there's a bit more time, but in PMQs, it is bang, bang, bang. That's what it was yesterday. \"And therefore, I was probably the last to appreciate anything else going on in the chamber, and that's just a straightforward human explanation, common sense explanation.\"  During PMQs, Tory leader Kemi Badenoch branded the chancellor the \"human shield\" for the prime minister's \"incompetence\" just hours after he was forced to perform a humiliating U-turn over his controversial welfare bill, leaving a \"black hole\" in the public finances. The prime minister's watered-down Universal Credit and Personal Independent Payment Bill was backed by a majority of 75 in a tense vote on Tuesday evening - but a total of 49 Labour MPs voted against the bill, which was the largest rebellion in a prime minister's first year in office since 47 MPs voted against Tony Blair's lone parent benefit in 1997, according to Professor Phil Cowley from Queen Mary University. Political correspondent It is a Rachel Reeves transformed that appears in front of the cameras today, nearly 24 hours since one of the most extraordinary PMQs.  Was there a hint of nervousness as she started, aware of the world watching for any signs of human emotion?  Was there a touch of feeling in her face as the crowds applauded her?  People will speculate. But Ms Reeves has got through her first public appearance, and can now, she hopes, move on.  The prime minister embraced her as he walked on stage, the health secretary talked her up: \"Thanks to her leadership, we have seen wages rising faster than the cost of living.\" A show of solidarity at the top of government, a prime minister and chancellor trying to get on with business.  But be in no doubt today's speech on a 10-year-plan for the NHS has been overshadowed. Not just by a chancellor in tears, but what that image represents.  A PM who, however assured he appeared today, has marked his first year this week, as Sky News' political editor Beth Rigby put to him, with a \"self-inflicted shambles\". She asked: \"How have you got this so wrong? How can you rebuild trust? Are you just in denial?\" They are questions Starmer will be grappling with as he tries to move past a disastrous week.   Ms Reeves has borne a lot of the criticism over the handling of the vote, with some MPs believing that her strict approach to fiscal rules has meant she has approached the ballooning welfare bill from the standpoint of trying to make savings, rather than getting people into work. Ms Badenoch also said the chancellor looked \"absolutely miserable\", and questioned whether she would remain in post until the next election. Sir Keir did not explicitly say that she will, and Ms Badenoch interjected to say: \"How awful for the chancellor that he couldn't confirm that she would stay in place.\" Downing Street scrambled to make clear to journalists that Ms Reeves was \"going nowhere\", and the prime minister has since stated publicly that she will remain as chancellor \"for many years to come\"."

        "Content": "By Martin Kimber, business producer  Conservative peer Baroness Karren Brady has told Sky News she feels \"nothing but sympathy\" for the chancellor, after Rachel Reeves was seen crying in the House of Commons during Prime Minister’s Questions. Ms Reeves was seen visibly crying in the chamber the morning after her government was forced into another U-turn on welfare reform by Labour backbenchers, all but wiping out any savings in spending she was hoping to achieve. The Prime Minister failed to back his chancellor until after PMQs, leading markets to question her future. Money latest: Has bond market calmed after chancellor's tears? The Apprentice star warned: \"She will be labelled 'weak' because it's a woman crying, the first woman chancellor, and I think that's a very dangerous thing.\" The aide to Lord Sugar, who was elevated to the upper chamber in 2014 by David Cameron, agreed with Kemi Badenoch's statement that \"the leader of the opposition called her 'a shield', which the Prime Minister is hiding behind and there's probably a bit of truth in that as well.\"  Baroness Brady, who has previously been critical of negative economic sentiment from the Labour government and tax hikes on business, said Ms Reeves is \"a strong, diligent person doing her job to the best of her ability under incredibly difficult circumstances\". Earlier this year, she told a newspaper that Reeves' hikes in business taxes \"lacks an understanding of how businesses operate\" and that last year's rise in employers' national insurance was a \"misstep\".  However, speaking at an event in the City of London, Baroness Brady expressed sympathy with the chancellor saying: \"Many people cry at work, most of them can go and hide in the toilet and not be seen. \"Being emotional is largely in part because you care very much about what you're doing and how you're doing it.\" Read more:Starmer could be ousted as PM 'within months'Reeves's tears a hard watch but reminder of her challenges However, she did maintain her differences of opinion on the administration's approach to the economy, but stated: \"She's made some pledges, that through no fault of her own, she may not be able to deliver because the floor has changed from underneath her.\" Aged 23, Baroness Brady was appointed as managing director of Birmingham City FC in 1993, and in 1997 became the youngest managing director of a UK plc, when the club floated on the London Stock Exchange."

        "Content": "\n          City editor\n              @MarkKleinmanSky\n One of Britain's biggest online travel agents (OTAs) is exploring a stock market listing - a move which could deliver a welcome boost to London's fragile pipeline for initial public offerings (IPOs). Sky News has learnt that the owner of Loveholidays is working with bankers on a flotation likely to value the company at well over £1bn. City sources said on Thursday that initial meetings with institutional investors had been scheduled, although further details of a potential listing were unclear. Money latest: Has bond market calmed after chancellor's tears? Loveholidays has been backed by Livingbridge, a private equity firm, since 2018, and has seen its financial performance improve markedly since the COVID pandemic threw the travel industry into chaos. The company specialises in trips to the Mediterranean and Canary Islands, and boasts that its inventory of 35,000 hotels and 99% of all flights result in 500 billion possible holiday packages. It reportedly saw pre-tax profits rise by a fifth to £67.6m on sales of £284m in the year to October 2024. Along with OnTheBeach and TUI, Loveholidays ranks among the UK's biggest travel agents and has been a big winner from the post-pandemic resurgence in demand from holidaymakers. Last year, Sky News reported that bidders including CVC Capital Partners, the private equity giant, were examining offers for a controlling stake in Loveholidays. When that process was curtailed, it is also said to have explored the sale of a minority stake. Loveholidays was founded in 2012 by Alex Francis and Jonny Marsh, and now employs hundreds of people. Livingbridge declined to comment."

Independent MP Zarah Sultana said she and the former Labour leader will co-lead the new party, which she did not provide a name for. She said other independent MPs, campaigners and activists from across the country will join them, but did not name anyone. Politics latest: Zarah Sultana's stinging resignation letter Ms Sultana also said she was \"resigning\" from the Labour Party after 14 years. She was suspended as a Labour MP shortly after they came to power last summer for voting against the government maintaining the two-child benefit cap. Several others from the left of the party were also suspended for voting against the government, and also remained as independent MPs. \n                  Labour MPs back Corbyn's calls for Chilcot-style inquiry into UK's role in Gaza war\n                 \n                  Starmer faces calls for UK's role in Gaza war to be scrutinised in Chilcot-style inquiry\n                 \n                  Sky News lens legend's key role in Labour history with Jeremy Corbyn\n                 Ms Sultana was still a member of the Labour Party - until now. Mr Corbyn told ITV on Wednesday that independent MPs would \"come together\" to provide an \"alternative\" party which will be about \"a society that deals with poverty, inequality and a foreign policy based on peace not war\" The other four independents are: Iqbal Mohamed, Shockat Adam, Ayoub Khan and Adnan Hussain. Mr Corbyn and the other four independents have not said if they are part of the new party Ms Sultana announced. In her announcement, Ms Sultana said she would vote to abolish the two-child benefit cap again and also voted against scrapping the winter fuel payment for most pensioners. Ms Sultana also voted against the government's welfare bill this week, which was heavily watered down as Sir Keir Starmer tried to prevent a major rebellion from his own MPs. Analysis: New party could see Starmer surrounded - if it gets off the ground  On Wednesday, Ms Sultana spoke passionately against Palestine Action being proscribed as a terror organisation - but MPs eventually voted for it to be put into law. She said to proscribe it is \"a deliberate distortion of the law to chill dissent, criminalise solidarity and suppress the truth\". The MP also shouted: \"We are all Palestine Action.\" Ms Sultana said they were founding the new party because \"Westminster is broken but the real crisis is deeper - just 50 families now own more wealth than half the UK population\". She called Reform leader Nigel Farage \"a billionaire-backed grifter\" leading the polls \"because Labour has completely failed to improve people's lives\". The MP signed the letter off with: \"In 2029, the choice will be stark: socialism or barbarism. \"Billionaires already have three parties fighting for them. It's time the rest of us had one. \"Join us. The time is now.\" Read more:Rachel Reeves says she is 'totally' up for job in first comments since tearful PMQs The MP, who has spoken passionately about Gaza, also said in her letter: \"Across the political establishment, from Farage to Starmer, they smear people of conscience trying to stop a genocide in Gaza as terrorists. \"But the truth is clear: this government is an active participant in genocide. And the British people oppose it. \"We are not going to take this anymore.\" A Labour Party spokesperson said: \"In just 12 months, this Labour government has boosted wages, delivered an extra four million NHS appointments, opened 750 free breakfast clubs, secured three trade deals and four interest rate cuts lowering mortgage payments for millions. \"Only Labour can deliver the change needed to renew Britain.\""

I'm proud of what I've delivered as chancellor.\" Asked if she was surprised that Sir Keir Starmer did not back her more strongly during PMQs, she reiterated that she and the prime minister are a \"team\", saying: \"We fought the election together, we changed the Labour Party together so that we could be in the position to return to power, and over the past year, we've worked in lockstep together.\" PM: 'I was last to appreciate' that Reeves was crying The chancellor's comments come after the prime minister told Sky News' political editor Beth Rigby that he \"didn't appreciate\" that she was crying behind him at Prime Minister's Questions yesterday because the weekly sessions are \"pretty wild\", which is why he did not offer her any support while in the chamber. He added: \"It wasn't just yesterday - no prime minister ever has had side conversations during PMQs. It does happen in other debates when there's a bit more time, but in PMQs, it is bang, bang, bang. That's what it was yesterday. \"And therefore, I was probably the last to appreciate anything else going on in the chamber, and that's just a straightforward human explanation, common sense explanation.\"  During PMQs, Tory leader Kemi Badenoch branded the chancellor the \"human shield\" for the prime minister's \"incompetence\" just hours after he was forced to perform a humiliating U-turn over his controversial welfare bill, leaving a \"black hole\" in the public finances. The prime minister's watered-down Universal Credit and Personal Independent Payment Bill was backed by a majority of 75 in a tense vote on Tuesday evening - but a total of 49 Labour MPs voted against the bill, which was the largest rebellion in a prime minister's first year in office since 47 MPs voted against Tony Blair's lone parent benefit in 1997, according to Professor Phil Cowley from Queen Mary University. Political correspondent It is a Rachel Reeves transformed that appears in front of the cameras today, nearly 24 hours since one of the most extraordinary PMQs.  Was there a hint of nervousness as she started, aware of the world watching for any signs of human emotion?  Was there a touch of feeling in her face as the crowds applauded her?  People will speculate. But Ms Reeves has got through her first public appearance, and can now, she hopes, move on.  The prime minister embraced her as he walked on stage, the health secretary talked her up: \"Thanks to her leadership, we have seen wages rising faster than the cost of living.\" A show of solidarity at the top of government, a prime minister and chancellor trying to get on with business.  But be in no doubt today's speech on a 10-year-plan for the NHS has been overshadowed. Not just by a chancellor in tears, but what that image represents.  A PM who, however assured he appeared today, has marked his first year this week, as Sky News' political editor Beth Rigby put to him, with a \"self-inflicted shambles\". She asked: \"How have you got this so wrong? How can you rebuild trust? Are you just in denial?\" They are questions Starmer will be grappling with as he tries to move past a disastrous week.   Ms Reeves has borne a lot of the criticism over the handling of the vote, with some MPs believing that her strict approach to fiscal rules has meant she has approached the ballooning welfare bill from the standpoint of trying to make savings, rather than getting people into work. Ms Badenoch also said the chancellor looked \"absolutely miserable\", and questioned whether she would remain in post until the next election. Sir Keir did not explicitly say that she will, and Ms Badenoch interjected to say: \"How awful for the chancellor that he couldn't confirm that she would stay in place.\" Downing Street scrambled to make clear to journalists that Ms Reeves was \"going nowhere\", and the prime minister has since stated publicly that she will remain as chancellor \"for many years to come\"."

For those who are trapped in the midst of the leasehold scandal, the reforms cannot come soon enough. They have been promised change for many years by successive governments and by Labour in opposition, so any progress will be welcome, but is it enough for those suffering financially? It's a complex problem but at the heart of it are service charges that go higher and higher in a way that is often inexplicable, unpredictable and opaque. These are fees for building services and maintenance that are on top of the homeowner's mortgage. They often run into thousands of pounds, go way over the initial estimate and it is not clear why they are so high. By forcing companies to be transparent about the fees they are charging, the government is hoping to tackle this. \n                  'A catastrophic scandal': Inside the tower block so dangerous residents face being kicked out at any moment \n                 \n                  Hundreds face imminent eviction as Merseyside tower blocks condemned by firefighters\n                 \n                  Get building or lose your land: Labour propose strict new demands for developers\n                 The reforms, which the government has said it will push through after a consultation, will receive standardised service charge documentation which spell out clear and detailed information about how their service charges are calculated and spent. Further reforms will stop leaseholders having to automatically pay for landlords' litigation costs even where they have won their case. According to housing minister Matthew Pennycook, the changes will enable homeowners to challenge unreasonable charges more easily. He also believes it will put pressure on managing agents to bring fees down. The government will also introduce a strict new qualification regime for managing agents to try to raise standards in the sector. Read more:Labour drops pledge to abolish leasehold within 100 daysPensioner, 90, hit with £17,000 ground rent bill Mr Pennycook told Sky News: \"The system has some inherent inequities in it that do allow leaseholders to be gouged and particularly when it comes to managing agents there are unscrupulous people out there. \"They are abusing leaseholders and there's poor practice. \"The reforms we are announcing today and reforms that are to come are going to bear down managing agents and ensure the sector as a whole is properly regulated.\" Asked why it has taken a year to make this announcement, and why further changes could take much longer, he said: \"We've got to take forward through primary legislation the wider reforms necessary to bring the system to an end. \"You can't do that in 100 days but we are also determined to provide relief to existing leaseholders now.\""

Speaking to Sky News political editor Beth Rigby on the Electoral Dysfunction podcast, Baroness Harman said the prime minister can use his deputy in two ways after she successfully led the effort behind the scenes to save the government's welfare bill from being defeated in the Commons by rebel Labour MPs. \"There's two ways he could respond to the situation about Angela Rayner,\" she said. \"One is to feel defensive about it and that is somehow undermining his power. \"He's got to find ways to sort of fence her in or to actually recognise that she's a great communicator, that she's popular, people like her, and actually he needs to pull her into his leadership and use her for what she can actually bring in. \"The way that Tony Blair used John Prescott to actually augment his premiership.\" Despite the many U-turns the government was forced into over the welfare bill, it would ultimately have been worse if a Labour rebellion defeated the bill entirely on Tuesday.

But that's now where the narrative is. \"So, the job has got much more difficult. But it's a job they've got to do.\" The original welfare bill reforms, including narrowing eligibility for the main disability benefit, were meant to save the government £5.5bn but the Institute for Fiscal Studies said the U-turns now mean they will cost the taxpayer. This has prompted questions about Chancellor Rachel Reeves's job security, but Baroness Harman backed Ms Reeves and said she is \"the solution to the problem\"."

        "Content": "By Ali Fortescue, political correspondent, and Hannah Woodward, political news editor  Wales should \"learn\" from the SNP's successes in Scotland, according to the man who could well be the next first minister of Wales.  Plaid Cymru leader Rhun ap Iorwerth told Sky News: \"I believe that we will not be able to fully release our potential until we're an independent nation.\" He admitted \"not everybody agrees\" but believes there should be a discussion about how to \"edge things forwards\" on independence. The party leader has ruled out a referendum in his first term but says support for Welsh independence is growing among young voters. Mr ap Iorwerth, whose party is neck and neck with Reform UK and Labour in the polls to lead the Welsh Parliament next year, says his party takes \"very, very seriously the positive impact\" the SNP has had in Scotland. It comes as a government minister admitted there are \"major\" questions about how fairly Wales is funded compared with Scotland. Stephen Kinnock, the Labour MP for Aberafan Maesteg, told Sky News he and other Welsh MPs are looking for a reassessment of the funding formula. \n                  Adam Price: Former Plaid Cymru leader's re-election uncertain under new voting system\n                 \n                  Sir Keir Starmer apologises for being 'overly rude' to Plaid Cymru MP Liz Saville Roberts\n                 \n                  Plaid Cymru 'ready to form' next government in Wales, says leader Rhun ap Iorwerth\n                 He said the Barnett formula, which decides the allocation of much of the funding from the treasury to devolved nations, works \"much better\" for Scotland and the industrial heritage and age demographics in Wales mean the nation has been historically underserved. Read more:How Wales' Sennedd went from local authority like to fully fledged parliament in 25 years Since Mr Kinnock spoke to Sky News, Wales was awarded £5bn in revenue and capital over three years, largely for rail infrastructure, in the spending review. However, some Welsh Labour MPs fear the growing nationalist tide could mirror Scotland's 2007 shift. Lessons \"have not been learned\" from Scotland, Labour Member of the Welsh Parliament Lee Waters said. Speaking to the Labour List website, he warned: \"The control of the party machinery by London HQ, and the disdain of Westminster MPs towards their devolved counterparts were features now and then.\" Mr Waters sounded the alarm for Welsh Labour, adding: \"Scottish Labour paid the price for it in 2007. The SNP seized on its chance to form a minority government and used it to build a generation of dominance. Plaid Cymru aim to do the same.\" Political correspondent It's a question that could propel Reform UK or Plaid Cymru to power in Wales this time next year - a seismic political shift in a nation dominated by Welsh Labour since devolution began. \n The closure of the blast furnaces at Port Talbot, the end of virgin steelmaking in this country, drew comparisons with the government's intervention at Scunthorpe in Lincolnshire. Why was an English steelmaking site saved and not a Welsh one? \n The answer, as Wales MP and government minister Stephen Kinnock tells me, is not straightforward. \n The owners of Scunthorpe were \"actively sabotaging the blast furnaces\", and Labour were not in power in Westminster when decisions about Port Talbot were being made. \n \"You have to set the bar really high when you're going to, as a government, go in and seize the assets of a private company,\" he said. \n But Port Talbot has become symbolic of something bigger, and it's not just about steel. \n Last month, a new railway line between Oxford and Cambridge was classed as an England and Wales project, meaning Wales does not get a share of funding, and earlier this year Wales' first minister said the allocation of HS2 funding was \"unfair\" for Wales. \n But Welsh Labour's Eluned Morgan may not have done enough to distance herself from the national party. \n Jac Larner from Wales' Governance Centre at Cardiff University says her emphasis on the close relationship between Welsh and UK Labour echoes the message from Scottish Labour before their vote collapsed. It makes it \"easier for voters to punish both\" he said. \n Launching his party's so-called contract with voters in Merthyr Tydfil, Nigel Farage said Wales has been \"let down\". \n The Reform UK leaders' progress in Wales has been notable, but as has that of a lesser known party leader, Plaid Cymru's Rhun ap Iorwerth. \n Can Wales' nationalist party echo the SNP's success in Scotland? Both parties are fishing in the same waters for disillusioned Labour voters. Both have a real shot at power in Wales. \n Reform UK are also tapping into a mood of discontent in Wales. Leader Nigel Farage has put re-industrialisation at the centre of his pitch and even pledged to reopen Port Talbot's steel blast furnaces. In last year's general election, Reform UK came second in 13 of the 32 Welsh constituencies.  Those close to Mr Farage suggest he sees the Welsh elections next year as an important stepping stone in his ambitions to get to 10 Downing Street. Asked about Reform UK, the Plaid Cymru leader said he sees it as his \"duty\" to keep the party out of power in Wales. Mr ap Iorwerth said Mr Farage's party \"have no particular interest in developing policy for Wales\"."

The aim is to shift care away from under-pressure medical facilities and closer to people's homes, while taking measures to prevent people needing treatment in the first place. Politics latest: It's a mess within Downing Street Core elements of his plan include a hugely enhanced NHS app to give patients more control over their care and access to more data, new neighbourhood health centres open six days a week and at least 12 hours a day, and new laws on food and alcohol to prevent ill health. Sir Keir said before the general election a year ago there were record waiting lists for treatment, patient satisfaction was at the lowest level ever, and thousands have been forced to wait more than six hours in A&E, despite the efforts of NHS staff. He argued that the government had already done much to start turning things around, pointing to new NHS staff recruited in mental health and general practice, 170 diagnostic centres now open, new surgical hubs, mental health units, ambulance sites, and \"record investment right across the system\". \n                  Wes Streeting admits improving GP services will be a challenge but is one he will 'take on the chin'\n                 \n                  Growth in NHS appointments continues to slow under Labour despite Starmer's claims of success\n                 \n                  Wes Streeting defends chancellor and PM ahead of 'seismic' 10-year plan for NHS\n                 But he added: \"I'm not going to stand here and say everything is perfect now - we have a lot more work to do, and we will do it. \"Because of the fair choices we made, the tough Labour decisions we made, the future already looks better for the NHS.\"  Starmer praises Reeves after tearful PMQs The prime minister was accompanied by Chancellor Rachel Reeves, who was making her first public appearance since she was seen crying during Prime Minister's Questions. He would not say why she had been upset, telling journalists that it was a \"personal matter\", and praised her work as chancellor, saying the investment the government is making in the NHS is \"all down to the foundation we laid this year, all down to the path of renewal that we chose, the decisions made by the chancellor, by Rachel Reeves\".  Ms Reeves also spoke at the event, saying: \"I want to be clear, we are spending money on taxpayers' priorities, but that wouldn't have been possible without the measures that we took in the budget last year. \"We fixed the foundations and we've put our economy back on a strong footing.\" The 10-year plan set out a series of measures to move the NHS from analogue systems to new digital ones, move from treatment to prevention, and deliver more healthcare in the community, with the aim of ending the \"status quo of hospital by default\". There will be new neighbourhood health to give people access to a full range of services, leaving hospitals to focus on the sickest, and advice on debt, employment, stopping smoking, and obesity will also be available.  Core elements of the plan include: • Making the NHS app \"a full front door to the entire NHS\" by 2028 to help patients access the full range of services available; • A single patient record and personalised information to stop patients having to repeat details of their health issue; • An expansion of wearable technology to make it the \"standard in preventative, chronic and post-acute NHS treatment by 2035\"; • 85 new mental health emergency departments so people do not end up in A&E • New restrictions on the junk food advertising targeted at children, a ban on the sale of high-caffeine energy drinks to under 16-year-olds, reforms to the soft drinks industry levy, and a new \"mandatory requirement for alcoholic drinks to display consistent nutritional information and health warning messages\"; • Forcing dentists to work for the NHS for at least three years if they have been trained at taxpayers' expense; • An end to the \"disgraceful spectacle of corridor care\" and ensuring 95% of people wait no longer than 18 weeks for routine care; • Priority to be given to UK medical graduates and an ambition to reduce international recruitment to less than 10% by 2035. Plan 'still sketchy on detail' The plan has been cautiously welcomed by trade unions and the broader health industry, but there has been criticism that the plan lacks detail. Sarah Woolnough, chief executive of the King's Fund, said: \"There are more than 150 pages of a vision of how things could be different in the NHS by 2035, but nowhere near enough detail about how it will be implemented.\" Royal College of Nursing (RCN) general secretary, Professor Nicola Ranger, said: \"Nursing staff are crying out for change and we stand ready to get behind this plan. \"Modernising services, bringing care closer to home and helping people to lead healthier lives couldn't be more necessary... \"Nursing staff are identified today as the expert leaders to deliver a neighbourhood health service and that should be truly empowering. As the professionals delivering the vast majority of care, we know what keeps patients safe and well.\" Read more:Reeves says she is 'totally' up for the job of chancellorEmotional Reeves a painful watch - and a reminder of tough decisions aheadStarmer 'could be ousted as PM within months' The Conservative shadow health secretary said the government's \"long-term goals are right\", but warned that the plans is \"still sketchy on some of the details of delivery\". Edward Argar told the Commons: \"It is ambitious, I believe his long-term goals are right and that the reforms he sets out today build on the reforms we set out and carried out. The desire to shift care from hospital to community, to better use technology and to move to prevention are not new at all, but they remain vital.\""

        "Headline": "The government has unveiled its long-awaited plan for the NHS, promising an overhaul of the health system. But a key claim by the prime minister about a record number of NHS appointments obscures the fact that improvements are in fact slowing under Labour, Sky News has found.",
        "Content": "By Joely Santa Cruz and Daniel Dunford, data journalists  Sir Keir Starmer and his health secretary, Wes Streeting, often trumpet the number of extra NHS appointments since they took office as an example of their success, but the figures tell a different story. The prime minister today highlighted that four million additional appointments have been made in their first nine months in office - overachieving on their target of two million in a year. But Sky News and fact-checkers at Full Fact have previously shown that the number of extra appointments is slowing under Labour, and our analysis of the latest figures shows that this trend has continued. The four million extra appointments that Starmer describes is equivalent to an 8.0% rise since Labour took office. This is a smaller increase compared with the 10.6% rise under his predecessor Rishi Sunak during the same period last year, when five million additional appointments were made. The rate of increase has also slowed since Labour took office. As we reported earlier in the year, the government's original target of two million new appointments was never ambitious - and exceeding it is hardly the boast the government claims. Full Fact says the pledge \"appears very modest\", adding \"if [the government] achieved a rise of two million in its first year in office, it would be by far the smallest rise since the pandemic\". \n                  Did Keir Starmer screw up his own anniversary?\n                 \n                  MP Zarah Sultana who was ousted from Labour announces she is starting new political party with Jeremy Corbyn\n                 \n                  The PM faced down his party on welfare and lost. I suspect things may only get worse\n                 The number of appointments, currently in the region of 75 million annually across England, tends to increase every year, as the population size and level of demand rises. So, increasing the number is not remarkable itself, but whether the pace of increase can meet unmet demand and help chip away at the long treatment waiting list is what really matters. Two million extra appointments are equivalent to less than 3% of the almost 70 million carried out in the year to June 2024 - significantly lower than what has been achieved in recent years. The prime minister also seemed to suggest that the four million appointments added was a record. \"At the last election a year ago, we promised two million extra appointments in the NHS in the first year of a Labour government.\"We have now delivered four million extra appointments and that's thanks to your hard work and that of your colleagues.\"4 million. That's a record amount for a single year ever,\" he said at Thursday's press conference, addressing NHS staff. We put to the Department for Health and Social Care that this did not constitute a record, and they clarified that the prime minister was referring to the fact that the extra appointments contributed to the highest level of appointments in a single year - rather than the four million appointments being a record number of additional appointments, which would be inaccurate. Read more:Streeting admits improving GP services will be a challengeFuture looks better for NHS, says Starmer We asked the government whether the prime minister's remarks were arguably misleading, but they did not comment on this in their response. Leo Benedictus, journalist at Full Fact, said: \"While the total number of appointments may be at a record high, the actual rise in these appointments under Labour is significantly lower than it was the previous year. \"Historic data - which Full Fact had to obtain under the Freedom of Information Act - shows that while the government may hail the four million figure as a great achievement, the numbers have been rising at a similar rate for years. \"It still isn't entirely clear exactly which sorts of activity the Government is claiming is at record level, because for these appointments alone that just isn't true. \"No voter thinks improving the NHS is simple or easy, but in a time of historically low trust in politics, it is even more important that the Government is transparent and honest about their data and its significance.\" The Data and Forensics team is a multi-skilled unit dedicated to providing transparent journalism from Sky News.

The government launched its 10-year plan for the NHS on Thursday, including moving care into the community, digitising the service and focusing on prevention rather than sickness. Labour pledged in its manifesto to \"build an NHS fit for the future\", including cutting waiting times and the \"return of the family doctor\". But since coming to power last July, 62 GP surgeries have closed, and 5.8 million people a month waited more than 14 days to see a GP compared with 5.4 million in the same period last year. Health Secretary Wes Streeting told Sky News health correspondent Ashish Joshi: \"I take your challenge on the chin about trying to stop practices from closing, trying to stop GPs leaving the profession and to make sure people have an improving experience in general practice. \"That's why neighbourhood health is such a big part of the plan. \"When I'm reporting back on progress, whether on GPs recruited or the fact NHS waiting lists are the lowest levels in two years, it's not because I think jobs done, I'm not trying to do victory laps or overclaim what we've managed to do. \n                  Sir Keir Starmer unveils 10-year plan for the NHS and declares: 'The future already looks better'\n                 \n                  Growth in NHS appointments continues to slow under Labour despite Starmer's claims of success\n                 \n                  Wes Streeting defends chancellor and PM ahead of 'seismic' 10-year plan for NHS\n                 \"It's more to report back to a sceptical public that actually, we are moving finally in the right direction. \"But I don't doubt for a moment there is more to do and I take that challenge really seriously because we can't succeed without GPs and the NHS will not survive and thrive without bringing back that family doctor relationship.\" Read more:Starmer unveils 10-year NHS planStarmer put on notice and may have to step down within months  Earlier, Sir Keir Starmer said the 10-year plan's aim is to shift care away from under-pressure medical facilities and closer to people's homes, while taking measures to prevent people needing treatment in the first place.

However, he said he has an issue with its \"execution and delivery\" as he accused the plan of failing to answer \"how you deliver this promised land\" because \"there's no extra money going into the NHS\". Mr Hunt added that it was \"a little bit unfair\" for Labour to claim the Tories were the reason the NHS is \"facing the worst crisis in its history\", pointing out COVID was \"the biggest crisis in the NHS's history\"."

The blaze, which ignited near the village of Achlia, in the Ierapetra area of the Greek island's southern coast, swept across forests and farmland overnight into Thursday. Crews battled the flames with 230 firefighters and 10 aircraft dropping water from above. Read moreHow climate change is driving extreme fires in GreeceWhat the weather has in store for July Some residents were evacuated by boat, and the coast guard kept six vessels on standby for further sea rescues.

Right now, they cannot stop it.\" Evacuated tourists were taken to a nearby basketball arena and hotels in safer parts of the island, while mobile phone alerts were issued, urging residents to leave immediately and not return to defend their homes. As the fire approached residential areas, clouds of ash filled the sky and emergency vehicles lined roads near the resorts of Ferma and Achlia. Several people were treated for breathing problems, but no serious injuries have been reported. Wildfires are common during Greece's hot, dry summers - and the fire risk remains high across Crete and southern Greece, according to the fire service. The disaster recalls the deadly 2018 wildfire in Mati, near Athens, where more than 100 people were killed - many trapped in homes or forced into the sea to escape the flames."

After a slew of criticism over the last week, some of which suggested Mr Davie should resign, the BBC said music performances it deems high risk won't be broadcast or streamed live any more. Editorial policy support will also be available on site at major events, while more \"detailed, practical\" guidance will be given on when to take down a live feed. The BBC also suggested action could be taken against staff who failed to pull the plug on Bob Vylan. \"Given the failings that have been acknowledged we are taking actions to ensure proper accountability for those found to be responsible for those failings in the live broadcast,\" said the statement. The broadcaster apologised to the Jewish community and said it deeply regretted \"such offensive and deplorable behaviour appeared on the BBC\". \"We are also unequivocal that there can be no place for antisemitism at, or on, the BBC,\" it added. Arts and entertainment correspondent It's a festival full of wonder, but this year's Glastonbury left some people curious for brand new reasons. It just didn't seem to make sense that the BBC would broadcast Bob Vylan live when there had been so much heat around Kneecap's performance.  A quick glance at Bob Vylan's recordings and track record shows they are a hard left, outspoken band whose music is a robust, and at times expletive-laden, social and political commentary about modern Britain, race, capitalism and global politics – which their fans love. They're punks. To quote their lyrics they're \"no pacifist\", they're \"smashing fists\". The BBC Music teams are highly knowledgeable and - as a sea of pro-Palestinian flags amassed in front of the stage - it's hard to fathom why nobody pointed out the high-speed train coming towards them.   But Thursday's statement shows that in fact, the BBC were aware of this, that Bob Vylan were categorised as \"high risk\". It begs the question – why supress Kneecap live but not Bob Vylan? The statement moves to answer that question - and now sets up a harder system. From now on all  \"high risk\" acts will be deemed unsuitable for live streaming – a seemingly simple solution. But there will be some who don't think it's the right one. For generations, the BBC's music output, especially in its more obscure, late-night recesses, has had a place for music with a political edge.   The toxicity and divisiveness of the Middle East conflict has now placed new limits on that.\n\n Culture Secretary Lisa Nandy said on Thursday that the BBC's reply to her questions about the incident were not good enough and she had asked for more information. Bob Vylan said on Instagram that they are \"not for the death of Jews, Arabs or any other race or group of people\", but instead support \"dismantling of a violent military machine... A machine that has destroyed much of Gaza.\" They said they were a \"distraction from the story\" and whatever \"sanctions\" they receive would also be a distraction. \"We are being targeted for speaking up, we are not the first, we will not be the last,\" they added.

See below for a full list of tour dates: \n                  Gareth Bale interested in buying hometown club Cardiff City\n                 \n                  Former Tory MP admits harassing ex-wife\n                 \n                  Dementia: Sleep problems could 'double risk' of disease in later life\n                 Why was Cardiff picked as the first stop? Asked on X in May why Cardiff was chosen as the location for the opening leg, Liam Gallagher said \"because Cardiff is the bollox\". Principality Stadium is a 74,500-seat venue, known as the home of Welsh rugby, which played host to Bruce Springsteen and Taylor Swift concerts last year. Businesses in the area are hoping the arrival of Oasis will bring an influx of trade to the city. Gary Corp, manager of the City Arms, told Sky News that he was expecting the concert would \"treble if not quadruple the footfall on the street\". Meanwhile, Ethan John, events manager at Tiny Rebel, said Oasis choosing Cardiff to kick off their tour was \"surreal\" and that previous events such as Taylor Swift's Eras Tour had a \"massive impact\" on footfall. What travel advice is there in Cardiff? Train operators say trains will be busy and people should allow plenty of time for their journey home. Georgie Wills, from Transport for Wales, said the company was \"thrilled to welcome thousands to Cardiff this summer\". \"Look out for our queuing systems and travel tips - and let's make it a safe and smooth experience for everyone,\" she added. Cardiff Council has confirmed that roads around the stadium will close from 12pm until 12am on both Friday and Saturday. The road closures come into force three hours earlier than is planned for upcoming Stereophonics, Kendrick Lamar and Catfish and the Bottlemen concerts later this summer. The Cardiff Bus Interchange will close at 3pm and Cardiff Queen Street railway station will close at 10pm (apart from accessible travel or journeys to Cardiff Bay). What time does the show start and who are the support acts? Principality Stadium's doors open at 5pm on both Friday and Saturday. The band will be supported by indie rock band Cast and Richard Ashcroft (who formed alternative rock band the Verve) in Cardiff, Manchester, London, Edinburgh and Dublin. Cast start their Cardiff set at 6pm, followed by Richard Ashcroft at 7pm. Oasis will take to the stage at 8.15pm, and should finish by 10.30pm. American rock band Cage the Elephant will support Oasis in Canada, Mexico and at the Chicago gig. They will be joined again by Cast for the East Rutherford and Pasadena dates. Australian indie rock band Ball Park Music will support in Australia. Are tickets still available for the shows? The tour is sold out, but the band has said it is possible some additional tickets may be released. In an Instagram post on 25 June, the band advised members of Oasismynet to \"keep an eye\" on their inbox. The final releases would come \"over the coming days\" once production was \"fine tuned\", the band said.
