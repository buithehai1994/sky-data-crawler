        "Content": "Donald Trump says the Gaza ceasefire should be cancelled if all remaining Israeli hostages are not returned by noon on Saturday - as he warned Hamas that \"all hell is going to break out\". The US president's intervention came hours after Hamas has said it will delay the release of more hostages and accused Israel of violating their ceasefire deal. While signing a series of new executive orders, Mr Trump said he feared many Israeli hostages scheduled for release are already dead. Referring to his Saturday deadline for the release of hostages, Mr Trump said: \"If they're not here, all hell is going to break out.\" He acknowledged that a decision to end the ceasefire was up to Israel, adding: \"I'm speaking for myself. Israel can override it.\" Hours earlier, Mr Trump said Palestinians would not have the right to return under his plan for US \"ownership\" of Gaza - contradicting officials in his administration who said they would be relocated temporarily. Trump latest: 'Palestinians will have no right to Gaza return' \n                  Trump says Palestinians couldn't return to Gaza under his redevelopment plan\n                 \n                  Trump says Israel-Hamas ceasefire should be cancelled unless all hostages are returned on Saturday\n                 \n                  Donald Trump: The world can't get through a day without noticing him or feeling his impact\n                 Hamas halts release of hostages Earlier on Monday, Hamas claimed ceasefire violations had included \"delaying the return of the displaced to the northern Gaza Strip, and targeting them with shelling and gunfire\". Spokesman Abu Obeida said Hamas remained committed if Israel kept to the terms, but that the 15 February handover was postponed \"until the occupation commits to and compensates for the past weeks\". Egyptian security sources told Reuters that mediators now fear the deal will break down. They said Hamas believes Israel isn't serious about the ceasefire - which began on 19 January. The last hostage release took place at the weekend and saw three Israeli men set free. Five Thai citizens released last month were also finally reunited with their families in Bangkok. They were among about 250 people taken during the 7 October 2023 attack, when 1,200 people were murdered.  Five swaps have taken place so far, with 21 hostages and more than 730 Palestinian prisoners released. Saturday's exchange was due to involve three more Israelis and hundreds of Palestinians. Defence minister Israel Katz said any delay in releasing hostages would be \"a complete violation\" and he had instructed troops to be on highest alert. The Hostages and Missing Family Forum called on mediating countries to restore the deal, saying \"time is of the essence\" and citing \"the shocking conditions of the hostages released last Saturday\". Read more:Trump plan so outrageous it might be part of something bigger Israeli police confiscate books in raid on Palestinian bookshops As part of the ceasefire deal, Israeli forces pulled back from a key passage through Gaza on Sunday. The four-mile-long Netzarim corridor separates northern Gaza from the south, and hundreds of thousands of displaced Palestinians have now crossed back over. However, Israel pushed back the withdrawal by a few days in protest at the chaotic release of hostages Arbel Yehud and Gadi Moses. This may be what Hamas is referencing what it talks of \"delaying the return of the displaced\".  There have also been examples of Israeli troops shooting at or near Palestinians approaching Israeli forces after being warned to stay back. So far, little progress has been made on an extension to the first six-week phase of the ceasefire. A delegation from Israel has arrived in Qatar for further talks amid concern the deal might collapse before all remaining hostages are freed. Israel has previously said it will not agree to a complete withdrawal from Gaza until Hamas's military and political capabilities are eliminated. Hamas has countered that it will not hand over the final hostages until Israel removes all its troops from Gaza."

        "Headline": "Under changes to a proposed bill, expert panels could now approve assisted dying requests rather than High Court judges.",
        "Content": " Assisted dying cases would not need to be signed off by a High Court judge, the MP behind a new bill has proposed. Labour MP Kim Leadbeater is expected to bring forward amendments to her proposal so a multi-disciplinary panel of experts will examine cases and have the power to grant permission for assisted death. Three-member panels would be chaired by a retired High Court judge, King's Counsel or a person with similar qualifications - and their decisions could \"if required\" be reviewed by the High Court. In the initial version of the Terminally Ill Adults (End of Life) Bill, which was backed by MPs in November, a High Court judge would have to approve requests for assistance after assent from two doctors. Ms Leadbeater has described the amended plan as a \"judge plus\" system, arguing that it strengthens safeguards against pressure or coercion as it gives an \"enhanced role for professionals such as psychiatrists and social workers\". However assisted dying critics say safeguards have been watered down, with Tory minister Danny Kruger calling the change \"a disgrace\". Labour MP Diane Abbott said the bill was \"rushed, badly thought out legislation\" which \"needs to be voted down\", while former Lib Dem leader Tim Farron said \"even the weak safeguards that existed are being dropped\". \n                  Doctors should be able to opt out of recommending assisted dying, MPs told\n                 \n                  Questions over assisted dying\n                 \n                  Cost of assisted dying 'could be tens of thousands of pounds' per person\n                  The proposal will be voted on by a committee of MPs who will begin going through the bill line by line on Tuesday. The committee, selected by Ms Leadbeater, has a 14-9 majority in favour of assisted dying based on November's vote. 'There's a role for other experts to play' In an interview with Sophy Ridge on Sky's Politics Hub, filmed on Monday afternoon, Ms Leadbeater was challenged about whether a High Court judge would be specifically required in all cases. \"I think there's a role for other experts to play,\" she said and referred to expert evidence politicians have been hearing about the Terminally Ill Adults (End of Life) Bill. \"I think what came through in the evidence was the need for a multidisciplinary approach. That's something I'm giving serious consideration to.  \"I think the legal oversight is really important, but I think that multidisciplinary approach could actually enhance the bill even further,\" she added. Read more from Sky News:Parliamentary bar re-opens after spiking claimFarage claims Labour MPs will be 'getting scared'  The new proposals would also involve the creation of a Voluntary Assisted Dying Commission to oversee all applications, chaired by a High Court judge or senior former judge. Cases would be referred to multi-disciplinary panels which can grant approval. The panel is tasked with ensuring people have the capacity to make the decision without pressure or coercion. The bill also requires two independent doctors to submit reports on each person applying for permission to die. In January, learning disability charity Mencap warned that discussions around the option of assisted dying might risk pushing \"people in a course that they don't, they may not want to go down\"."

        "Content": " A father has been sentenced to life in prison with a minimum term of 15 years for the murder of his 14-year-old daughter. Simon Vickers was found guilty last month of killing his daughter Scarlett Vickers after stabbing her in the heart at their home in Darlington, County Durham, in July 2024. The 50-year-old, who denied charges of manslaughter and murder, gave different accounts of what happened in the seconds before he plunged a kitchen knife 11cm into her chest. As it happened: Simon Vickers sentencing Scarlett's mother, Sarah Hall, was the only other person in the room, and stood by her partner, previously telling Teesside Crown Court that Vickers would never have harmed her. During sentencing, Nicholas Lumley KC, defending, said: \"Sarah Hall remains resolute in her belief that the father of her only child did not intend Scarlett any harm and his parents are of the same view.\" Ms Hall did not see the knife sticking in her daughter, Mr Justice Cotter said, because Vickers immediately removed it and put it on the side in the kitchen. The jury, by a majority of 10-2, convicted him of murder after 13 hours of deliberations, rather than the less serious alternative of manslaughter, or to clear him. Ms Hall and other family members in the public gallery looked stunned when the verdict was delivered. Vickers himself did not react in the dock. His sentence is the lowest minimum term the judge can pass down for a murder verdict.  During the trial, Vickers insisted his daughter's death had been a \"freak accident\". He claimed he had swiped what he thought were tongs along a work surface, into her chest, and never realised it was a knife. The judge described his version of events as \"unconvincing and wholly implausible\". Prosecutor Mark McKone KC had told jurors that Scarlett's death was not an accident. Home Office pathologist Dr Jennifer Bolton explained to the jury that how the knife went into Scarlett's chest meant it must have been held in a hand, with force. Smoked cannabis and drank wine During the sentencing, Mr Justice Cotter said Vickers had \"smoked cannabis and drank some wine\" after work. Ms Hall was cooking spaghetti bolognese when Scarlett came down from her bedroom, around 10.15pm, and they were said to have thrown grapes at each other for fun. The mother said she then snipped at Vickers with the tongs and he complained it hurt - to which Scarlett called him \"wimpy\".Ms Hall claimed to turn away to serve the meal and then heard Scarlett say \"ow\".When she looked back, their only child was said to be pouring with blood.In the 999 call, Ms Hall told the operator they had been \"messing about\" and her partner had thrown something at their daughter and \"he didn't realise\".Vickers told one paramedic that his daughter had lunged towards him during a bout of play-fighting, the court was told. \"Exactly what then happens only you know,\" the judge said, referring to the moment of the stabbing. For the sentencing, the court heard the judge took into account the fact it was a momentary act, with no premeditation. 'Loss of temper' Mr Justice Cotter said: \"Scarlett was just 14, a normal, healthy girl with a long life ahead of her when it was cut short by you. \"She died in the kitchen of her own home within minutes of having been stabbed. \"It went from an ordinary, happy family Friday night to tragedy within seconds due to what must have been your loss of temper. \"There is no other plausible explanation.\" He added: \"You have never given a truthful explanation of what happened.\" Read more from Sky News:More than 600 immigration arrests in JanuaryPolice officer sacked over tragedy chantingGrenfell Tower - what happens now? Speaking outside court, Detective Superintendent Craig Rudd said: \"We may never know precisely what happened in that kitchen, but we can be certain there is no justification for what Simon Vickers did. \"Had he not picked up that knife Scarlett would still be alive today.\""

        "Content": "By Henry Vaughan, feature writer, in Les Pesquies  Neighbours have been left in \"shock\" and fear after the sudden deaths of a popular British couple in rural France. Dawn and Andrew Searle, who have not yet been officially named by French authorities, moved to the hamlet of Les Pesquies, south of Villefranche-de-Rouergue, in southern France, around a decade ago. The couple, who are in their 60s, are believed to have been found dead by a German friend who lives nearby, after Mr Searle did not turn up for one of their regular walks. Ms Searle's son, the country musician and former Hollyoaks star Callum Kerr, said in a statement posted online that he and his sister, Amanda Kerr, and Mr Searle's two children, Tom and Ella Searle, were grieving. Investigators are reportedly looking at whether the British couple were killed during a burglary, but all lines of enquiry, including murder-suicide or potential links to Mr Searle's previous work as an organised crime financial investigator in the UK - are open. A neighbour who knew them very well told Sky News they were \"very happy people, joyful, very nice and would talk to people even if they didn't know them. They always had a smile on their face.\" Ms Searle's body was reportedly found outside their home, naked, with jewellery found scattered nearby, while Mr Searle's body was discovered inside the house and had been gagged, according to local media. \n                  Eurostar resumes direct Amsterdam-London services after eight-month pause\n                 \n                  Musician and actor Callum Kerr tells of family mourning over deaths of Dawn and Andrew Searle - as investigation details emerge in France\n                 \n                  British couple found dead at house in southern France\n                 There was little sign of their deaths at their home in the idyllic village on Monday, apart from the yellow and red Gendarmerie tape still on the white gate. Locals described them as \"good neighbours\" who would often be seen walking their two dogs. \"Each year in September they would do this big dinner with all the village and invite everyone. They were very nice people,\" said a woman who lived nearby. \"It's very sad, it's tragic. It's a very low-key village, everybody gets along with each other and everybody's in shock right now, they're surprised. \"It's scary too. The newspapers are saying possibly it's because of what he used to do as a job. Here locally, nobody would hold grudges.\" A LinkedIn profile in his name says he retired in 2015 after working for Barclays and Standard Life, and was \"enjoying life in rural France\". His page talks about having \"over 20 years experience specialising in Financial Crime Prevention (AML, Fraud and Anti-Bribery) with a high profile in the industry and an extensive network of contacts\". Another woman said she was about to buy a house in the hamlet but is now having second thoughts, adding: \"I don't feel safe here anymore\". A postman said there was a big UK expat community in the area, with around 20 British people on his round. The Searles have lived in the village permanently for 10 years and are said to be very integrated with the community. \"They would enjoy life, they would travel and sometimes go home as well,\" a neighbour said.

However, the public prosecutor Nicolas Rigot-Muller said that while both \"died violent deaths... all hypotheses remain open\" while investigations continue. A Foreign Office spokesperson said: \"We are supporting the family of a British couple who died in France and are liaising with the local authorities.\""

The Labour Party confirmed Oliver Ryan has had the whip removed, meaning he will now sit as an independent MP in the Commons. The 29-year-old Burnley MP apologised on Sunday and said he \"deeply regrets\" the comments he made, which a government source said were \"unacceptable and deeply disappointing\". According to the Daily Mail, Mr Ryan joked about a fellow Labour MP being gay. Politics latest:Police receive complaints over sacked minister's WhatsApps In a statement on X over the weekend, Mr Ryan apologised for remarks he made which he \"would not make today\", and said he would \"cooperate fully\" with the investigation. He said that between 2019 and early 2022, he was a member of a WhatsApp group \"created by my MP and former employer, Andrew Gwynne\". Mr Ryan said: \"Some of the comments made in that group were completely unacceptable, and I fully condemn them.\" Mr Ryan also said he regretted \"not speaking out at the time\", and he recognised that \"failing to do so was wrong\". \"I did not see every message, but I accept responsibility for not being more proactive in challenging what was said,\" he added. Second MP suspended by Labour over WhatsApps He is the second Labour MP to be suspended by the party for comments made in the same WhatsApp group. Andrew Gwynne was sacked as health minister and suspended from the party for alleged racist and sexist remarks posted in the same chat. The MP for Gorton and Denton reportedly made antisemitic comments and \"joked\" about a pensioner constituent, saying he hoped she died before the next election, according to the Mail On Sunday. Mr Gwynne said he deeply regretted his \"badly misjudged comments\" and apologised for any offence caused. A Labour Party spokesperson said: \"As part of our WhatsApp group investigation, Oliver Ryan has been administratively suspended as a member of the Labour Party. \"As soon as this group was brought to our attention, a thorough investigation was immediately launched and this process is ongoing in line with the Labour Party's rules and procedures. \"Swift action will always be taken where individuals are found to have breached the high standards expected of them as Labour Party members.\" Read more politics news:MPs set for above inflation pay rise to nearly £94,000Immigration arrests rise - with one raid caught on camera Meanwhile, three Labour councillors caught up in the scandal have \"stepped away\" from their duties on Tameside Council.

        "Content": "A group led by Elon Musk has made a $97.4bn (£78.7bn) bid to buy OpenAI just months after the X owner sued the artificial intelligence start-up. Mr Musk co-founded OpenAI with its current chief executive Sam Altman in 2015, but left before the company took off after it released ChatGPT in late 2022. Initially launched as a non-profit, OpenAI is currently transitioning to a for-profit model - which it says it needs to do so it can afford to develop the best AI models. Mr Musk disagrees with the move and said in a press release about the bid: \"It's time for OpenAI to return to the open-source, safety-focused force for good it once was. \"We will make sure that happens.\" The offer is being backed by Mr Musk's rival artificial intelligence company xAI, which could merge with OpenAI following a deal, according to the Wall Street Journal, which first reported the bid. OpenAI was valued at $157bn (£127bn) in its latest funding round in October last year. A deal of this size would require the investing group to raise enormous funds. Mr Musk's offer appears to have escalated longstanding tensions with his former colleague Mr Altman, who posted on X: \"no thank you but we will buy twitter for $9.74 billion if you want.\" Read more from Sky News:Fears over Gaza truce as Hamas delays next hostage releaseUS president to impose steel tariffs Mr Musk bought Twitter, now called X, for $44bn (£38bn) in 2022.

They are already embroiled in a lawsuit as Mr Musk sued both OpenAI and Mr Altman last year, accusing them of breaching a contract by pivoting towards profit, arguing OpenAI was going back on its pledge to develop AI carefully and make it freely available. Mr Musk and OpenAI lawyers faced off in a California federal court last week as a judge weighed up whether to back the X owner's request for a court order that would block the company from becoming a for-profit entity. US district judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers has not yet ruled on the request but said she would not stop the case from moving to a jury trial."

        "Content": "Antiques expert Charles Hanson, known for TV shows including Flog It! and Bargain Hunt, violently attacked and restrained his wife over a 10-year period, in some cases leaving her with physical marks, a court has heard. Hanson, 46, is charged with controlling or coercive behaviour, assault occasioning actual bodily harm, and assault by beating. The auctioneer denies all the charges. The jury at Derby Crown Court was told Hanson began using \"sufficient force\" against his wife Rebecca Hanson to leave visible marks on some occasions in 2012, about two years after they married. Opening the prosecution case, Stephen Kemp said that during the first incident, Hanson had \"put his arm around her [Mrs Hanson's] neck and then put her into a headlock\" during an argument after she threw an empty box on the floor. Mr Kemp added: \"Rebecca does not say she lost consciousness, but she was understandably scared and shocked by what her husband had just done to her. When she spoke to him afterwards, he told her he felt he had to restrain her. \"That is not accepted by either Rebecca Hanson or the prosecution. There was no need for that, and certainly not by means of a headlock... it was the first of many occasions when Mr Hanson would grab hold of his wife, we say, in anger.\" The antiques expert, who owns Hansons Auctioneers, was seen shaking his head in court as the jury heard that - over the next 10 years - he would become violent towards his wife \"every six months or so\". In 2015, it is alleged that Hanson, from Mackworth, Derby, \"gripped her so hard that it left three fingertip bruises on her arm\" which \"caused her to cry\". She took a photograph of bruising to her arm. On another occasion, the jury was told that during a COVID lockdown in March 2020, Hanson was in a \"bad mood\" and \"threw the landline telephone\" at his wife, which hit her leg. Mrs Hanson wrote in a message to her mother at the time: \"Just to let you know that Charles is being pretty nasty to me at the moment.\" In May 2022, the couple also had an argument, the court heard. It is alleged Hanson grabbed his wife on this occasion \"so forcefully that he left a red mark on her shoulder\". In the same month, the prosecution say he pushed her twice.

I can go for sessions for my anger.\" Hanson, who was arrested in June 2023, \"denied having grabbed, poked or squeezed\" his wife. The trial, which is expected to last up to two weeks, continues."

It's thought the area in Wooler was used as a Home Guard training ground and the munitions, which still contain a charge, were buried there at the end of the war. Councillor Mark Mather from Northumberland County Council, who also sits on Wooler Parish Council, told Sky News' Sarah-Jane Mee about the discovery on The UK Tonight. He said they got a call on 14 January from the contractors saying \"they thought they'd discovered a bomb\". \"We had to put a 50-metre cordon around the site,\" he said. \"The army bomb disposal team came out to the first one on the first day, and then the second bomb, the next day.\" After that, they were told they would need to hire a private contractor - who found 65 bombs on their first day of work and another 90 the next. \"We're up to 176 of these [bombs], between nine and 11 and a half pound training devices.\" He said as they still carry a charge they have to be treated as \"potentially hazardous\" live devices. Work is continuing to make the site safe and the council plans to complete the playpark. \"We're going to make sure that once the team leave that we have a certificate to say that park's 100% safe,\" Mr Mather said.

He said that the project to safely remove the munitions is estimated between £30,000 and 40,000, and Northumberland County Council have stepped in to fund the work. And Mr Mather warned there is the potential for more finds of Second World War bombs and artefacts. \"We just don't know,\" he said, adding there was concern \"different types of explosives or... World War Two memorabilia\" could be found as the works continued."

        "Content": " Assisted dying cases would not need to be signed off by a High Court judge, the MP behind a new bill has proposed. Labour MP Kim Leadbeater is expected to bring forward amendments to her proposal so a multi-disciplinary panel of experts will examine cases and have the power to grant permission for assisted death. Three-member panels would be chaired by a retired High Court judge, King's Counsel or a person with similar qualifications - and their decisions could \"if required\" be reviewed by the High Court. In the initial version of the Terminally Ill Adults (End of Life) Bill, which was backed by MPs in November, a High Court judge would have to approve requests for assistance after assent from two doctors. Ms Leadbeater has described the amended plan as a \"judge plus\" system, arguing that it strengthens safeguards against pressure or coercion as it gives an \"enhanced role for professionals such as psychiatrists and social workers\". However assisted dying critics say safeguards have been watered down, with Tory minister Danny Kruger calling the change \"a disgrace\". Labour MP Diane Abbott said the bill was \"rushed, badly thought out legislation\" which \"needs to be voted down\", while former Lib Dem leader Tim Farron said \"even the weak safeguards that existed are being dropped\". \n                  Doctors should be able to opt out of recommending assisted dying, MPs told\n                 \n                  Questions over assisted dying\n                 \n                  Cost of assisted dying 'could be tens of thousands of pounds' per person\n                  The proposal will be voted on by a committee of MPs who will begin going through the bill line by line on Tuesday. The committee, selected by Ms Leadbeater, has a 14-9 majority in favour of assisted dying based on November's vote. 'There's a role for other experts to play' In an interview with Sophy Ridge on Sky's Politics Hub, filmed on Monday afternoon, Ms Leadbeater was challenged about whether a High Court judge would be specifically required in all cases. \"I think there's a role for other experts to play,\" she said and referred to expert evidence politicians have been hearing about the Terminally Ill Adults (End of Life) Bill. \"I think what came through in the evidence was the need for a multidisciplinary approach. That's something I'm giving serious consideration to.  \"I think the legal oversight is really important, but I think that multidisciplinary approach could actually enhance the bill even further,\" she added. Read more from Sky News:Parliamentary bar re-opens after spiking claimFarage claims Labour MPs will be 'getting scared'  The new proposals would also involve the creation of a Voluntary Assisted Dying Commission to oversee all applications, chaired by a High Court judge or senior former judge. Cases would be referred to multi-disciplinary panels which can grant approval. The panel is tasked with ensuring people have the capacity to make the decision without pressure or coercion. The bill also requires two independent doctors to submit reports on each person applying for permission to die. In January, learning disability charity Mencap warned that discussions around the option of assisted dying might risk pushing \"people in a course that they don't, they may not want to go down\"."

        "Content": "By Henry Vaughan, feature writer, in Les Pesquies  Neighbours have been left in \"shock\" and fear after the sudden deaths of a popular British couple in rural France. Dawn and Andrew Searle, who have not yet been officially named by French authorities, moved to the hamlet of Les Pesquies, south of Villefranche-de-Rouergue, in southern France, around a decade ago. The couple, who are in their 60s, are believed to have been found dead by a German friend who lives nearby, after Mr Searle did not turn up for one of their regular walks. Ms Searle's son, the country musician and former Hollyoaks star Callum Kerr, said in a statement posted online that he and his sister, Amanda Kerr, and Mr Searle's two children, Tom and Ella Searle, were grieving. Investigators are reportedly looking at whether the British couple were killed during a burglary, but all lines of enquiry, including murder-suicide or potential links to Mr Searle's previous work as an organised crime financial investigator in the UK - are open. A neighbour who knew them very well told Sky News they were \"very happy people, joyful, very nice and would talk to people even if they didn't know them. They always had a smile on their face.\" Ms Searle's body was reportedly found outside their home, naked, with jewellery found scattered nearby, while Mr Searle's body was discovered inside the house and had been gagged, according to local media. \n                  Eurostar resumes direct Amsterdam-London services after eight-month pause\n                 \n                  Musician and actor Callum Kerr tells of family mourning over deaths of Dawn and Andrew Searle - as investigation details emerge in France\n                 \n                  British couple found dead at house in southern France\n                 There was little sign of their deaths at their home in the idyllic village on Monday, apart from the yellow and red Gendarmerie tape still on the white gate. Locals described them as \"good neighbours\" who would often be seen walking their two dogs. \"Each year in September they would do this big dinner with all the village and invite everyone. They were very nice people,\" said a woman who lived nearby. \"It's very sad, it's tragic. It's a very low-key village, everybody gets along with each other and everybody's in shock right now, they're surprised. \"It's scary too. The newspapers are saying possibly it's because of what he used to do as a job. Here locally, nobody would hold grudges.\" A LinkedIn profile in his name says he retired in 2015 after working for Barclays and Standard Life, and was \"enjoying life in rural France\". His page talks about having \"over 20 years experience specialising in Financial Crime Prevention (AML, Fraud and Anti-Bribery) with a high profile in the industry and an extensive network of contacts\". Another woman said she was about to buy a house in the hamlet but is now having second thoughts, adding: \"I don't feel safe here anymore\". A postman said there was a big UK expat community in the area, with around 20 British people on his round. The Searles have lived in the village permanently for 10 years and are said to be very integrated with the community. \"They would enjoy life, they would travel and sometimes go home as well,\" a neighbour said.

However, the public prosecutor Nicolas Rigot-Muller said that while both \"died violent deaths... all hypotheses remain open\" while investigations continue. A Foreign Office spokesperson said: \"We are supporting the family of a British couple who died in France and are liaising with the local authorities.\""

        "Content": "A teenage soldier who was found dead at a military camp felt \"trapped\" by the \"possessive and psychotic\" behaviour of her army line manager, an inquest has heard. Royal Artillery Gunner Jaysley Beck was found dead at Larkhill Camp in Wiltshire on 15 December 2021. A military inquiry report published in October 2023 described \"an intense period of unwelcome behaviour\" and said it was \"almost certain this was a causal factor\" in the 19-year-old's death. An inquest into her death heard Gunner Beck received thousands of messages from Bombardier Ryan Mason in a single month and his behaviour was \"freaking her out\". Her mother, Leighann McCready, described how her daughter \"did not feel safe\" as the situation involving Mr Mason intensified. The Salisbury hearing was shown a series of WhatsApp messages between Gunner Beck and Mr Mason between October 2021 and December 2021. In one message to Gunner Beck, on 21 October, Mr Mason wrote: \"Love you Jayse. As a friend.\" On 11 November, he wrote: \"You're amazing Jayse, I appreciate you so much, I love everything about you, even your flaws.\" On 25 November, Gunner Beck wrote to Mr Mason, telling him the situation was \"becoming a bit too much\" and \"weighing me down\". She added: \"Totally honest here, I just don't want to hear how you feel about me.\" Ms McCready said her daughter had received 3,600 messages from Mr Mason in the month of November - and Gunner Beck had expressed fears he was watching her. She added her daughter had phoned her on 7 December when she was staying in a hotel in Newbury for work. Gunner Beck was \"upset and crying\" and was \"afraid something would happen,\" Ms McCready said. \"Ryan was freaking her out,\" she added. 'It's not normal behaviour' The inquest was shown a draft text message that Gunner Beck had planned to send Mr Mason. It said: \"I honestly feel trapped in this whole situation, I have tried to act as normal as possible because we are working together but nothing normal about this situation. \"It's possessive and psychotic, you have to understand it's not normal behaviour. \"I am struggling to deal with all of this, it's taking a huge toll on my own mental health for many personal reasons. I need time out.\" Read more on Sky News:Snow hits parts of UK amid freezing windsRare Einstein ring spotted from far-away galaxy The inquest was also told that Gunner Beck had complained of being assaulted by a sergeant who put his hand \"between her legs\" while on a team-building stay at Thorney Island, near Emsworth, Hampshire, in July 2021.

Hanson, 46, is charged with controlling or coercive behaviour, assault occasioning actual bodily harm, and assault by beating. The auctioneer denies all the charges. The jury at Derby Crown Court was told Hanson began using \"sufficient force\" against his wife Rebecca Hanson to leave visible marks on some occasions in 2012, about two years after they married. Opening the prosecution case, Stephen Kemp said that during the first incident, Hanson had \"put his arm around her [Mrs Hanson's] neck and then put her into a headlock\" during an argument after she threw an empty box on the floor. Mr Kemp added: \"Rebecca does not say she lost consciousness, but she was understandably scared and shocked by what her husband had just done to her. When she spoke to him afterwards, he told her he felt he had to restrain her. \"That is not accepted by either Rebecca Hanson or the prosecution. There was no need for that, and certainly not by means of a headlock... it was the first of many occasions when Mr Hanson would grab hold of his wife, we say, in anger.\" The antiques expert, who owns Hansons Auctioneers, was seen shaking his head in court as the jury heard that - over the next 10 years - he would become violent towards his wife \"every six months or so\". In 2015, it is alleged that Hanson, from Mackworth, Derby, \"gripped her so hard that it left three fingertip bruises on her arm\" which \"caused her to cry\". She took a photograph of bruising to her arm. On another occasion, the jury was told that during a COVID lockdown in March 2020, Hanson was in a \"bad mood\" and \"threw the landline telephone\" at his wife, which hit her leg. Mrs Hanson wrote in a message to her mother at the time: \"Just to let you know that Charles is being pretty nasty to me at the moment.\" In May 2022, the couple also had an argument, the court heard. It is alleged Hanson grabbed his wife on this occasion \"so forcefully that he left a red mark on her shoulder\". In the same month, the prosecution say he pushed her twice.

I can go for sessions for my anger.\" Hanson, who was arrested in June 2023, \"denied having grabbed, poked or squeezed\" his wife. The trial, which is expected to last up to two weeks, continues."

        "Content": "Sir Salman Rushdie was so stunned he didn't try to fight back after a masked man stabbed him on stage, a court has heard.  The 77-year-old author was attacked moments before he was due to present a lecture on keeping writers safe in New York in August 2022. He was left seriously wounded and blind in one eye. Hadi Matar, 27, is now standing trial for attempted murder and assault. He has pleaded not guilty and said \"Free Palestine\" as he was brought into Chautauqua County court in Mayville, New York, on Monday. As the opening statements were delivered, district attorney Jason Schmidt described a sudden attack by Matar - saying he bound up a small staircase and burst onto the stage as the event got under way. Both Sir Salman and fellow speaker Henry Reese - who was also injured - were so stunned by the attack that they initially remained in their seats, the court heard. Mr Schmidt said: \"Without hesitation, this man holding his knife […] forcefully and efficiently in its speed, plunged the knife into Mr Rushdie over and over and over again.\" Matar was \"stabbing, swinging, slicing into Mr Rushdie's head, his throat, his abdomen, his thigh\", Mr Schmidt added. \"It all happened so fast that even the person under attack, Mr Rushdie, and the person sitting next to him, Mr Reese, didn't register what was happening,\" the prosecutor said. More from Sky News:Trump's aid cuts spark 'total panic'Fears over Gaza truce It is believed Sir Salman will testify during the trial, which is expected to last 10 days. The Indian-born British-American author previously detailed the attack - and his long recovery - in his 2024 memoir, Knife: Meditations After An Attempted Murder. The Booker Prize winner had worried for his safety since his 1989 novel The Satanic Verses was labelled blasphemous by many Muslims. The book led to Iran's Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini issuing a fatwa calling for his death and Sir Salman spent years in hiding. He has travelled freely for the past 25 years, after Iran said it would not enforce the decree. The trial is taking place as the 36th anniversary of the fatwa - 14 February - approaches. Jurors will be shown videos and photos of the attack, which ended when onlookers rushed Matar and held him until police arrived. It is unclear what Matar's defence will be."

        "Content": " A father has been sentenced to life in prison with a minimum term of 15 years for the murder of his 14-year-old daughter. Simon Vickers was found guilty last month of killing his daughter Scarlett Vickers after stabbing her in the heart at their home in Darlington, County Durham, in July 2024. The 50-year-old, who denied charges of manslaughter and murder, gave different accounts of what happened in the seconds before he plunged a kitchen knife 11cm into her chest. As it happened: Simon Vickers sentencing Scarlett's mother, Sarah Hall, was the only other person in the room, and stood by her partner, previously telling Teesside Crown Court that Vickers would never have harmed her. During sentencing, Nicholas Lumley KC, defending, said: \"Sarah Hall remains resolute in her belief that the father of her only child did not intend Scarlett any harm and his parents are of the same view.\" Ms Hall did not see the knife sticking in her daughter, Mr Justice Cotter said, because Vickers immediately removed it and put it on the side in the kitchen. The jury, by a majority of 10-2, convicted him of murder after 13 hours of deliberations, rather than the less serious alternative of manslaughter, or to clear him. Ms Hall and other family members in the public gallery looked stunned when the verdict was delivered. Vickers himself did not react in the dock. His sentence is the lowest minimum term the judge can pass down for a murder verdict.  During the trial, Vickers insisted his daughter's death had been a \"freak accident\". He claimed he had swiped what he thought were tongs along a work surface, into her chest, and never realised it was a knife. The judge described his version of events as \"unconvincing and wholly implausible\". Prosecutor Mark McKone KC had told jurors that Scarlett's death was not an accident. Home Office pathologist Dr Jennifer Bolton explained to the jury that how the knife went into Scarlett's chest meant it must have been held in a hand, with force. Smoked cannabis and drank wine During the sentencing, Mr Justice Cotter said Vickers had \"smoked cannabis and drank some wine\" after work. Ms Hall was cooking spaghetti bolognese when Scarlett came down from her bedroom, around 10.15pm, and they were said to have thrown grapes at each other for fun. The mother said she then snipped at Vickers with the tongs and he complained it hurt - to which Scarlett called him \"wimpy\".Ms Hall claimed to turn away to serve the meal and then heard Scarlett say \"ow\".When she looked back, their only child was said to be pouring with blood.In the 999 call, Ms Hall told the operator they had been \"messing about\" and her partner had thrown something at their daughter and \"he didn't realise\".Vickers told one paramedic that his daughter had lunged towards him during a bout of play-fighting, the court was told. \"Exactly what then happens only you know,\" the judge said, referring to the moment of the stabbing. For the sentencing, the court heard the judge took into account the fact it was a momentary act, with no premeditation. 'Loss of temper' Mr Justice Cotter said: \"Scarlett was just 14, a normal, healthy girl with a long life ahead of her when it was cut short by you. \"She died in the kitchen of her own home within minutes of having been stabbed. \"It went from an ordinary, happy family Friday night to tragedy within seconds due to what must have been your loss of temper. \"There is no other plausible explanation.\" He added: \"You have never given a truthful explanation of what happened.\" Read more from Sky News:More than 600 immigration arrests in JanuaryPolice officer sacked over tragedy chantingGrenfell Tower - what happens now? Speaking outside court, Detective Superintendent Craig Rudd said: \"We may never know precisely what happened in that kitchen, but we can be certain there is no justification for what Simon Vickers did. \"Had he not picked up that knife Scarlett would still be alive today.\""

It's thought the area in Wooler was used as a Home Guard training ground and the munitions, which still contain a charge, were buried there at the end of the war. Councillor Mark Mather from Northumberland County Council, who also sits on Wooler Parish Council, told Sky News' Sarah-Jane Mee about the discovery on The UK Tonight. He said they got a call on 14 January from the contractors saying \"they thought they'd discovered a bomb\". \"We had to put a 50-metre cordon around the site,\" he said. \"The army bomb disposal team came out to the first one on the first day, and then the second bomb, the next day.\" After that, they were told they would need to hire a private contractor - who found 65 bombs on their first day of work and another 90 the next. \"We're up to 176 of these [bombs], between nine and 11 and a half pound training devices.\" He said as they still carry a charge they have to be treated as \"potentially hazardous\" live devices. Work is continuing to make the site safe and the council plans to complete the playpark. \"We're going to make sure that once the team leave that we have a certificate to say that park's 100% safe,\" Mr Mather said.

And Mr Mather warned there is the potential for more finds of Second World War bombs and artefacts. \"We just don't know,\" he said, adding there was concern \"different types of explosives or... World War Two memorabilia\" could be found as the works continued."

Spokesman Abu Obeida said Hamas remained committed if Israel kept to the terms, but that the 15 February handover was postponed \"until the occupation commits to and compensates for the past weeks\". Egyptian security sources told Reuters that mediators now fear the deal will break down. They said Hamas believes Israel isn't serious about the ceasefire - which began on 19 January. The last hostage release took place at the weekend and saw three Israeli men set free. Five Thai citizens released last month were also finally reunited with their families in Bangkok. They were among about 250 people taken during the 7 October 2023 attack, when 1,200 people were murdered.  Five swaps have taken place so far, with 21 hostages and more than 730 Palestinian prisoners released. Saturday's exchange was due to involve three more Israelis and hundreds of Palestinians. Defence minister Israel Katz said any delay in releasing hostages would be \"a complete violation\" and he had instructed troops to be on highest alert. The Hostages and Missing Family Forum called on mediating countries to restore the deal, saying \"time is of the essence\" and citing \"the shocking conditions of the hostages released last Saturday\". Read more:Trump plan so outrageous it might be part of something bigger Israeli police confiscate books in raid on Palestinian bookshops As part of the ceasefire deal, Israeli forces pulled back from a key passage through Gaza on Sunday. The four-mile-long Netzarim corridor separates northern Gaza from the south, and hundreds of thousands of displaced Palestinians have now crossed back over. However, Israel pushed back the withdrawal by a few days in protest at the chaotic release of hostages Arbel Yehud and Gadi Moses. This may be what Hamas is referencing what it talks of \"delaying the return of the displaced\".  There have also been examples of Israeli troops shooting at or near Palestinians approaching Israeli forces after being warned to stay back. So far, little progress has been made on an extension to the first six-week phase of the ceasefire. A delegation from Israel has arrived in Qatar for further talks amid concern the deal might collapse before all remaining hostages are freed. Israel has previously said it will not agree to a complete withdrawal from Gaza until Hamas's military and political capabilities are eliminated. Hamas has countered that it will not hand over the final hostages until Israel removes all its troops from Gaza."

The president last week debuted his suggestion to \"own\" Gaza and shut out Hamas while it's redeveloped, but has now contradicted officials who had said any relocation would be temporary. Asked by Fox News if Palestinians could return, he replied: \"No, they wouldn't, because they're going to have much better housing. In other words, I'm talking about building a permanent place for them.\" Trump latest: President signs more executive orders Speaking on Monday at the White House, Mr Trump also suggested the current ceasefire in Gaza should end on Saturday if Hamas does not release hostages as planned. He then went further, saying all the remaining hostages should be released by midday on Saturday, or the ceasefire should be cancelled - and that \"all hell is going to break out\" if the hostages are not freed then. But the US president added: \"I'm speaking for myself. Israel can override it.\" Hamas said earlier it would delay the release of hostages - accusing Israel of violating the ceasefire.  Mr Trump told Fox News his future vision for Gaza was to build multiple \"safe communities, a little bit away from where they are, where all of this danger is\", adding the area is currently \"not habitable\". He said he believed he could cut a deal with Jordan or Egypt to take people in. However, Arab allies - including Egypt and Saudi Arabia - have dismissed the idea of relocating Gaza's two-million-plus population. Western countries have also rejected the proposal; an independent state for Palestinians remains the favoured way forward but is a no-go for the Israeli government. When asked in the media, Palestinians have also rubbished the idea. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has supported Mr Trump's controversial proposal. Much of Gaza lies in ruins due to Israel's attempt to wipe out Hamas after its 2023 terror attack that killed around 1,200 people in Israel. About 250 were also kidnapped, but those still alive have started to be released in recent weeks after a hard-won truce took effect last month. Since the ceasefire began on 19 January, five swaps have taken place - with 16 Israeli and five Thai hostages released. In total, Israel has said it will release up to 1,904 Palestinian prisoners in return for 33 Israeli hostages during the deal's first phase. Read more:Trump plan so outrageous it might be part of something biggerIsraeli police confiscate books in raid on Palestinian bookshops US correspondent From Donald Trump, it's a hardened \"No\". Asked directly if Palestinians would have the right to return to a redeveloped Gaza, he told Fox News Channel's Brett Baier: \"No, they wouldn't, because they're going to have much better housing.\" If the notion of Trump building on Gaza has offended its people, most offensive is the prospect for them of no return. Since Donald Trump first suggested taking and building on Palestinian land, observers in America, the Middle East and all countries in between have been assessing its seriousness.  \n Everything he's said since indicates he's committed both to the project and to ignoring entrenched objections from allies and adversaries alike.\n In spite of flat refusals by Jordan and Egypt to resettle Palestinians in those countries, Trump said: \"I think I could make a deal with Jordan. I think I could make a deal with Egypt. You know, we give them billions and billions of dollars a year.\"\n If peace in the Middle East was a matter of money, it would have been solved long ago. Tuesday's meeting in Washington between Trump and Jordan's King Abdullah won't be easy.  \n In the White House, the Jordanian leader will talk numbers of his own – the hundreds of thousands of Palestinian refugees already living in the Hashemite kingdom and the instability threatened by moving more.   Trump is also due to meet the Egyptian president and the Saudi crown prince in the coming days – it is a chorus of Arab voices to caution an expansionist president at a delicate time, as parties involved in the current conflict work through the phases of a ceasefire deal.   Trump's plan is radical and it invites fresh-eyed debate over a way forward for the region. However, it is the property deal that separates a people from their home – again. At the heart of a radical plan, it's the inherent recklessness.\n So far, little progress has been made on an extension to the first six-week phase of the ceasefire. A delegation from Israel has arrived in Qatar for further talks amid concern the deal might collapse before all remaining hostages are freed."

        "Content": "\n          International correspondent\n              @sparkomat\n In what will be seen as a signature act of the new Trump administration, the president and his team have denounced and dismembered the US government's international assistance arm, USAID, in a matter of three weeks. It is a decision that will have serious, real-world consequences - and the impact is already being felt in countries such as Uganda. Trump latest: President doubles down on Gaza plan The health ministry in Uganda has announced its intention to shut all dedicated HIV/AIDS and tuberculosis (TB) clinics in the country. Stand-alone pharmacies supplying antiretroviral drugs will also be closed. These facilities provide HIV treatments and preventative therapies to millions of people in Uganda, including an estimated 1.5 million currently living with the virus. An official said the closure of HIV clinics was a necessary response as the country grapples with the loss of funding from USAID. Directors and staff at the country's public hospitals have been instructed to offer the same services at their outpatients and chronic care departments. A USAID initiative called the President's Emergency Plan For AIDS Relief - or PEPFAR - has bankrolled much of Uganda's HIV/AIDS relief plan and it's an initiative that has wielded impressive results. Specially trained staff and dedicated clinics are credited with bringing infection rates down from 19% in the late 1990s to 5% in 2024. 'We are still reeling' Flavia Kyomukama, from the National Forum of People Living with HIV/AIDS Networks Uganda (NAFOPHANU), said she was stunned by Donald Trump's decision. \"We are still reeling from the shock of what they have done, it is very difficult to understand,\" she said. \"There was a memorandum of support [between both countries], there was roadmap [towards zero infections] and they make this decision in a day.\" Shifting HIV/AIDS-related care to public hospitals is deeply problematic, Ms Kyomukama added. These facilities are often overwhelmed, and they offer little, or no, privacy. It is a serious issue in a country where those carrying the virus are badly stigmatised. \"Surveys show 30% of health workers have a negative attitude towards people with HIV,\" Ms Kyomukama said. \"So, we're going to see [patients] dropping out [of their treatment plans], drug resistance will increase and we will see more violence in hospital as people with HIV get attacked.\" International correspondent The Trump administration's destruction of USAID will bring about the virtual collapse of the international aid and development system, experts have warned.  The US government puts far more money into humanitarian assistance than any other country.  In 2023, the most recent year for which data is largely complete, the Americans disbursed $71.9bn (£57bn) in foreign aid, representing 1.2% of total US government spending.  It is a spending commitment that has remained remarkably consistent over the years.  The Americans underwrite programmes in 177 individual countries with Ukraine registering as the biggest recipient in 2023. It received $16.6bn (£12.9bn) to maintain government services after the Russian invasion.  PEPFAR, USAID's best-known initiative, provides antiretroviral treatments to 20 million people infected with HIV/AIDS.  The initiative supports NGO-run groups with an extended workforce of 350,000 people – with many employed at local clinics. The US also bankrolls key UN organisations, such as the refugee agency (UNHCR). Its total budget of $4.8bn (£3.8bn) is propped up by the Americans, who put in US$2bn (£1.6bn).  Without this funding, it is difficult to see how UNHCR can continue to support tens of millions of refugees in countries including Sudan, Syria, Turkey and the Democratic Republic of Congo.  If the residents of refugee camps are not supported with basic services, they are likely to move.  The question then is how US funding compares to other donors – and the answer is startling.  According to the UN's real-time financial tracking service, Germany contributed funds in 2024 representing 8% of total humanitarian aid contributions, as did the European Union, with the United Kingdom at 6%.  The world, then, is worryingly dependent on the United States.  Former international aid worker turned consultant Thomas Byrnes said: \"The modern humanitarian system has been shaped by a long-term commitment from the US.  \"For decades, organisations like the UN agencies have relied on this predictable funding stream to address global crises.  \"The world faces a major shock and I don't think anyone is prepared for it.\" To alleviate the situation, Mr Byrnes said other donors – such as the UK and Germany – will need to make up the funding shortfall from USAID.  But that is highly unlikely to happen.    The United Kingdom, currently contributing $2.1bn (£1.7bn), would need to contribute an additional $1.5bn (£1.2bn) – representing a 74% increase.  For Germany, the required extra contribution would be $1.8bn (£1.5bn), representing a substantial increase of 70%. Furthermore, Trump's move comes at a time when Germany, France, Sweden and others are planning deep cuts to international aid.  The world is looking at a colossal funding gap – and a colossal crisis - as the number of people in need of humanitarian assistance rises to 305 million people, Mr Byrnes added. \"We're facing a perfect storm,\" he said. \"The brutal math means we're heading toward humanitarian aid of just 17 cents per person per day. \"This isn't a funding dip - it's a systemic shock that will force impossible choices about who receives help and who doesn't. People will die as a result of this.\" 'It's total panic right now' Brian Aliganyira is the director of Ark Wellness Hub, a busy health clinic for the LGBT+ community in Uganda's capital, Kampala. The clinic has sourced supplies - such as antiretroviral drugs, preventative 'PrEP' therapies and testing kits - from partners who are underpinned by USAID. Now, the 37-year-old has got a major problem on his hands. \"It's total panic right now,\" he said. \"Our response teams are panicking and there is a lot of panic in the community. \"We are telling people to go home and it's not just [our clinic]. There is no more medication left - or maybe there's one refill at the most. But people keep asking us, 'have you got any extra, any extra'? \"Without the support we need, HIV will surge and people will die.\" 'Lives will be lost' There are some still clinging to hope. On 1 February, US secretary of state Marco Rubio issued a waiver exempting the PEPFAR programme from the new administration's cuts to foreign aid. However, President Trump issued a contradictory order banning programmes designed to \"advance equality and human rights for lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, and intersex people\".

        "Content": "\n          Middle East correspondent\n              @AliBunkallSKY\n  Israeli police have confiscated books and arrested Palestinian booksellers following a raid on two famous East Jerusalem bookshops. The raid on The Educational Bookshops happened on Sunday and hundreds of titles relating to the ongoing conflict in the region were bagged up and taken away, with police accusing the pair of inciting terrorism. That charge was reduced to a public order offence. Mahmoud Muna, who went to university in England, and his nephew Ahmad, appeared in Jerusalem Magistrates Court on Monday morning. They have since been detained in prison for another 24 hours and will have to serve five days of house arrest once released. The prosecution demanded the men be held for a further eight days to allow police time to examine the books, but the judge decided they should only remain in prison until Tuesday. A small group of protesters gathered outside holding signs such as \"cowards confiscate books\" and \"Palestinian books matter\". Speaking following the hearing, their lawyer, Nasser Odeh, said: \"We made it clear that this is a very dangerous and legally unprecedented move, forming part of a new policy adopted by the Israeli police in Jerusalem, which seeks to suppress freedom of speech and Palestinian intellectual life, preventing people from educating themselves and others.\" The bookshops, along with a third at The American Colony Hotel, are east Jerusalem cultural institutions, popular with locals, diplomats, foreign journalists and tourists. Murad Muna, the brother of Mahmoud, said there was \"no reason\" to arrest them. \"The books we sell are international books, there is many books that are written by Israeli authors. There is no logical reason to arrest them.\" Mahmoud's 11-year-old daughter was in the shop at the time. Her mother, Mahmoud's wife, attended the court session along with at least a dozen diplomats. \"She saw everything, she was really shocked but we talked last night before bed and told her that everything will be fine, your Dad is strong and you don't have to worry,\" May Muna told Sky News. \"They took books with Palestinian flags, they even took a colouring book for kids.\" Germany's Ambassador to Israel criticised the police actions, writing on X: \"I, like many diplomats, enjoy browsing for books at Educational Bookshop. I know its owners, the Muna family, to be peace-loving proud Palestinian Jerusalemites, open for discussion and intellectual exchange.\" In a statement, Jerusalem Police said their officers arrested the two men \"suspected of selling books containing incitement and support for terrorism\". Israeli police posted a picture on X of a colouring book titled From The River To The Sea. The phrase is a reference to territory between the Jordan River and the Mediterranean Sea - an area that today includes all of Israel. It's interpreted by many Israelis as an antisemitic statement calling for the elimination of the country, but Palestinian activists say it's an aspirational call for human rights and peaceful co-existence.

Most of Jerusalem's Palestinians live in the east of the city. The area was captured by Israel in 1967 - a move not recognised internationally - and Palestinians want it as the capital of a future state. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu opposes a two-state solution and has significant backing from Donald Trump. The US president last week suggested moving Palestinians out of Gaza so the US can \"own\" and rebuild it following the devastation caused by the Gaza war. The idea has been dismissed and derided by the vast majority of the international community."

        "Content": "By Henry Vaughan, feature writer, in Les Pesquies  Neighbours have been left in \"shock\" and fear after the sudden deaths of a popular British couple in rural France. Dawn and Andrew Searle, who have not yet been officially named by French authorities, moved to the hamlet of Les Pesquies, south of Villefranche-de-Rouergue, in southern France, around a decade ago. The couple, who are in their 60s, are believed to have been found dead by a German friend who lives nearby, after Mr Searle did not turn up for one of their regular walks. Ms Searle's son, the country musician and former Hollyoaks star Callum Kerr, said in a statement posted online that he and his sister, Amanda Kerr, and Mr Searle's two children, Tom and Ella Searle, were grieving. Investigators are reportedly looking at whether the British couple were killed during a burglary, but all lines of enquiry, including murder-suicide or potential links to Mr Searle's previous work as an organised crime financial investigator in the UK - are open. A neighbour who knew them very well told Sky News they were \"very happy people, joyful, very nice and would talk to people even if they didn't know them. They always had a smile on their face.\" Ms Searle's body was reportedly found outside their home, naked, with jewellery found scattered nearby, while Mr Searle's body was discovered inside the house and had been gagged, according to local media. \n                  Eurostar resumes direct Amsterdam-London services after eight-month pause\n                 \n                  Musician and actor Callum Kerr tells of family mourning over deaths of Dawn and Andrew Searle - as investigation details emerge in France\n                 \n                  British couple found dead at house in southern France\n                 There was little sign of their deaths at their home in the idyllic village on Monday, apart from the yellow and red Gendarmerie tape still on the white gate. Locals described them as \"good neighbours\" who would often be seen walking their two dogs. \"Each year in September they would do this big dinner with all the village and invite everyone. They were very nice people,\" said a woman who lived nearby. \"It's very sad, it's tragic. It's a very low-key village, everybody gets along with each other and everybody's in shock right now, they're surprised. \"It's scary too. The newspapers are saying possibly it's because of what he used to do as a job. Here locally, nobody would hold grudges.\" A LinkedIn profile in his name says he retired in 2015 after working for Barclays and Standard Life, and was \"enjoying life in rural France\". His page talks about having \"over 20 years experience specialising in Financial Crime Prevention (AML, Fraud and Anti-Bribery) with a high profile in the industry and an extensive network of contacts\". Another woman said she was about to buy a house in the hamlet but is now having second thoughts, adding: \"I don't feel safe here anymore\". A postman said there was a big UK expat community in the area, with around 20 British people on his round. The Searles have lived in the village permanently for 10 years and are said to be very integrated with the community. \"They would enjoy life, they would travel and sometimes go home as well,\" a neighbour said.

However, the public prosecutor Nicolas Rigot-Muller said that while both \"died violent deaths... all hypotheses remain open\" while investigations continue. A Foreign Office spokesperson said: \"We are supporting the family of a British couple who died in France and are liaising with the local authorities.\""

The 77-year-old author was attacked moments before he was due to present a lecture on keeping writers safe in New York in August 2022. He was left seriously wounded and blind in one eye. Hadi Matar, 27, is now standing trial for attempted murder and assault. He has pleaded not guilty and said \"Free Palestine\" as he was brought into Chautauqua County court in Mayville, New York, on Monday. As the opening statements were delivered, district attorney Jason Schmidt described a sudden attack by Matar - saying he bound up a small staircase and burst onto the stage as the event got under way. Both Sir Salman and fellow speaker Henry Reese - who was also injured - were so stunned by the attack that they initially remained in their seats, the court heard. Mr Schmidt said: \"Without hesitation, this man holding his knife […] forcefully and efficiently in its speed, plunged the knife into Mr Rushdie over and over and over again.\" Matar was \"stabbing, swinging, slicing into Mr Rushdie's head, his throat, his abdomen, his thigh\", Mr Schmidt added. \"It all happened so fast that even the person under attack, Mr Rushdie, and the person sitting next to him, Mr Reese, didn't register what was happening,\" the prosecutor said. More from Sky News:Trump's aid cuts spark 'total panic'Fears over Gaza truce It is believed Sir Salman will testify during the trial, which is expected to last 10 days. The Indian-born British-American author previously detailed the attack - and his long recovery - in his 2024 memoir, Knife: Meditations After An Attempted Murder. The Booker Prize winner had worried for his safety since his 1989 novel The Satanic Verses was labelled blasphemous by many Muslims. The book led to Iran's Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini issuing a fatwa calling for his death and Sir Salman spent years in hiding. He has travelled freely for the past 25 years, after Iran said it would not enforce the decree. The trial is taking place as the 36th anniversary of the fatwa - 14 February - approaches. Jurors will be shown videos and photos of the attack, which ended when onlookers rushed Matar and held him until police arrived. It is unclear what Matar's defence will be."

There are no exceptions. This is an across-the-board levy. Canada, Mexico, and Brazil will be hit hard as major steel exporting countries. In Asia the news will rattle South Korea, Vietnam, Australia, and Japan who are significant steel exporters to the US. Trump tariffs - US trade war latest Australia has already said it will try to negotiate an exemption, and it won't be alone. Talking directly to the US and presenting a case that these tariffs are not in the US national interest is the only way to get Trump to back down. Each country will have to find a way to stand up to the US and fight its corner. Until now, the Trump tariffs have targeted specific countries, with 10% on China and an initial 25% for Canada and Mexico. China has retaliated with 10-15% tariffs on crude oil, liquified natural gas, coal, farm machinery and pick-up trucks. However, it's also chosen other levers to pull, restricting access to 25 critical minerals and sanctioning several US companies. President Trump and China's President Xi Jinping are due to speak on the phone. Trump has said he's in no rush to have the call. It's not known when it will happen. What could China offer Mr Trump in return? He may want their help to pressure Russia to end the war in Ukraine. It's unclear whether President Xi would be prepared to do that. While the West is bogged down and distracted by a war in Ukraine and a global trade war, China can focus on its national priorities without interference. There is also another opportunity for China here. It wants to present itself as a stable and reliable trading partner to \"Global South\" countries.

        "Content": "\n          Science and Technology reporter\n       Heads of state and tech bosses are gathering, with some trying to break US and Chinese dominance in artificial intelligence. Top government officials and scientists from around 100 countries are gathering in Paris for the AI Action Summit, which will discuss the future of artificial intelligence. Co-hosted by India's Narendra Modi, the summit's guests also include US vice president JD Vance, Canada's Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and China's deputy leader Zhang Guoqing. It's Mr Vance's first overseas trip in his new position, but many of the summit's attendees, including Mr Modi, are hoping to break his country's dominance in artificial intelligence. The ten biggest AI companies in the world are based in the US including Apple, Nvidia, Microsoft, Oracle, Meta and Alphabet. A fortnight ago, Chinese company DeepSeek also threw the industry into chaos when it revealed an AI model more powerful than ChatGPT and made for a fraction of the cost, showing just how powerful China could be in the industry. Mr Modi has said he intends to bring a wider range of people into AI development and prevent the sector from becoming a US-China battle. His foreign secretary Vikram Misri also stressed the need for equitable access to AI to avoid \"perpetuating a digital divide that is already existing across the world\". Analysis:Paris summit shows dangers of AI race Innovation, regulation and the challenges of embracing AI However, breaking US dominance may be easier said than done, especially for countries with stricter AI regulation. President Trump has already torn up rules imposed by Joe Biden, saying they \"hinder[ed] AI innovation and impose[d] onerous and unnecessary government control over the development of AI\". That's a sentiment echoed by big tech bosses. \"If we want growth, jobs and progress, we must allow innovators to innovate, builders to build and developers to develop,\" Sam Altman, chief executive of OpenAI, wrote in Le Monde ahead of the summit. \"There's a lot of complicated questions to resolve\" around issues like the ability to control AI systems, said Sir Demis Hassabis, founder of Google DeepMind, at the summit. \"But also I think even more complicated are maybe the geopolitical questions about things like regulation.\" Companies in EU countries, for example, may find it harder to innovate than those in the US or China after the EU introduced the AI Safety Bill last year, which imposes strict restrictions on how AI can be used in the region. The UK also has guidelines around how AI can be used, but in January, Sir Keir Starmer promised to \"mainline AI into the veins\" of the country, saying AI could bring £47bn to the economy every year. As well as politicians, the tech world's elite are in the French capital, with Mr Altman, Microsoft president Brad Smith and Google chief executive Sundar Pichai among the big names attending. What keeps AI experts awake at night Yoshua Bengio, known as one of the \"godfathers of AI\", will also speak at the event. The scientist recently said he is \"kept awake at night\" by the fear that humans may build systems \"smarter than us that we don't know how to control\". Protecting people from unregulated AI is one of the topics up for discussion at the conference but a leaked draft of the document that will be signed by attending countries tomorrow doesn't appear to mention mitigating AI's risks. Read more:UK to 'lose AI leadership' without data strategyHow to protect your privacy from AI  One attendee, MIT professor Max Tegmark who is the president of the Future of Life Institute, urged countries not to sign the document. \"To reap unimaginable benefits without endangering millions of livelihoods and lives, AI needs binding safety standards - like we have for every other industry,\" he said in a statement to Sky News. \"This is supported by history, science, public opinion and common-sense. This critical moment calls for courageous leaders who take action - not ones who bury their heads in the sand to appease Big Tech. \"Countries should not sign it.\""

Nearly 50 bodies have already been uncovered, with fears authorities may still find more. On Friday, 19 bodies were found in the first mass grave, according to Libyan authorities, with at least 28 more discovered on Sunday in a second mass grave - both in Kufra, in the southeast of the country. The IOM, a United Nations agency, said that across the two mass graves, some of the bodies had gunshot wounds. Al Abreen, a charity which helps migrants in Libya, also said some of the dead were apparently shot and killed. At the second grave, Mohamed al Fadeil, head of the security chamber in Kufra, said survivors believed there were around 70 people buried there, meaning more bodies were likely to be recovered. The nationalities of the dead remain unknown. During the police raids which discovered the graves, 76 migrants were freed \"from forced detention\". \"The loss of these lives is yet another tragic reminder of the dangers faced by migrants embarking on perilous journeys,\" said Nicoletta Giordano, IOM's Libya chief of mission. She added: \"Far too many migrants along these journeys endure severe exploitation, violence and abuse, underscoring the need to prioritise human rights and protect those at risk.\" Libya's attorney general said there had been three arrests during the raid on the second grave - of one Libyan and two foreigners. It added that the gang allegedly responsible for the trafficking had subjected the migrants to violence and even \"tortured\" some.

Last year, authorities discovered at least 65 migrants in a mass grave in the Shuayrif region, 220 miles (350km) south of the capital, Tripoli. The country is a key part of the route for migrants from Africa and the Middle East trying to get to Europe. Libya was plunged into chaos by a NATO-backed uprising that toppled and killed dictator Muammar Gaddafi in 2011. The oil-rich country has been ruled for most of the past decade by rival governments in its east and west, each backed by foreign governments and an array of militias. Human traffickers have exploited the chaos, packing desperate migrants into boats ill-equipped for the Mediterranean voyage to Europe."

The US president's intervention came hours after Hamas has said it will delay the release of more hostages and accused Israel of violating their ceasefire deal. While signing a series of new executive orders, Mr Trump said he feared many Israeli hostages scheduled for release are already dead. Referring to his Saturday deadline for the release of hostages, Mr Trump said: \"If they're not here, all hell is going to break out.\" He acknowledged that a decision to end the ceasefire was up to Israel, adding: \"I'm speaking for myself.

Spokesman Abu Obeida said Hamas remained committed if Israel kept to the terms, but that the 15 February handover was postponed \"until the occupation commits to and compensates for the past weeks\". Egyptian security sources told Reuters that mediators now fear the deal will break down. They said Hamas believes Israel isn't serious about the ceasefire - which began on 19 January. The last hostage release took place at the weekend and saw three Israeli men set free. Five Thai citizens released last month were also finally reunited with their families in Bangkok. They were among about 250 people taken during the 7 October 2023 attack, when 1,200 people were murdered.  Five swaps have taken place so far, with 21 hostages and more than 730 Palestinian prisoners released. Saturday's exchange was due to involve three more Israelis and hundreds of Palestinians. Defence minister Israel Katz said any delay in releasing hostages would be \"a complete violation\" and he had instructed troops to be on highest alert. The Hostages and Missing Family Forum called on mediating countries to restore the deal, saying \"time is of the essence\" and citing \"the shocking conditions of the hostages released last Saturday\". Read more:Trump plan so outrageous it might be part of something bigger Israeli police confiscate books in raid on Palestinian bookshops As part of the ceasefire deal, Israeli forces pulled back from a key passage through Gaza on Sunday. The four-mile-long Netzarim corridor separates northern Gaza from the south, and hundreds of thousands of displaced Palestinians have now crossed back over. However, Israel pushed back the withdrawal by a few days in protest at the chaotic release of hostages Arbel Yehud and Gadi Moses. This may be what Hamas is referencing what it talks of \"delaying the return of the displaced\".  There have also been examples of Israeli troops shooting at or near Palestinians approaching Israeli forces after being warned to stay back. So far, little progress has been made on an extension to the first six-week phase of the ceasefire. A delegation from Israel has arrived in Qatar for further talks amid concern the deal might collapse before all remaining hostages are freed. Israel has previously said it will not agree to a complete withdrawal from Gaza until Hamas's military and political capabilities are eliminated. Hamas has countered that it will not hand over the final hostages until Israel removes all its troops from Gaza."

The president last week debuted his suggestion to \"own\" Gaza and shut out Hamas while it's redeveloped, but has now contradicted officials who had said any relocation would be temporary. Asked by Fox News if Palestinians could return, he replied: \"No, they wouldn't, because they're going to have much better housing. In other words, I'm talking about building a permanent place for them.\" Trump latest: President signs more executive orders Speaking on Monday at the White House, Mr Trump also suggested the current ceasefire in Gaza should end on Saturday if Hamas does not release hostages as planned. He then went further, saying all the remaining hostages should be released by midday on Saturday, or the ceasefire should be cancelled - and that \"all hell is going to break out\" if the hostages are not freed then. But the US president added: \"I'm speaking for myself. Israel can override it.\" Hamas said earlier it would delay the release of hostages - accusing Israel of violating the ceasefire.  Mr Trump told Fox News his future vision for Gaza was to build multiple \"safe communities, a little bit away from where they are, where all of this danger is\", adding the area is currently \"not habitable\". He said he believed he could cut a deal with Jordan or Egypt to take people in. However, Arab allies - including Egypt and Saudi Arabia - have dismissed the idea of relocating Gaza's two-million-plus population. Western countries have also rejected the proposal; an independent state for Palestinians remains the favoured way forward but is a no-go for the Israeli government. When asked in the media, Palestinians have also rubbished the idea. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has supported Mr Trump's controversial proposal. Much of Gaza lies in ruins due to Israel's attempt to wipe out Hamas after its 2023 terror attack that killed around 1,200 people in Israel. About 250 were also kidnapped, but those still alive have started to be released in recent weeks after a hard-won truce took effect last month. Since the ceasefire began on 19 January, five swaps have taken place - with 16 Israeli and five Thai hostages released. In total, Israel has said it will release up to 1,904 Palestinian prisoners in return for 33 Israeli hostages during the deal's first phase. Read more:Trump plan so outrageous it might be part of something biggerIsraeli police confiscate books in raid on Palestinian bookshops US correspondent From Donald Trump, it's a hardened \"No\". Asked directly if Palestinians would have the right to return to a redeveloped Gaza, he told Fox News Channel's Brett Baier: \"No, they wouldn't, because they're going to have much better housing.\" If the notion of Trump building on Gaza has offended its people, most offensive is the prospect for them of no return. Since Donald Trump first suggested taking and building on Palestinian land, observers in America, the Middle East and all countries in between have been assessing its seriousness.  \n Everything he's said since indicates he's committed both to the project and to ignoring entrenched objections from allies and adversaries alike.\n In spite of flat refusals by Jordan and Egypt to resettle Palestinians in those countries, Trump said: \"I think I could make a deal with Jordan. I think I could make a deal with Egypt. You know, we give them billions and billions of dollars a year.\"\n If peace in the Middle East was a matter of money, it would have been solved long ago. Tuesday's meeting in Washington between Trump and Jordan's King Abdullah won't be easy.  \n In the White House, the Jordanian leader will talk numbers of his own – the hundreds of thousands of Palestinian refugees already living in the Hashemite kingdom and the instability threatened by moving more.   Trump is also due to meet the Egyptian president and the Saudi crown prince in the coming days – it is a chorus of Arab voices to caution an expansionist president at a delicate time, as parties involved in the current conflict work through the phases of a ceasefire deal.   Trump's plan is radical and it invites fresh-eyed debate over a way forward for the region. However, it is the property deal that separates a people from their home – again. At the heart of a radical plan, it's the inherent recklessness.\n So far, little progress has been made on an extension to the first six-week phase of the ceasefire.

        "Content": "\n          International correspondent\n              @sparkomat\n In what will be seen as a signature act of the new Trump administration, the president and his team have denounced and dismembered the US government's international assistance arm, USAID, in a matter of three weeks. It is a decision that will have serious, real-world consequences - and the impact is already being felt in countries such as Uganda. Trump latest: President doubles down on Gaza plan The health ministry in Uganda has announced its intention to shut all dedicated HIV/AIDS and tuberculosis (TB) clinics in the country. Stand-alone pharmacies supplying antiretroviral drugs will also be closed. These facilities provide HIV treatments and preventative therapies to millions of people in Uganda, including an estimated 1.5 million currently living with the virus. An official said the closure of HIV clinics was a necessary response as the country grapples with the loss of funding from USAID. Directors and staff at the country's public hospitals have been instructed to offer the same services at their outpatients and chronic care departments. A USAID initiative called the President's Emergency Plan For AIDS Relief - or PEPFAR - has bankrolled much of Uganda's HIV/AIDS relief plan and it's an initiative that has wielded impressive results. Specially trained staff and dedicated clinics are credited with bringing infection rates down from 19% in the late 1990s to 5% in 2024. 'We are still reeling' Flavia Kyomukama, from the National Forum of People Living with HIV/AIDS Networks Uganda (NAFOPHANU), said she was stunned by Donald Trump's decision. \"We are still reeling from the shock of what they have done, it is very difficult to understand,\" she said. \"There was a memorandum of support [between both countries], there was roadmap [towards zero infections] and they make this decision in a day.\" Shifting HIV/AIDS-related care to public hospitals is deeply problematic, Ms Kyomukama added. These facilities are often overwhelmed, and they offer little, or no, privacy. It is a serious issue in a country where those carrying the virus are badly stigmatised. \"Surveys show 30% of health workers have a negative attitude towards people with HIV,\" Ms Kyomukama said. \"So, we're going to see [patients] dropping out [of their treatment plans], drug resistance will increase and we will see more violence in hospital as people with HIV get attacked.\" International correspondent The Trump administration's destruction of USAID will bring about the virtual collapse of the international aid and development system, experts have warned.  The US government puts far more money into humanitarian assistance than any other country.  In 2023, the most recent year for which data is largely complete, the Americans disbursed $71.9bn (£57bn) in foreign aid, representing 1.2% of total US government spending.  It is a spending commitment that has remained remarkably consistent over the years.  The Americans underwrite programmes in 177 individual countries with Ukraine registering as the biggest recipient in 2023. It received $16.6bn (£12.9bn) to maintain government services after the Russian invasion.  PEPFAR, USAID's best-known initiative, provides antiretroviral treatments to 20 million people infected with HIV/AIDS.  The initiative supports NGO-run groups with an extended workforce of 350,000 people – with many employed at local clinics. The US also bankrolls key UN organisations, such as the refugee agency (UNHCR). Its total budget of $4.8bn (£3.8bn) is propped up by the Americans, who put in US$2bn (£1.6bn).  Without this funding, it is difficult to see how UNHCR can continue to support tens of millions of refugees in countries including Sudan, Syria, Turkey and the Democratic Republic of Congo.  If the residents of refugee camps are not supported with basic services, they are likely to move.  The question then is how US funding compares to other donors – and the answer is startling.  According to the UN's real-time financial tracking service, Germany contributed funds in 2024 representing 8% of total humanitarian aid contributions, as did the European Union, with the United Kingdom at 6%.  The world, then, is worryingly dependent on the United States.  Former international aid worker turned consultant Thomas Byrnes said: \"The modern humanitarian system has been shaped by a long-term commitment from the US.  \"For decades, organisations like the UN agencies have relied on this predictable funding stream to address global crises.  \"The world faces a major shock and I don't think anyone is prepared for it.\" To alleviate the situation, Mr Byrnes said other donors – such as the UK and Germany – will need to make up the funding shortfall from USAID.  But that is highly unlikely to happen.    The United Kingdom, currently contributing $2.1bn (£1.7bn), would need to contribute an additional $1.5bn (£1.2bn) – representing a 74% increase.  For Germany, the required extra contribution would be $1.8bn (£1.5bn), representing a substantial increase of 70%. Furthermore, Trump's move comes at a time when Germany, France, Sweden and others are planning deep cuts to international aid.  The world is looking at a colossal funding gap – and a colossal crisis - as the number of people in need of humanitarian assistance rises to 305 million people, Mr Byrnes added. \"We're facing a perfect storm,\" he said. \"The brutal math means we're heading toward humanitarian aid of just 17 cents per person per day. \"This isn't a funding dip - it's a systemic shock that will force impossible choices about who receives help and who doesn't. People will die as a result of this.\" 'It's total panic right now' Brian Aliganyira is the director of Ark Wellness Hub, a busy health clinic for the LGBT+ community in Uganda's capital, Kampala. The clinic has sourced supplies - such as antiretroviral drugs, preventative 'PrEP' therapies and testing kits - from partners who are underpinned by USAID. Now, the 37-year-old has got a major problem on his hands. \"It's total panic right now,\" he said. \"Our response teams are panicking and there is a lot of panic in the community. \"We are telling people to go home and it's not just [our clinic]. There is no more medication left - or maybe there's one refill at the most. But people keep asking us, 'have you got any extra, any extra'? \"Without the support we need, HIV will surge and people will die.\" 'Lives will be lost' There are some still clinging to hope. On 1 February, US secretary of state Marco Rubio issued a waiver exempting the PEPFAR programme from the new administration's cuts to foreign aid. However, President Trump issued a contradictory order banning programmes designed to \"advance equality and human rights for lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, and intersex people\".

The advert was shown in the Los Angeles area during the big game, but not nationwide. It comes after West deactivated his X account after more antisemitic posts last week. The rapper's final entry stated: \"I'm logging out of Twitter. I appreciate [X owner] Elon [Musk] for allowing me to vent. \"It has been very cathartic to use the world as a sounding board. It was like an Ayahuasca trip.\" \"Love all of you who gave me your energy and attention. To we connect again [sic].

The group said the T-shirt listing was another damning example of West's dangerous prejudice. \"The swastika is the symbol adopted by Hitler as the primary emblem of the Nazis,\" it posted. \"It galvanized his followers in the 20th century and continues to threaten and instil fear in those targeted by antisemitism and white supremacy.\" West - also known as Ye - has been suspended from Twitter at least twice before. In October 2022, his account was restricted over antisemitic comments but he returned the following month. The outcry prompted Adidas to end their lucrative trainer deal. Two months later, he was locked out again after posts including one appearing to show a swastika inside a Star of David.

        "Content": "\n          Economics and data editor\n              @EdConwaySky\n  Few materials matter quite as much as steel and aluminium. Steel, an alloy of iron and carbon, is the main metallic ingredient in the structures we live in and the bridges we build. If it's not made of steel it's made with steel. Aluminium, on the other hand, is a wonder material we use with wild abandon these days. A light metal we use in planes and trains, in the bodies of electric vehicles and in those high voltage power lines we'll need so many of to provide electricity in the coming years. Money blog: The 10 jobs crying out for applicants  All of which is to say these metals are the bedrock for much of the world around us. And like most developed economies, the US is far from independent when it comes to these materials. The degree of dependence on other countries varies between them. According to the US Geological Survey, America's \"net import reliance ratio\" for aluminium is close to 50%, implying it is deeply dependent on imports to satisfy demand among its companies. The degree of dependence is considerably lower for steel - only a little over 10%. At least part of the idea behind tariffs is to bring some production back to the US, but imposing them will have consequences. What kinds of consequences? Well, at its simplest, tariffs push up prices. This is, when you think about it, blindingly obvious. A tariff is a tax on a good entering the country. So if aluminium and steel are going up in price then that means, all else equal, that the cost of making everything from aircraft wings to steel rivets also goes up. That in turn means consumers end up paying the price - and if a company can't make ends meet in the face of these tariffs, it means job losses - possibly within the very industrial sectors the president wants to protect. So says the economic theory. But in practice, economics isn't everything. There are countless examples throughout history of countries defying economic logic in search of other goals. Perhaps they want to improve their national self-reliance in a given product; perhaps they want to ensure certain jobs in cherished areas or industries are protected. But nothing comes for free, and even if Donald Trump's tariffs succeed in persuading domestic producers to smelt more aluminium or steel, such things don't happen overnight. In the short run, it's hard to see how these tariffs wouldn't be significantly inflationary. There's a deeper issue here, which comes back (as so many of Mr Trump's economic measures do) to China. Both the steel and aluminium markets have faced enormous influxes of cheap Chinese metals in recent years - to the extent that in recent months those Chinese imports have actually been cheaper than the cost of production in Europe. To some extent, that's a consequence of high European energy costs, but it's partly down to the fact that China subsidises its producers more than most other countries around the world. Indeed, of all the products in the world, few have had as many cases lodged at the World Trade Organisation as steel. Read more:Why China could benefit most from Trump's tariffsTax hikes and financial gloom 'acting as brakes' on jobs But while it's worth being aware of these dynamics, which are pushing cheap steel into many markets, it's also worth noting that the US actually imports far less from China than you might have thought. The vast majority of American aluminium imports, for instance, come from Canada rather than China. Any tariffs on the metal would further undermine the economic relationship between these parts of North America. Much, of course, now depends on the structure and detail of these tariffs - and the extent to which they're actually implemented. As with his threatened tariffs on Canada and Mexico, these ones raise as many questions as they answer. That is likely to be the way of things for much of this presidential term."

        "Content": "Sir Salman Rushdie was so stunned he didn't try to fight back after a masked man stabbed him on stage, a court has heard.  The 77-year-old author was attacked moments before he was due to present a lecture on keeping writers safe in New York in August 2022. He was left seriously wounded and blind in one eye. Hadi Matar, 27, is now standing trial for attempted murder and assault. He has pleaded not guilty and said \"Free Palestine\" as he was brought into Chautauqua County court in Mayville, New York, on Monday. As the opening statements were delivered, district attorney Jason Schmidt described a sudden attack by Matar - saying he bound up a small staircase and burst onto the stage as the event got under way. Both Sir Salman and fellow speaker Henry Reese - who was also injured - were so stunned by the attack that they initially remained in their seats, the court heard. Mr Schmidt said: \"Without hesitation, this man holding his knife […] forcefully and efficiently in its speed, plunged the knife into Mr Rushdie over and over and over again.\" Matar was \"stabbing, swinging, slicing into Mr Rushdie's head, his throat, his abdomen, his thigh\", Mr Schmidt added. \"It all happened so fast that even the person under attack, Mr Rushdie, and the person sitting next to him, Mr Reese, didn't register what was happening,\" the prosecutor said. More from Sky News:Trump's aid cuts spark 'total panic'Fears over Gaza truce It is believed Sir Salman will testify during the trial, which is expected to last 10 days. The Indian-born British-American author previously detailed the attack - and his long recovery - in his 2024 memoir, Knife: Meditations After An Attempted Murder. The Booker Prize winner had worried for his safety since his 1989 novel The Satanic Verses was labelled blasphemous by many Muslims. The book led to Iran's Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini issuing a fatwa calling for his death and Sir Salman spent years in hiding. He has travelled freely for the past 25 years, after Iran said it would not enforce the decree. The trial is taking place as the 36th anniversary of the fatwa - 14 February - approaches. Jurors will be shown videos and photos of the attack, which ended when onlookers rushed Matar and held him until police arrived. It is unclear what Matar's defence will be."

The US rapper, also known as Ye, was criticised for posting \"hate-filled\" remarks about Jewish people. On Friday many of his posts centred on the Jewish community and he said \"I love Hitler\" and \"I'm a Nazi\". Another post said: \"I'm never apologising for my Jewish comments.\" Following the posts, West's account had a \"sensitive content warning\" added to it. But the 47-year-old now appears to have deleted his X account. \"I'm logging out of Twitter,\" he wrote. \"I appreciate [X owner] Elon [Musk] for allowing me to vent. \"It has been very cathartic to use the world as a sounding board.

Rapper has had account suspended before It comes after West and his wife Bianca Censori caused controversy at the Grammy Awards when she wore a transparent dress on the red carpet as he stood by her. The rapper has had his X account suspended at least twice in the past. In October 2022, West's account was restricted over antisemitic comments, but he returned to the platform the following month. He also made antisemitic remarks that led Adidas to cut ties with him. In December 2022 it was suspended after he made antisemitic comments and praised Hitler. At the time Mr Musk said the account would be suspended after Kanye posted an image appearing to show a swastika inside a Star of David. He said the suspension was \"for incitement to violence\". The account was unsuspended by July 2023."

The petition urges the New York auction house to call off the event - where pieces range from $10,000 to $250,000 (£8,000 to £202,000) - citing \"serious concern\" over exploitation of artists. \"Many of the artworks you plan to auction were created using AI models that are known to be trained on copyrighted work without a licence,\" the petition says. \"These models, and the companies behind them, exploit human artists, using their work without permission or payment to build commercial AI products that compete with them.\" The petition, directed at Christie's, reads: \"Your support of these models, and the people who use them, rewards and further incentivises AI companies' mass theft of human artists' work. \"We ask that, if you have any respect for human artists, you cancel the auction.\" The battleground over training AI models has resulted in a number of lawsuits between companies and creatives alleging copyright was breached in the training process. Christie's said the works in the auction used AI to \"enhance\" the art. Concerns 'completely justified' One of the petition's leading signatories, British composer Ed Newton-Rex, told Sky News he thinks the letter is \"completely justified\". He said: \"It looks like around nine of the works in the auction were made using AI models that companies built using other artists' work without permission. \"I don't blame artists for using AI products that are available on the market, but I question why Christie's would implicitly condone these models by selling these works for tens or hundreds of thousands of dollars, when the exploitative technology behind them is impoverishing so many artists desperately trying to make a living.\" 'Bullying' artists The AI-dedicated event, running from 20 February to 5 March, includes work by Refik Anadol, Claire Silver, Sasha Stiles and others. Mat Dryhurst, a British artist whose work features in Christie's auction, told Sky News he did not agree with the artists speaking out against Christie's. He said he \"does not find attempts to bully artists in the least bit acceptable\".He added: \"It is not illegal to use any model to create artwork. \"I resent that an important debate that should be focused on companies and state policy is being focused on artists grappling with the technology of our time.\" Read more:AI summit: rift between regulation and innovation'Godfather' of AI warns arms race risks A spokesperson for Christie's told Sky News: \"The artists represented in this sale all have strong, existing multidisciplinary art practices, some recognised in leading museum collections. \"The works in this auction are using artificial intelligence to enhance their bodies of work.\""

Low rates of gas storage in Britain and across Europe, combined with cold weather, have increased demand for gas to heat homes. It's brought the price up to 140 pence a therm (a unit of heat used to measure gas), a high not seen since January 2023. Higher gas prices can bring up household bills as electricity costs are linked to wholesale costs. Money blog: The 10 jobs crying out for applicants Britain is reliant on European gas imports and has less storage capacity than its neighbours. Last month, the owner of Britain's largest gas storage site said levels in the country were \"concerningly low\". European storage levels have been depleted by cold weather and are now at approximately 50% capacity, well below the roughly 70% level recorded this time last year. Gas is bought during cheaper periods, including when demand is lower in the summer, and then stored for use during times of high demand. Britain is still reliant on the fossil fuel to generate electricity and heat homes and so is vulnerable to volatile prices.  Global trade tensions have stoked fears of more supply shocks. On Monday, China slapped a 15% tariff on US gas in response to Donald Trump's tax on Chinese imports. Since Russia's invasion of Ukraine three years ago gas costs have increased as Europe sought to limit its use of Russian supplies. Russia, however, remains a key source of gas for the continent. Already expensive bills  Energy bills have already been going up. At the start of last month, energy regulator Ofgem brought up the energy price cap, which limits the unit cost of energy, amid forecasts of a further rise in April. The energy price cap is revised every three months. A final decision on the cap for April, May and June will be made on 25 February."

        "Content": "\n          Economics and data editor\n              @EdConwaySky\n  Few materials matter quite as much as steel and aluminium. Steel, an alloy of iron and carbon, is the main metallic ingredient in the structures we live in and the bridges we build. If it's not made of steel it's made with steel. Aluminium, on the other hand, is a wonder material we use with wild abandon these days. A light metal we use in planes and trains, in the bodies of electric vehicles and in those high voltage power lines we'll need so many of to provide electricity in the coming years. Money blog: The 10 jobs crying out for applicants  All of which is to say these metals are the bedrock for much of the world around us. And like most developed economies, the US is far from independent when it comes to these materials. The degree of dependence on other countries varies between them. According to the US Geological Survey, America's \"net import reliance ratio\" for aluminium is close to 50%, implying it is deeply dependent on imports to satisfy demand among its companies. The degree of dependence is considerably lower for steel - only a little over 10%. At least part of the idea behind tariffs is to bring some production back to the US, but imposing them will have consequences. What kinds of consequences? Well, at its simplest, tariffs push up prices. This is, when you think about it, blindingly obvious. A tariff is a tax on a good entering the country. So if aluminium and steel are going up in price then that means, all else equal, that the cost of making everything from aircraft wings to steel rivets also goes up. That in turn means consumers end up paying the price - and if a company can't make ends meet in the face of these tariffs, it means job losses - possibly within the very industrial sectors the president wants to protect. So says the economic theory. But in practice, economics isn't everything. There are countless examples throughout history of countries defying economic logic in search of other goals. Perhaps they want to improve their national self-reliance in a given product; perhaps they want to ensure certain jobs in cherished areas or industries are protected. But nothing comes for free, and even if Donald Trump's tariffs succeed in persuading domestic producers to smelt more aluminium or steel, such things don't happen overnight. In the short run, it's hard to see how these tariffs wouldn't be significantly inflationary. There's a deeper issue here, which comes back (as so many of Mr Trump's economic measures do) to China. Both the steel and aluminium markets have faced enormous influxes of cheap Chinese metals in recent years - to the extent that in recent months those Chinese imports have actually been cheaper than the cost of production in Europe. To some extent, that's a consequence of high European energy costs, but it's partly down to the fact that China subsidises its producers more than most other countries around the world. Indeed, of all the products in the world, few have had as many cases lodged at the World Trade Organisation as steel. Read more:Why China could benefit most from Trump's tariffsTax hikes and financial gloom 'acting as brakes' on jobs But while it's worth being aware of these dynamics, which are pushing cheap steel into many markets, it's also worth noting that the US actually imports far less from China than you might have thought. The vast majority of American aluminium imports, for instance, come from Canada rather than China. Any tariffs on the metal would further undermine the economic relationship between these parts of North America. Much, of course, now depends on the structure and detail of these tariffs - and the extent to which they're actually implemented. As with his threatened tariffs on Canada and Mexico, these ones raise as many questions as they answer. That is likely to be the way of things for much of this presidential term."

There are no exceptions. This is an across-the-board levy. Canada, Mexico, and Brazil will be hit hard as major steel exporting countries. In Asia the news will rattle South Korea, Vietnam, Australia, and Japan who are significant steel exporters to the US. Trump tariffs - US trade war latest Australia has already said it will try to negotiate an exemption, and it won't be alone. Talking directly to the US and presenting a case that these tariffs are not in the US national interest is the only way to get Trump to back down. Each country will have to find a way to stand up to the US and fight its corner. Until now, the Trump tariffs have targeted specific countries, with 10% on China and an initial 25% for Canada and Mexico. China has retaliated with 10-15% tariffs on crude oil, liquified natural gas, coal, farm machinery and pick-up trucks. However, it's also chosen other levers to pull, restricting access to 25 critical minerals and sanctioning several US companies. President Trump and China's President Xi Jinping are due to speak on the phone. Trump has said he's in no rush to have the call. It's not known when it will happen. What could China offer Mr Trump in return? He may want their help to pressure Russia to end the war in Ukraine. It's unclear whether President Xi would be prepared to do that. While the West is bogged down and distracted by a war in Ukraine and a global trade war, China can focus on its national priorities without interference. There is also another opportunity for China here. It wants to present itself as a stable and reliable trading partner to \"Global South\" countries.

        "Content": "\n          Science and Technology reporter\n       Heads of state and tech bosses are gathering, with some trying to break US and Chinese dominance in artificial intelligence. Top government officials and scientists from around 100 countries are gathering in Paris for the AI Action Summit, which will discuss the future of artificial intelligence. Co-hosted by India's Narendra Modi, the summit's guests also include US vice president JD Vance, Canada's Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and China's deputy leader Zhang Guoqing. It's Mr Vance's first overseas trip in his new position, but many of the summit's attendees, including Mr Modi, are hoping to break his country's dominance in artificial intelligence. The ten biggest AI companies in the world are based in the US including Apple, Nvidia, Microsoft, Oracle, Meta and Alphabet. A fortnight ago, Chinese company DeepSeek also threw the industry into chaos when it revealed an AI model more powerful than ChatGPT and made for a fraction of the cost, showing just how powerful China could be in the industry. Mr Modi has said he intends to bring a wider range of people into AI development and prevent the sector from becoming a US-China battle. His foreign secretary Vikram Misri also stressed the need for equitable access to AI to avoid \"perpetuating a digital divide that is already existing across the world\". Analysis:Paris summit shows dangers of AI race Innovation, regulation and the challenges of embracing AI However, breaking US dominance may be easier said than done, especially for countries with stricter AI regulation. President Trump has already torn up rules imposed by Joe Biden, saying they \"hinder[ed] AI innovation and impose[d] onerous and unnecessary government control over the development of AI\". That's a sentiment echoed by big tech bosses. \"If we want growth, jobs and progress, we must allow innovators to innovate, builders to build and developers to develop,\" Sam Altman, chief executive of OpenAI, wrote in Le Monde ahead of the summit. \"There's a lot of complicated questions to resolve\" around issues like the ability to control AI systems, said Sir Demis Hassabis, founder of Google DeepMind, at the summit. \"But also I think even more complicated are maybe the geopolitical questions about things like regulation.\" Companies in EU countries, for example, may find it harder to innovate than those in the US or China after the EU introduced the AI Safety Bill last year, which imposes strict restrictions on how AI can be used in the region. The UK also has guidelines around how AI can be used, but in January, Sir Keir Starmer promised to \"mainline AI into the veins\" of the country, saying AI could bring £47bn to the economy every year. As well as politicians, the tech world's elite are in the French capital, with Mr Altman, Microsoft president Brad Smith and Google chief executive Sundar Pichai among the big names attending. What keeps AI experts awake at night Yoshua Bengio, known as one of the \"godfathers of AI\", will also speak at the event. The scientist recently said he is \"kept awake at night\" by the fear that humans may build systems \"smarter than us that we don't know how to control\". Protecting people from unregulated AI is one of the topics up for discussion at the conference but a leaked draft of the document that will be signed by attending countries tomorrow doesn't appear to mention mitigating AI's risks. Read more:UK to 'lose AI leadership' without data strategyHow to protect your privacy from AI  One attendee, MIT professor Max Tegmark who is the president of the Future of Life Institute, urged countries not to sign the document. \"To reap unimaginable benefits without endangering millions of livelihoods and lives, AI needs binding safety standards - like we have for every other industry,\" he said in a statement to Sky News. \"This is supported by history, science, public opinion and common-sense. This critical moment calls for courageous leaders who take action - not ones who bury their heads in the sand to appease Big Tech. \"Countries should not sign it.\""

The Recruitment and Employment Confederation (REC) and KPMG's latest snapshot on recruitment found permanent staff vacancies declined at the steepest rate since August 2020 last month. \"Consultants reported redundancies at clients, and that the higher cost of employing staff related to government policies had continued to weigh on hiring activity,\" the study said. Money latest: What it's really like being a butcher \"Temp billings were especially hard hit, falling at the fastest rate since June 2020.\" Neil Carberry, REC's chief executive, said firms were taking a \"wait and see\" approach to hiring until momentum in theeconomy picked up. \"It takes time, and real action, to build business confidence,\" he said. \n                  Trump latest: US president to impose steel tariffs - and signs executive orders on plastic straws and bribery rules\n                 \n                  Gas prices at a two-year high, putting pressure on already expensive energy bills\n                 \n                  Trump's steel and aluminium tariffs target a deeper issue - but risk job losses and higher prices\n                 \"An autumn of fiscal gloom, difficulty navigating significant upcoming tax rises... are all acting as brakes on progress.\" The government warned of a \"tough\" budget ahead shortly after winning the election last July, claiming the Conservatives had left behind a £22bn black hole in the public finances. October's budget placed business on the hook for £25bn of £40bn in tax hikes, with the lion's share coming from adjustments to employer national insurance contributions from April. Business groups responded by warning the bill would hit investment and hiring. The additional costs could also be passed on in the form of higher prices, they said.  Official figures released last month showed a decline in the number of payrolled employees had help push the country's jobless rate up to 4.4%. The data was the first to cover the month of November which followed the budget. Private sector surveys since have suggested a pick up in redundancies, with more recent S&P Global purchasing managers' index readings showing the pace of job cuts at its highest level in four years.  Sainsbury's and BP are among major employers to have announced job losses since the budget. The Treasury has consistently argued that the budget tax measures were a one-off to help fix the public finances and allow for long overdue investment in public services. Its growth agenda, which includes not only infrastructure and green energy investment but also planning reforms to help get the country building, is expected by economists to only make a significantly positive contribution during the second half of the parliament. Last week, the Bank of England slashed its forecast for UK growth this year from 1.5% to 0.75% as it expected the national insurance rise to weigh on activity, in particular by pulling down employment. It said it was too early to gauge the potential threats from trade tariffs imposed, and threatened, by Donald Trump in the United States - but warned that such protectionism was generally negative for economic growth."

        "Content": "\n          Science and technology editor\n              @t0mclark3\n The AI Action Summit is arguably a coming together of the most powerful people in the world. Sure, political representatives from all our major economies are convening here in Paris. But in the age of artificial intelligence, it's the big tech companies who own the powerful AI models, as well as the hardware and expertise to design and build them, that also wield true power. In late 2023, the UK government convened the first international AI summit at Bletchley Park near London. Its focus was supposedly on AI safety and how governments could ensure their citizens' jobs, or even lives, weren't threatened by the rapid rise of superintelligent AI that tech bosses assured them was just around the corner. But the undercurrent was very much political leaders trying to figure out how to capitalise on the advantages AI will undoubtedly bring. Things are different now. Donald Trump has vowed to make the US the world's AI superpower. Almost as soon as the words left his mouth, however, a Chinese company, DeepSeek, proved that it could rival American \"big tech\" despite strict controls on leading AI hardware. It's no accident that China, which remained on the sidelines of previous summits, has sent vice premier Zhang Guoqing - seen as President Xi Jinping's right-hand man. JD Vance is also making his first overseas trip as US vice president in order to attend the summit. French President Emmanuel Macron is keen to steer the conversation away from the risks of a race towards computer superintelligence and towards how AI tools can be used for things societies need, such as curing disease and improving public services. Read more from Sky News:Trump to impose tariffs on all steel and aluminium importsLabour MP 'deeply regrets' WhatsApp commentsMore than 600 immigration arrests in January The big tech firms want to talk about that too, and how Mr Trump's plans for the lightest-touch regulation are the only way to ensure the AI innovation that governments want. Mr Macron wants leaders to commit to a political declaration around ethical, democratic and environmental principles when it comes to AI. But a leaked draft of the text makes little mention of safety. That is at odds with the EU's tougher regulatory stance on AI - and the views of many AI experts on the sidelines of this summit. They continue to warn of the dangers of a big tech oligopoly on AI. They also warn of the risks of their role, deliberate or not, in a geopolitical race for AI supremacy that leaders like Donald Trump and Xi Jinping are likely to pursue."

        "Content": "\n          City editor\n              @MarkKleinmanSky\n The FTSE-100 consumer goods giant Unilever is closing in on a £230m deal to snap up Wild, a premium producer of refillable personal care products backed by the founders of Innocent Drinks. Sky News has learnt that Unilever has agreed the terms of a transaction to acquire Wild from its founders and early-stage investors. A deal could be announced within weeks, according to industry sources. If confirmed, it would be one of Unilever's most significant acquisitions in the personal care space for some years, and comes as chief executive Hein Schumacher accelerates efforts to revamp its portfolio. Money blog: The 10 most in-demand jobs in 2025 The group owns personal care brands such as Dove and Lynx - which is known as Axe in most countries around the world. Unilever is said to have been drawn to the Wild business because of both its premium brand positioning and its commitment to sustainability. \n                  Trump latest: US president to impose steel tariffs - and signs executive orders on plastic straws and bribery rules\n                 \n                  Gas prices at a two-year high, putting pressure on already expensive energy bills\n                 \n                  Trump's steel and aluminium tariffs target a deeper issue - but risk job losses and higher prices\n                 Wild, which was founded by Charlie Bowes-Lyon and Freddy Ward, sells refillable natural deodorants, lip balms, bodywashes and handwashes direct to consumers. The sale price of up to £230m is understood to include a sizeable earnout for the founders, but even without that, the deal represents a remarkable triumph for a business founded just six years ago. Mr Ward told The Grocer, a trade magazine, in 2023 that Wild's initial efforts to produce a credible product were unsuccessful. \"We learned that we weren't very good at making deodorant but there was demand for the product if we could get it right,\" he said. \"It just didn't really work, was the problem. \"The formulation wasn't very good.\" A revamp of the product, which coincided with the remote shopping explosion triggered by the COVID-19 crisis, paid dividends for the founders. Since then, they have reportedly raised in the region of £10m from external investors including Jamjar Ventures, the investment vehicle of Innocent Drinks' founders, Redbus Ventures and Slingshot Ventures. Its accounts for the year to 31 December 2023 show that sales reached close to £47m, a 77% increase on the year before. It recorded an operating profit of £560,000. \"2023 represented a watershed moment in Wild's short history as we delivered our first year of profitable growth across the business,\" the accounts - signed off last July - said. A sale to Unilever comes as the London-listed group contemplates a listing of its vast ice cream division, which includes the Ben & Jerry's brand. The company is being lobbied to demerge in a deal involving the London Stock Exchange, although exchanges in Amsterdam and New York are also under consideration. On Monday afternoon, shares in Unilever were trading at around £47.26, giving it a market capitalisation of close to £116bn. Unilever declined to comment, while Wild Cosmetics had no means of being immediately reached for comment."

        "Content": "\n          Business and economics reporter\n              @SkyNewsBiz\n The contribution to energy bills from a government deal with a biomass electricity provider will fall in the coming years as subsidies are cut under a new agreement. The Department for Energy Security and Net Zero (DESNZ) revealed consumers would save £170m per year under a new deal with Drax covering 2027-2031. That projection is based on the halving of the North Yorkshire power station's government subsidy in that time. Money latest: Costco membership 'shake-up' DESNZ said Drax would also play a much more limited role in the power system in that time, providing electricity only when it is really needed compared to current generation averaging around two-thirds of a year. Drax, a former coal-fired plant which now burns wood pellets, is paid to generate energy using wood that must be 70% sustainable. That sustainability figure will rise to 100% by 2027 under the new deal. \n                  Power giant Drax told by own advisers to stop calling biomass 'carbon neutral' \n                 \n                  Criminal proceedings against Drax over 'harmful' dust exposure dropped following new evidence\n                 \n                  Drax: Subsidies for power giant questioned as annual profits soar\n                 Its operations are classed, controversially, as renewable in the UK because the emissions released from burning the wood can be reabsorbed by new trees that grow in the place of those burned. Drax is currently classed as Britain's largest renewable power generator by output as it has the capacity to power the equivalent of five million homes. The company, which has previously been fined for misreporting data on wood it has used and criticised over its CO2 emissions, also operates hydro power projects.  The government is aiming to decarbonise the power sector by 2030. Meeting this target will require a large increase in renewable energy, such as wind and solar, as well as projectsthat store energy for when there is insufficient wind or sun. Ministers say a new energy mix, that cuts the country's reliance on internationally priced gas, will not only bring down bills in future but guarantee domestic power supplies. While biomass is the lowest cost option in the short term, without extra technology to capture carbon emissions from burning wood, it is not seen as a long-term solution. New nuclear is part of the equation. DESNZ said: \"This government will do whatever it takes to deliver energy security and protect billpayers now and into the future\". Drax shares rose by 6% on news of the new settlement which guarantees the Selby power station's future. Read more from Sky News:Trump says he'll impose 25% tariffs on steel and aluminium imports into USBudget tax hikes and financial gloom 'acting as brakes' on employment Group chief executive Will Gardiner said: \"The government's low-carbon dispatchable CfD framework for biomass, announced today, is an investment in UK energy security, which will result in a net saving for consumers and support the delivery of Clean Power 2030. \"Analysis from Baringa indicates the proposed agreement will result in a £1.6-3.1bn reduction in electricity system costs, versus the construction of new fossil fuel power stations, and government has concluded today that Drax offers the lowest cost option for bill payers during this period.\" He added: \"Under this proposed agreement, Drax can step in to increase generation when there is not enough electricity, helping to avoid the need to burn more gas or import power from Europe, and when there is too much electricity on the UK grid, Drax can turn down and help to balance the system. \"The size, flexibility and location of the power station makes it important for UK energy security and the proposed agreement helps protect the jobs and skills of today and the future, creating options for billions of pounds of investment in growth across Britain, including the development of large-scale carbon removals and data centres.\""

It's no surprise that Andrew Gwynne was sacked before the story of his outrageous comments on WhatsApp had even been published, given that Sir Keir has built his leadership of the party on the promise to root out antisemitism. Labour ministers sent out to bat for the party have highlighted that decisiveness as evidence of the PM's determination to hold its representatives to the highest possible standards. Once it emerged that there was a second Labour MP in that toxic WhatsApp group, Oliver Ryan, it was surely only a matter of time before he faced his own retribution. Politics latest: Diane Abbott condemns WhatsApp chat We've only seen a handful of the messages sent by the 29-year-old Burnley MP, as published in today's Daily Mail. He was a 23-year-old councillor when the group was set up - and while clearly highly inappropriate, his comments are not in the same league as those of his former boss, Andrew Gwynne. But it also seems clear he failed to challenge, let alone report, what was going on. In his statement last night Mr Ryan said he fully condemns the \"unacceptable\" comments made in the group, that he regrets not speaking out at the time, recognises that failing to do so was wrong, and apologised for his own comments. It was a much more heartfelt, detailed mea culpa than Mr Gwynne's apology for \"any offensive I've caused\" and description of \"badly misjudged comments\". But the party leadership wants to make it abundantly clear that the offensive comments in the group, and the offensive attitudes fuelling them, are utterly condemned.

The danger for Number 10 is if there is anything more to emerge both from the cache of messages, and whether substantial previous concerns had been raised about the individuals involved. Sir Keir will be hoping his rapid response will have taken the heat out of the scandal, and limited the damage to the party's reputation. But there's no doubt the damage has been done."

The Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority (IPSA) has proposed a 2.8% pay rise for MPs for the next financial year from April. This would take their annual pay from £91,346 to £93,904 and represents a rise of nearly £20,000 over the past 10 years. MPs also claim expenses for their staff, office costs, accommodation and travel. Politics latest: Labour MP facing suspension over WhatsApp messages IPSA said the increase is \"in line with government pay recommendations for public sector workers\". Its proposal will go to consultation. However, since IPSA was set up in 2011 in response to the 2009 MPs' expenses scandal, all its recommendations for MPs' pay have been accepted. The rise is above inflation which stands at 2.5% - above the Bank of England's 2% target. IPSA said it considers a range of metrics when deciding MPs' pay, including national pay statistics, rewards in the public sector, its own pay principles and the wider economic context. Richard Lloyd, IPSA's chair, said: \"Our aim has been to make fair decisions on pay, both for MPs and the public. \"Our pay proposal for 2025-26 reflects the experience of the wider working public sector population, and recognises both the vital role of MPs and the current economic climate.\" Read more from Sky News:Labour MP 'deeply regrets' WhatsApp commentsMore than 600 immigration arrests in January IPSA has to review MPs' salaries within the first year of a new parliament.

It will have to review pay again in July - and will carry out a wider consultation on how MPs' pay is set to determine how much they should be paid from 2026. Last year, MPs had a 5.5% salary increase."

The Reform UK leader was speaking before a large tractor protest outside the Houses of Parliament this morning. He added that future protests would put pressure on Number 10 if they see \"local communities getting behind these families\" who will be impacted by the changes. Labour has insisted it will not make a U-turn on its plans to introduce a 20% inheritance tax rate on farms worth more than £1m. The changes announced in the budget are due to come into force in April 2026 and scrap an exemption which meant no inheritance tax was paid to pass down family farms. Monday's rally, organised by Save British Farming, comes as MPs debate an e-petition with more than 148,000 signatures that calls for the current inheritance tax exemptions for working farms to be kept. Speaking at a Farmers To Action campaign event in north London before the protest in Westminster, Mr Farage said: \"I'm pleased to see the campaign is ramping up. It's growing right across the country.\" He added: \"The message I've been putting to them, I think they're listening to, which is 100 Labour MPs now represent rural seats - if they see local communities getting behind these families, they're going to start getting scared, and they're going to start putting pressure on No 10, and let's face it, they're in pretty big trouble already. \"So I think if this campaign is persistent and peaceful, they can get change.\" Read more on tax changes for farms:Most farmers unaffected by tax changes - IFSMore farms could be hit than government said - analysis Mr Farage, who was joined at the event by professional boxer Derek Chisora, said the protesters had been \"behaving impeccably\" and should continue to be \"voluble, but peaceful within the law\". Mr Farage also advocated \"just getting rid of inheritance tax as a whole\". \"You're basically taxing money that's been taxed already as a death tax, and it's horrible,\" he said. \"People living in semi-detached houses in London are now dragged into inheritance tax.

        "Content": "\n          Chief political correspondent\n              @joncraig\n Parliament's most famous bar, Strangers, is to re-open after being closed last month following a drink-spiking allegation. The bar, used by MPs and their guests, peers, parliamentary staff and political journalists, was closed on Monday 20 January. Sky News understands it is now likely to re-open after Parliament's half-term recess, on Monday 24 February, meaning it will have been shut for five weeks. The decision to re-open was taken at a secret meeting of the House of Commons Commission, chaired by Speaker Sir Lindsay Hoyle. \"The commission will be providing an update shortly,\" a source told Sky News. That update could come as early as later this week. Politics latest:Abbott condemns 'racist and sexist' Labour WhatsApp chat The bar was closed after a parliamentary researcher complained her drink had been spiked. The woman told bar staff and security personnel the drink had been tampered with. The alleged incident, said to have taken place at about 6.30pm on Tuesday 7 January, in the first week after Parliament returned from recess, prompted a police inquiry. A Metropolitan Police spokesman confirmed an investigation had been launched and the victim was being supported. No arrests have been made, however. The decision to close the bar was taken by Sir Lindsay, in consultation with the clerk of the House, Tom Goldsmith, and the director of parliamentary security, Alison Giles. Announcing the closure on Friday 17 January , a House of Commons spokesperson said: \"Strangers' Bar will close from Monday 20 January while security and safety arrangements are reviewed. \"The safety of everyone on the estate remains a key priority of both Houses.\" Read more:The Commons venue that changed political historyMPs set for above inflation pay rise to nearly £94,000 It has been reported that one result of the review will be CCTV cameras being installed in the bar.

It is made up of seven MPs, including the Speaker, and four lay members. The other MPs are Commons Leader Lucy Powell, the Tories' shadow leader Jesse Norman, Labour MPs Rachel Blake and Nick Smith, former Tory cabinet minister Steve Barclay and Lib Dem MP Maria Goldman."

        "Content": "\n          Scotland reporter\n              @Jenster13\n A Scottish Conservative MSP has denied using artificial intelligence to make almost 1,000 parliamentary questions as he faces accusations of wasting £100,000 of taxpayers' money. Douglas Lumsden has been urged to apologise and pay back the cost of the 987 queries submitted in January. The questions included demanding to know the number of sauce and salt and pepper sachets at Holyrood, and how many straws the Scottish government had procured in the last 10 years. The SNP said other questions lodged included how many Scottish parliament flags had gone missing over the past decade, the number of flagpoles owned and their height. The MSP for North East Scotland also queried the average profit or loss on jars of honey sold in the Holyrood shop, as well as how it is verified that the beeswax used for the Great Seal of Scotland comes from the parliament's bees. Written questions are a way of obtaining information for the public and scrutinising the work of both the government and parliament. Scottish government officials say the most recent exercise to estimate the price of answering a parliamentary question was conducted in 2008 and reported the cost to be £98.51. That is now likely to be substantially higher. Mr Lumsden denied using AI but said he would \"look at any new tools to hold the government to account\". He added: \"So far these questions have discovered that there has been no growth of surgical training posts in the last 10 years, no forensic pathologists based in Aberdeen, and the incident statistics on the A96. \"They have also discovered the number of repairs at the Toll of Birness, the cost of the overseas embassies, the number of signs and streetlights being replaced each year on the A90, the cost of Scottish government electricity over five years, and the fleet size and value, and number of Teslas owned by the Scottish government.\" Read more from Sky News:MPs set for above inflation pay rise to nearly £94,000The 10 most in-demand jobs in 2025  The politician noted that Scottish Labour MSPs Monica Lennon and Jackie Baillie had both asked more questions than him this parliamentary term. Mr Lumsden added: \"I will continue to ask questions to hold this rotten government to account and won't be silenced when it comes to standing up for the northeast.\" Scottish Labour did not wish to comment on Mr Lumsden's statement. Meanwhile, SNP MSP Kevin Stewart branded Mr Lumsden's questions \"frivolous\" and suggested he should apologise and refund the cost of his queries. Mr Stewart added: \"MSPs have a duty to hold the government and parliament to account but this incredible volume of questions is a flagrant disregard for the taxpayers' cash. \"In a cost of living crisis voters will rightly be asking what on earth he is up to.\""

The Labour government points out this was a 73% increase compared to January last year - when the Conservatives were in power - and 352 arrests were made across 556 visits. Labour have been emphasising border security since its election, recognising that the topic is one of the most important to voters - and not wanting to lose ground to the Tories or Reform UK. Some 3,930 arrests have been made over 5,424 visits by immigration enforcement officers since July when Labour took over, according to Home Office figures. The number of arrests highlighted today happened after a series of raids at businesses like restaurants, takeaways, cafes, car washes, nail bars and vape shops. In total, Labour said that more than 16,400 people have been deported since the election - and the government says this number is expected to go up later on Monday when new data is published.

Civil penalty referral notices were also made to employers. Upon entering government, Labour immediately scrapped the Rwanda deportation scheme championed by various Conservative prime ministers. The roughly 1,000 transferred staff that had been working on the programme have instead been used to help with the enforcement of immigration rules.  The Conservatives still claim that the Rwanda scheme would work as a \"deterrent\" for illegal migrants. Other measures the government has taken include launching adverts in Vietnam and Albania to dissuade potential migrants, and working with other countries to try to prevent people coming to the UK illegally. In March, the UK will host a border security summit - with the government claiming more than 40 countries will come together alongside bodies like the EU to discuss illegal migration.

But the bill has been criticised by Conservative opponents. 👉 Click here to listen to Electoral Dysfunction on your podcast app 👈 Chris Philp MP, shadow home secretary, called it a \"weak bill that won't stop the boats\". \"Shockingly, the bill also restores an illegal migrant's capability to claim indefinite leave to remain,\" he added. \"This follows new research showing that if Labour don't back the plan set out by Kemi Badenoch and the Conservatives, millions more migrants could obtain ILR (indefinite leave to remain), costing the taxpayer £234bn. That is why Labour must back our amendment. \"Under new leadership, the Conservatives are coming up with effective and deliverable reforms to cut immigration. Our country is our home, not a hotel.\""

        "Content": "\n          Political reporter\n              @alixculbertson\n Farmers are being forced to choose between protecting the environment or their legacy by the introduction of inheritance tax, a lawyer who worked on a key green farming policy has told Sky News. Richard Broadbent, a former lawyer at government adviser Natural England, said the government had created a \"chilling effect\" on nature recovery schemes by making farmers pay inheritance tax while also expecting them to give over land to create and improve natural habitats. Chancellor Rachel Reeves announced at the October budget farmers will have to pay 20% inheritance tax on farms worth more than £1m from April 2026. All farms were previously exempt. Those in favour of the change say it will significantly reduce the use of agricultural property for large-scale tax avoidance, ensure a closer relationship between the agricultural and market values of land, and create a greater diversity of land ownership. But the move has been condemned by farmers who again took to Whitehall in their tractors on Monday in protest. The Country Land and Business Association (CLA), which represents 26,000 landowners and rural business owners, said the government was \"taxing the future of farming, food security, and the environment itself\". Mr Broadbent, now an environmental lawyer at Freeth's, worked with Natural England's legal team on the biodiversity net gain (BNG) policy, introduced by the Conservatives, which means new property developments in England, as of February 2024, must result in more or better quality natural habitat than before development. \n                  Politics latest: PM told to get close to EU after 'really alarming' Trump tariffs - as second Labour MP suspended over WhatsApp chat\n                 \n                  Starmer will hope he can draw a line under damage of WhatsApp scandal after second MP's suspension\n                 \n                  MPs set for above inflation pay rise to nearly £94,000\n                 This mainly involves developers paying landowners, often farmers, to turn over their land to nature, which could involve establishing grassland and woodlands or creating nature habitat banks. Agreements are made for at least 30 years and could be decades longer, as it can take that long to establish nature recovery schemes. Farmers will 'think twice' Mr Broadbent said because many farmers were now considering giving parts of their land to other family members to avoid paying inheritance tax, this could have a detrimental effect on BNG. \"If you're a farmer and thinking of parcelling up your land to various family members seeking more tax efficiencies, or if you're worried when you die they will have to break up the farm to pay for inheritance tax, you're going to think twice about entering into a long-term nature recovery scheme,\" he said. \"You're also getting private sector money and they're going to want to know that you're going to be able to adhere to the contract as well.\" He said inheritance tax and the environmental incentives were \"creating a conflict which doesn't seem very sensible\". Read more:Inheritance tax could affect five times more farms than Treasury saysFarmers in 'catch-22' as investing in environmental schemes could push up land value Victoria Vyvyan, president of the CLA told Sky News: \"The government is forcing farmers to choose between keeping their land and investing in its future. Many are thinking twice before investing in environmental work like agri-environment schemes because they might result in lower productivity. Every spare penny must be saved for the Treasury. \"The anti-growth message is clear: don't spend, don't invest, don't improve - just save money to keep the farm in the family. \"The Treasury has barely accounted for the economic damage of this policy, let alone the harm to the land itself. They aren't just taxing land values, they are taxing the future of farming, food security, and the environment itself.\"  Environmental schemes could push land values up There is also concern nature recovery schemes will increase the value of farmland, which could push farms over the inheritance tax threshold or mean families have to pay more. \"We want to be getting the best nature on our land with the investment we're putting into it,\" Mr Broadbent said. \"But if you're a farmer you're worried that that's going to inflate your tax bill. Again, we've created a chilling effect on that.\"  More intensive farming Another worry is farmers will intensively farm the land they already have instead of purchasing more land to grow the same amount of crops or keep livestock as they do not want to push the value of their farm up. Intensive farming has been associated with river pollution, poor animal welfare and public health concerns. \"People will want to more intensively farm to get more money out per hectare so they have the cash available when they need to,\" Mr Broadbent added. \"It's a natural response but that's the kind of incentives it's giving people.\" Sky News has contacted the government for a comment."

        "Content": "A group led by Elon Musk has made a $97.4bn (£78.7bn) bid to buy OpenAI just months after the X owner sued the artificial intelligence start-up. Mr Musk co-founded OpenAI with its current chief executive Sam Altman in 2015, but left before the company took off after it released ChatGPT in late 2022. Initially launched as a non-profit, OpenAI is currently transitioning to a for-profit model - which it says it needs to do so it can afford to develop the best AI models. Mr Musk disagrees with the move and said in a press release about the bid: \"It's time for OpenAI to return to the open-source, safety-focused force for good it once was. \"We will make sure that happens.\" The offer is being backed by Mr Musk's rival artificial intelligence company xAI, which could merge with OpenAI following a deal, according to the Wall Street Journal, which first reported the bid. OpenAI was valued at $157bn (£127bn) in its latest funding round in October last year. A deal of this size would require the investing group to raise enormous funds. Mr Musk's offer appears to have escalated longstanding tensions with his former colleague Mr Altman, who posted on X: \"no thank you but we will buy twitter for $9.74 billion if you want.\" Read more from Sky News:Fears over Gaza truce as Hamas delays next hostage releaseUS president to impose steel tariffs Mr Musk bought Twitter, now called X, for $44bn (£38bn) in 2022.

Mr Musk and OpenAI lawyers faced off in a California federal court last week as a judge weighed up whether to back the X owner's request for a court order that would block the company from becoming a for-profit entity. US district judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers has not yet ruled on the request but said she would not stop the case from moving to a jury trial."

        "Content": "Scientists say they have spotted a rare circle of light in space, which comes from a far-away galaxy which has never been observed before. The Euclid space telescope captured images of the light, known as an Einstein ring, created by gravitational lensing around a different galaxy which is closer to Earth - 500 million light years away - which scientists say is a \"stone's throw away in cosmic terms\". That closer galaxy - the foreground galaxy - is called NGC 6505. But the ring of light around its centre has never been detected before. The ring is made up of light from a background galaxy 4.42 billion light-years away and what can be seen from Earth is distorted by gravity. The distant galaxy itself has not been observed before and has not yet been named. Such rings can help scientists test Albert Einstein's general theory of relativity, according to Professor Thomas Collett, from the University of Portsmouth's Institute of Cosmology and Gravitation. \"This lens is particularly special because it's in our cosmic backyard: a 'mere' 500 million light-years away,\" he said. \"In fact, it's so close that astronomers first observed the [NGC 6505] galaxy in the 1880s, but only with the resolving power of Euclid can we now reveal that it's a gravitational lens. \"Nearby lenses are exciting because they allow us to test the validity of general relativity on astronomical scales.\" What is Einstein's theory of general relativity? Einstein's theory of general relativity predicts light will bend around objects in space, so they focus the light like a giant lens - and the effect would be bigger for massive galaxies. It allows astronomers to see light from distant galaxies that would otherwise remain hidden.

It will help scientists unravel the cosmic history of the universe."

        "Content": "\n          News correspondent\n       More than 3,000 artists have called for Christie's to cancel its first-ever AI art auction, calling it \"mass theft\" of human artists' work. The petition urges the New York auction house to call off the event - where pieces range from $10,000 to $250,000 (£8,000 to £202,000) - citing \"serious concern\" over exploitation of artists. \"Many of the artworks you plan to auction were created using AI models that are known to be trained on copyrighted work without a licence,\" the petition says. \"These models, and the companies behind them, exploit human artists, using their work without permission or payment to build commercial AI products that compete with them.\" The petition, directed at Christie's, reads: \"Your support of these models, and the people who use them, rewards and further incentivises AI companies' mass theft of human artists' work. \"We ask that, if you have any respect for human artists, you cancel the auction.\" The battleground over training AI models has resulted in a number of lawsuits between companies and creatives alleging copyright was breached in the training process. Christie's said the works in the auction used AI to \"enhance\" the art. Concerns 'completely justified' One of the petition's leading signatories, British composer Ed Newton-Rex, told Sky News he thinks the letter is \"completely justified\". He said: \"It looks like around nine of the works in the auction were made using AI models that companies built using other artists' work without permission. \"I don't blame artists for using AI products that are available on the market, but I question why Christie's would implicitly condone these models by selling these works for tens or hundreds of thousands of dollars, when the exploitative technology behind them is impoverishing so many artists desperately trying to make a living.\" 'Bullying' artists The AI-dedicated event, running from 20 February to 5 March, includes work by Refik Anadol, Claire Silver, Sasha Stiles and others. Mat Dryhurst, a British artist whose work features in Christie's auction, told Sky News he did not agree with the artists speaking out against Christie's. He said he \"does not find attempts to bully artists in the least bit acceptable\".He added: \"It is not illegal to use any model to create artwork. \"I resent that an important debate that should be focused on companies and state policy is being focused on artists grappling with the technology of our time.\" Read more:AI summit: rift between regulation and innovation'Godfather' of AI warns arms race risks A spokesperson for Christie's told Sky News: \"The artists represented in this sale all have strong, existing multidisciplinary art practices, some recognised in leading museum collections. \"The works in this auction are using artificial intelligence to enhance their bodies of work.\""

        "Content": "\n          Science and Technology reporter\n       Heads of state and tech bosses are gathering, with some trying to break US and Chinese dominance in artificial intelligence. Top government officials and scientists from around 100 countries are gathering in Paris for the AI Action Summit, which will discuss the future of artificial intelligence. Co-hosted by India's Narendra Modi, the summit's guests also include US vice president JD Vance, Canada's Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and China's deputy leader Zhang Guoqing. It's Mr Vance's first overseas trip in his new position, but many of the summit's attendees, including Mr Modi, are hoping to break his country's dominance in artificial intelligence. The ten biggest AI companies in the world are based in the US including Apple, Nvidia, Microsoft, Oracle, Meta and Alphabet. A fortnight ago, Chinese company DeepSeek also threw the industry into chaos when it revealed an AI model more powerful than ChatGPT and made for a fraction of the cost, showing just how powerful China could be in the industry. Mr Modi has said he intends to bring a wider range of people into AI development and prevent the sector from becoming a US-China battle. His foreign secretary Vikram Misri also stressed the need for equitable access to AI to avoid \"perpetuating a digital divide that is already existing across the world\". Analysis:Paris summit shows dangers of AI race Innovation, regulation and the challenges of embracing AI However, breaking US dominance may be easier said than done, especially for countries with stricter AI regulation. President Trump has already torn up rules imposed by Joe Biden, saying they \"hinder[ed] AI innovation and impose[d] onerous and unnecessary government control over the development of AI\". That's a sentiment echoed by big tech bosses. \"If we want growth, jobs and progress, we must allow innovators to innovate, builders to build and developers to develop,\" Sam Altman, chief executive of OpenAI, wrote in Le Monde ahead of the summit. \"There's a lot of complicated questions to resolve\" around issues like the ability to control AI systems, said Sir Demis Hassabis, founder of Google DeepMind, at the summit. \"But also I think even more complicated are maybe the geopolitical questions about things like regulation.\" Companies in EU countries, for example, may find it harder to innovate than those in the US or China after the EU introduced the AI Safety Bill last year, which imposes strict restrictions on how AI can be used in the region. The UK also has guidelines around how AI can be used, but in January, Sir Keir Starmer promised to \"mainline AI into the veins\" of the country, saying AI could bring £47bn to the economy every year. As well as politicians, the tech world's elite are in the French capital, with Mr Altman, Microsoft president Brad Smith and Google chief executive Sundar Pichai among the big names attending. What keeps AI experts awake at night Yoshua Bengio, known as one of the \"godfathers of AI\", will also speak at the event. The scientist recently said he is \"kept awake at night\" by the fear that humans may build systems \"smarter than us that we don't know how to control\". Protecting people from unregulated AI is one of the topics up for discussion at the conference but a leaked draft of the document that will be signed by attending countries tomorrow doesn't appear to mention mitigating AI's risks. Read more:UK to 'lose AI leadership' without data strategyHow to protect your privacy from AI  One attendee, MIT professor Max Tegmark who is the president of the Future of Life Institute, urged countries not to sign the document. \"To reap unimaginable benefits without endangering millions of livelihoods and lives, AI needs binding safety standards - like we have for every other industry,\" he said in a statement to Sky News. \"This is supported by history, science, public opinion and common-sense. This critical moment calls for courageous leaders who take action - not ones who bury their heads in the sand to appease Big Tech. \"Countries should not sign it.\""

        "Content": "\n          Science and technology editor\n              @t0mclark3\n The AI Action Summit is arguably a coming together of the most powerful people in the world. Sure, political representatives from all our major economies are convening here in Paris. But in the age of artificial intelligence, it's the big tech companies who own the powerful AI models, as well as the hardware and expertise to design and build them, that also wield true power. In late 2023, the UK government convened the first international AI summit at Bletchley Park near London. Its focus was supposedly on AI safety and how governments could ensure their citizens' jobs, or even lives, weren't threatened by the rapid rise of superintelligent AI that tech bosses assured them was just around the corner. But the undercurrent was very much political leaders trying to figure out how to capitalise on the advantages AI will undoubtedly bring. Things are different now. Donald Trump has vowed to make the US the world's AI superpower. Almost as soon as the words left his mouth, however, a Chinese company, DeepSeek, proved that it could rival American \"big tech\" despite strict controls on leading AI hardware. It's no accident that China, which remained on the sidelines of previous summits, has sent vice premier Zhang Guoqing - seen as President Xi Jinping's right-hand man. JD Vance is also making his first overseas trip as US vice president in order to attend the summit. French President Emmanuel Macron is keen to steer the conversation away from the risks of a race towards computer superintelligence and towards how AI tools can be used for things societies need, such as curing disease and improving public services. Read more from Sky News:Trump to impose tariffs on all steel and aluminium importsLabour MP 'deeply regrets' WhatsApp commentsMore than 600 immigration arrests in January The big tech firms want to talk about that too, and how Mr Trump's plans for the lightest-touch regulation are the only way to ensure the AI innovation that governments want. Mr Macron wants leaders to commit to a political declaration around ethical, democratic and environmental principles when it comes to AI. But a leaked draft of the text makes little mention of safety. That is at odds with the EU's tougher regulatory stance on AI - and the views of many AI experts on the sidelines of this summit. They continue to warn of the dangers of a big tech oligopoly on AI. They also warn of the risks of their role, deliberate or not, in a geopolitical race for AI supremacy that leaders like Donald Trump and Xi Jinping are likely to pursue."

        "Content": "Kanye West has been criticised over a TV advert directing people to a website selling a swastika T-shirt during the Super Bowl. It shows him lying down, telling viewers: \"I spent all the money for the commercial on these new teeth, so once again I had to shoot it on the iPhone... go to Yeezy.com.\" The site now features nothing but a single T-shirt with a swastika on the front - alongside the code \"HH-01\" - believed to be a reference to \"Heil Hitler\". The advert was shown in the Los Angeles area during the big game, but not nationwide. It comes after West deactivated his X account after more antisemitic posts last week. The rapper's final entry stated: \"I'm logging out of Twitter. I appreciate [X owner] Elon [Musk] for allowing me to vent. \"It has been very cathartic to use the world as a sounding board. It was like an Ayahuasca trip.\" \"Love all of you who gave me your energy and attention. To we connect again [sic]. Good afternoon and goodnight.\"  West made multiple posts on Friday, including statements such as \"I love Hitler\" and \"I'm a Nazi\" - with the Campaign Against Antisemitism calling on Mr Musk to ban him. The group said the T-shirt listing was another damning example of West's dangerous prejudice. \"The swastika is the symbol adopted by Hitler as the primary emblem of the Nazis,\" it posted. \"It galvanized his followers in the 20th century and continues to threaten and instil fear in those targeted by antisemitism and white supremacy.\" West - also known as Ye - has been suspended from Twitter at least twice before. In October 2022, his account was restricted over antisemitic comments but he returned the following month. The outcry prompted Adidas to end their lucrative trainer deal. Two months later, he was locked out again after posts including one appearing to show a swastika inside a Star of David. Elon Musk, who rebranded Twitter as X in 2023, said at the time the suspension was \"for incitement to violence\" but the account was back up and running the following summer.

        "Content": "\n          Arts and entertainment reporter\n              @BethanyMinelle\n The creator of TV crime dramas Silent Witness and New Tricks, Nigel McCrery, has died aged 71. He had been diagnosed with a terminal illness in October 2024. The screenwriter's agent posted a photo on social media on Monday, paying tribute and confirming his death. United Agents wrote: \"It's with a heavy heart that we share the news of screenwriter, author and producer Nigel McCrery's passing. \"As the creative mind behind such hits as the much-loved, long-running BBC drama series Silent Witness and New Tricks, Nigel captivated and inspired audiences for years with his work. \"His numerous contributions to the arts will always be remembered. Nigel had an incredible career and will be greatly missed. Our thoughts are with his family at this time.\" Reacting to his death, actress Emilia Fox said that Silent Witness's \"success and longevity\" was \"testament\" to its creator, who she described as \"kind and warm\".Fox, who plays forensic pathologist Dr Nikki Alexander in the BBC TV series, wrote on Instagram: \"I am so sorry to hear the terribly sad news about the passing of Nigel McCrery.\"In creating Silent Witness he brought something special to so many audiences around the world, and to those of us lucky enough to work on the show. Its success and longevity are testament to Nigel and his brilliant idea in the first place - and of course many other shows too.\"I was hugely fond of him personally. He was always kind and warm and spoke devotedly of his own family as an extremely proud parent and grandparent.\" She went on: \"I am grateful that he remained connected to the show ongoingly and always wanted to know what plans there were for it.\" Fox said forensic pathologist Helen Whitwell, who was the woman who had inspired the Sam Ryan character played by Amanda Burton in the TV series, had also passed away recently, adding, \"we will do our best to make them proud\". McCrery's daughter, Rebecca commented on Fox's tribute, writing: \"Thank you for your kind words Emilia. My Dad always spoke fondly of you.\" Running for 28 series and still ongoing, Silent Witness follows a team of forensic pathologists investigating crimes. It is one of the BBC's longest-running dramas. New Tricks, about a group of retired detectives helping police solve cold cases, aired for over a decade, across 12 series. McCrery began his career working as a police officer with the Nottinghamshire Constabulary murder squad, where he developed an interest in forensic science. He left the force after a decade to study at Cambridge University, after which he began working for the BBC, eventually ending up in the drama department. It was there he wrote his first TV series, police procedural Backup, in 1995, which ran for two years. Silent Witness followed, airing in 1996, initially starring Amanda Burton as the lead detective, before Emilia Fox's character took the reins in the eighth series. A 29th series is expected to follow the one which aired at the start of this year. The drama is also broadcast around the world. New Tricks, which starred Dennis Waterman across all 12 series, premiered in 2003, with its final episode showing in 2015. McCrery also penned All The King's Men - a First World War drama starring Sir David Jason, medical drama Born And Bred, and Impact, about a group of air accident investigators, all of which aired on the BBC. He also wrote several novels, a play and numerous military history books."

        "Content": " Celebrities including Taylor Swift, Jay-Z, Sir Paul McCartney and Bradley Cooper were out in force for arguably America's biggest sporting event of the year - the Super Bowl - as the Philadelphia Eagles beat the Kansas City Chiefs 40-22. But it wasn't just the stars of music and acting who were among the crowds to watch the American football spectacle at the Caesars Superdome in New Orleans, Louisiana. Donald Trump made history by becoming the first sitting US president to attend a Super Bowl. Pop superstar Swift was there to cheer on her boyfriend Travis Kelce, who plays for the Kansas City Chiefs. The team were trying to win their third Super Bowl title in a row. When the singer appeared on the Jumbotron video wall, some Eagles fans started booing her. Later, Mr Trump trolled her, writing on his Truth Social platform: \"The only one that had a tougher night than the Kansas City Chiefs was Taylor Swift. She got BOOED out of the Stadium. MAGA is very unforgiving!\" Swift had endorsed Mr Trump's rival Kamala Harris in the 2024 presidential election. \n                  Trump says Palestinians couldn't return to Gaza under his redevelopment plan\n                 \n                  Trump's steel and aluminium tariffs target a deeper issue - but risk job losses and higher prices\n                 \n                  'People will die': Chaos and mounting fear in Uganda as USAID cuts lead to 'total panic' and HIV clinic closures\n                 Analysis: World can't get through a day without noticing Trump Before Sunday's game, Mr Trump walked on to the field to meet families of the victims of the New Year's Day terror attack in the city, as well as police and other emergency personnel. Fourteen people were killed and dozens of others injured when US Army veteran Shamsud-Din Jabbar drove a pick-up truck into crowds on Bourbon Street early on 1 January this year. He was then shot dead by police.  When Mr Trump entered the stadium, he was greeted with a mix of cheers and boos from the crowd. He watched Super Bowl 59 from a box, along with his daughter Ivanka and son Eric, as well as several politicians who accompanied him on Air Force One to New Orleans. First Lady Melania Trump did not attend. During his first term in office, Mr Trump criticised the National Football League (NFL) and its members after black players kneeled during the US national anthem to bring attention to racial injustice. For Sunday's game, the league put the phrase \"Choose Love\" behind one of the end zones. It replaced the previous phrase \"End Racism\", which has been used since 2021. Stars in the stands included Taylor Swift, Jay-Z and former Beatle Sir Paul McCartney, as well as Hollywood stars Adam Sandler, Paul Rudd and Kevin Costner. One of the most famous parts of the Super Bowl is the half-time show, which this year was headlined by rapper Kendrick Lamar. Hollywood actor Samuel L Jackson, dressed as Uncle Sam, introduced the musician. Lamar performed a string of hits including Humble, which featured a group of dancers in red, white and blue, forming an American flag before moving on to Toxic Love with SZA.

Lamar went on to perform the track which was named song and record of the year at the Grammys last weekend. Tennis star Serena Williams, who is referenced on the track, appeared briefly as a dancer during the performance. Drake is suing Universal Music Group for defamation and harassment, over its release of Not Like Us last year. He has claimed the track contained defamatory content accusing him of serious misconduct. 👉 Follow Trump 100 on your podcast app 👈 There were around 80 Super Bowl advertising slots and some cost a record $8m for 30 seconds this year. Among the adverts, football star David Beckham and actor Matt Damon were long-lost twins who bonded over a beer, while Meg Ryan and Billy Crystal re-enacted their famous deli scene from 1989's When Harry Met Sally, except this time Sally was expressing her enthusiasm for mayonnaise. Also, British singer Seal became an actual seal that was sad he could not hold a drink with his flippers, celebrity chef Gordon Ramsay and comedian Pete Davidson teamed up for a cookware commercial, and The Muppets searched for accommodations with a booking site."

        "Content": "A man who believes he accidentally lost a Bitcoin fortune in a council rubbish tip is exploring the possibility of buying the landfill site before it is shut. James Howells, from Newport in South Wales, claimed his ex-girlfriend mistakenly threw out a hard drive containing thousands of Bitcoins in 2013. According to the 39-year-old IT worker, they are worth more than £600m and he has been trying to recover them ever since. Now he is considering buying the site so he can hunt for the missing fortune himself, multiple outlets reported on Monday. Newport City Council is planning to close and cap the site in the 2025-26 financial year, which would almost certainly spell the end of any lingering hopes of recovering them. Mr Howells said in widely reported comments on Monday it had been \"quite a surprise\" to hear of the council's closure plan. Last month a judge dismissed a legal case he brought to force the council to allow him to search the landfill site, or award him £495m in compensation. He said the council had claimed in court that closing the landfill to allow him to search \"would have a huge detrimental impact on the people of Newport, whilst at the same time they were planning to close the landfill anyway. \"I expected it would be closed in the coming years because it's 80-90% full - but didn't expect its closure so soon. \"If Newport City Council would be willing, I would potentially be interested in purchasing the landfill site 'as is' and have discussed this option with investment partners and it is something that is very much on the table.\" Read more on Sky News:Who benefits from Trump's latest tariffs?Police stop Ed Sheeran buskingMonkey 'caused nationwide power outage' Judge Keyser KC said Mr Howells' claim had \"no realistic prospect of succeeding\" if he allowed it to go to trial, The Guardian reported Newport City Council has been contacted for comment."

The island nation's 22 million residents were mostly left without power during the outage, which began around 11am local time (5.30am GMT) on Sunday. The country's energy minister, Kumara Jayakody, told reporters that the blackout was caused when a monkey came into contact with a grid transformer near the island's executive and judicial capital, Colombo. \"A monkey has come in contact with our grid transformer, causing an imbalance in the system,\" Mr Jayakody said following the blackout. \"Engineers are attending to it to try and restore the service as soon as possible,\" he added. Power was returned to some areas within hours, but many households were without electricity until late on Sunday. Sri Lanka has suffered issues with its electrical system before. In 2022 it experienced widespread blackouts and electricity rationing during an economic crisis.

The paper said engineers had been warning consecutive governments to upgrade the system or face frequent blackouts \"for years\". \"The national power grid is in such a weakened state that frequent islandwide power outages may be expected if there is a disturbance even in one of our lines,\" a source told the outlet."

        "Content": "A rare flower with a pungent odour that has been likened to decaying flesh, rotten eggs and sewage has bloomed in Australia - the third such flowering in recent months. The corpse flower, also known by its scientific name amorphophallus titanum or titan arum, bloomed for the first time in its 15 years at Canberra's Australian National Botanic Gardens on Saturday and was due to close on Monday, staff said. The flower is called bunga bangkai in its native Indonesia, and is endemic to the rainforests of western Sumatra. Its pungent scent attracts pollinators such as flies. There are thought to be only 300 of the plants in the wild and fewer than 1,000 in total. It only blooms for a few days every seven to 10 years in its natural habitat - but another flowered briefly in Sydney at the Royal Botanic Gardens in late January, attracting 20,000 admirers. Similar numbers turned out to experience another rancid bloom at the Geelong Botanic Gardens, southwest of Melbourne, in November. Canberra's acting nursery manager Carol Dale said there was no clear explanation for Australia's spate of putrid blooms. A flower is produced when the titan arum has stored enough energy in its underground tuber, known as a corm. Ms Dale said: \"One of the theories is that a lot of these plants are of a similar age, so they have just stored up enough carbohydrates in the corm to finally produce a flower. \"All of the plants around Australia are held in different conditions, so it's unusual that they're all flowering at the same time.\" She said Canberra, Sydney and Geelong each had different climates, and gardeners used different fertilising regimes on each plant, as well as different management plans. Ms Dale said that after 15 years without a bloom, she had decided that Canberra, which occasionally receives snowfall, was not the place for a corpse plant to thrive. \"It's been in our collection for slightly longer than these plants would normally take to flower for the first time, so we just didn't think we had the right conditions here in Canberra,\" she said. \"So yes, it did catch us by surprise; a very pleasant one,\" she added.

We could smell it from across the road. It was definitely gag-worthy,\" Ms Dale said. The crowds attracted to the 135cm (53in) tall flower were limited to hundreds by a ticketing system because of space constraints within the greenhouse.  Admirers said the stench was similar to dead animals, rotten eggs, sweaty socks, sewage and rubbish. But Ms Dale said the worst of the smell had passed by Monday. \"We collected pollen about an hour ago and when you're right up close to the plant, it's still got that rotting flesh smell,\" she said."
