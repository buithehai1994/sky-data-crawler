        "Content": "Over a million more documents potentially related to the Jeffrey Epstein case have been uncovered, the US Department of Justice has said.  Warning: This article contains references to sexual assault In a post on X, it said it had received the documents from the US attorney for the Southern District of New York and the FBI, to review them for release. The full release of the files could take a \"few more weeks\", the justice department said, further delaying compliance with a 19 December deadline set by Congress.  Just hours before the announcement, a dozen US senators called on the justice department's watchdog to examine its failure to meet Friday's deadline. The update came one day after the largest tranche of files relating to Jeffrey Epstein was released. Inclusion in the files does not suggest any wrongdoing and have been released with little or no context. Live updates: Epstein files latest However, inside those 11,000 files were the testimonies of numerous alleged victims of Epstein - a convicted child sex offender. Sky News has collated some of the excerpts from those harrowing testimonies. Accuser says parents sold her for sex Two of the documents appear to be taken from an email sent by an alleged victim to Hope for Justice, a charity that aims to end human trafficking. The woman, whose identity has been redacted, has written up answers to \"preliminary questions\" the organisation says it needs to \"evaluate human trafficking situations for potential rescue\". The subject line of the email, which was sent in 2019, reads: \"I'm sorry this took so long, please let me know if you need anything else.\" We do not know any more context about what the witness recounts. She begins by saying she was \"born into sex trafficking\". \"I do not remember a time that I was not trafficked for sex. According to birth certificate from [REDACTED] my biological parents (I do not recognize them as parents) [REDACTED] began to sell me for sex in the town of [REDACTED],\" she writes. \"There were many men that were brought to their home to have sex with me. I was taken to many states in the US to sell me. I was forced by threat by [REDACTED], and Jeffery Epstein of being killed, bodily harm, and threats of harming other children if I did not have sex with them and any other people that they sold me to.\" The woman then recounts being \"taken to an underground location\", where Jeffrey Epstein raped her. There is no indication of when the events took place. Her written statement reads: \"In Virgin Islands, I was [REDACTED] they stopped there. I was 17 years old, [REDACTED] was blindfolded and taken to an underground location. It had steps that went down. \"I was raped by Jeffery [sic] Epstein, there were other men that raped me. I was kept in a stall so that men could look at me. \"He said I was an animal and that he was perfect, if I had sex with him that I wouldn't be such an animal. [REDACTED]. He said I wanted to be raped because I wanted to be more like him.\" Woman told FBI she was taken to Epstein's island at 13 In an email sent in October 2024, a threat intake examiner at the FBI National Threat Operations Center summarises an account given by a woman, who said she had been trafficked for sex and brought to Jeffrey Epstein's island when she was 13. The unnamed officer says the victim reported being trafficked from the age of five, after being taken from an apartment and \"cut in the throat\". They recount the woman said she was taken again at the age of 12 or 13 to Paris, where she was raped by three men. \"The men were a part of an organisation that would take naked photos of young girls and used [REDACTED] photo where she flew to Ireland for politicians and notable men,\" the email continues. \"They would have sex with the young women and she was taken from Ireland and brought to Jeffery [sic] Epstein Island when she was 13 years old. \"[REDACTED] said the only way to get off the island was to take naked photos or pose that is why there are so many photos laying around the house.\" Read more about the Epstein files:Files appear to show Andrew asking Ghislaine Maxwell for 'inappropriate friends'Epstein survivor on moment she met Andrew on private islandEpstein files don't join the dots to broader conspiracy - but his survivors could Witness, 14, was instructed to tell Epstein she was 17 Among the documents is a summary written in 2007 of an FBI interview with a witness who says she met Epstein at the age of 14. The woman, whose name has been redacted, told the FBI she was introduced to the paedophile by a 17-year-old girl, who asked her if she would like to make £300 by \"providing a man in Palm Beach with a massage\". \"She needed to dress sexy and provide a massage for an hour and she would make $300. [REDACTED] told [REDACTED] that Epstein might ask her to remove her shirt, but she could keep her bra on,\" the summary says. It continues: \"Epstein told [REDACTED] she was pretty. Epstein asked her age. [REDACTED] uttered \"four\" and then said 17. \"Epstein responded by saying, 'so you are fourteen'. \"[REDACTED] was previously instructed by [REDACTED] to tell Epstein she was 17. He told [REDACTED] that they would not tell anyone.\" The witness also told investigators: \"According to [REDACTED] if a girl felt uncomfortable and did not want to comply with Epstein's requests, he would ask them to bring other girls.\" 17-year-old approached in New York park Another document tells of a 17-year-old girl who says she was approached by a stranger in a New York park about a dog-walking job, and later sexually abused. The incident was reported in 2020 via a rape hotline run by the City of New York police department. The log entry reads: \"In 1992, C/V states when she was 17 y/o she met an unknown female in Central Park who offered her a dog walking position.\" \"C/V\" is thought to be an abbreviation of \"complainant/victim\". The entry continues: \"C/v states the female brought her back to a residence at Central Park West to meet her boss (Jeffrey Epstein) to be interviewed.\" It adds: \"C/v states while there she was offered something to drink. Afterwards, c/v states she felt dizzy and shaky. CN states she remembers feeling tired and leaning back. \"C/V states she remembers waking up in a room with someone heavy on her chest. C/v states she fell asleep again and remembers being brought to the bathroom to wash up. \"C/v states there was bleeding in her vaginal area. C/v states 2 women helped her get dressed and being sent away in a cab.\""

        "Content": "The latest US-Ukraine peace plan suggests eastern areas seized by Russia could become free economic zones. President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said a \"demilitarised zone or a free economic zone\" could potentially resolve a stalemate over the future of the Donbas. Russia wants the whole region, even areas it has not captured, but Ukraine has said it is unacceptable. Details of the plan came as two police officers were killed in a bombing in Moscow on Wednesday, the second in three days after the killing of a general on Monday.  Ukraine has not confirmed it was behind the incidents, but has claimed responsibility for similar assassinations in the past. The bombings could be Kyiv's way of trying to shift the narrative in peace talks and showing it is still on the offensive and able to hit Russia at home, says Sky's Moscow correspondent Ivor Bennett. The revised 20-point plan was made public on Wednesday and follows recent US-Ukraine talks in Miami. President Zelenskyy said a US proposal for a free economic zone was a \"potential option\" for a sovereign Ukrainian state but it would have to be agreed via a referendum. Such zones typically have laws different to those in the rest of a country, such as less tax and relaxed customs and regulations. Mr Zelenskyy said the US and Ukraine had \"significantly brought most of the positions closer together\" but that negotiators still could not reach a consensus on territorial sticking points. He said he now wanted a meeting with Donald Trump as \"sensitive issues\" needed to be \"discussed at leaders' level\". The future of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, Europe's biggest, is another issue the US and Ukraine have not yet agreed on. America has suggested it should be a partner and chief manager in a consortium including Ukraine and Russia. The updated peace plan also includes robust security guarantees and Article 5-like protections to protect Ukraine from future aggression, as well as EU membership and keeping its army at 800,000 personnel. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said Moscow would set out its position based on information received by envoy Kirill Dmitriev, who met US officials in Florida over the weekend. US special envoy Steve Witkoff was part of a delegation that held talks with President Vladimir Putin at the start of December but there was no breakthrough and the Ukrainian people have continued to suffer. It was hit by one of the biggest aerial bombardments of the near four-year war this week, with more than 600 drones and several dozen missiles launched. Most were intercepted but at least three people, including a young child were killed, and there were widespread power cuts after hits on the electricity network. Read more from Sky News:British boy stabbed to death in Portugal namedFourth Palestine Action detainee pauses hunger strike President Zelenskyy also released a Christmas message of unity on Wednesday. \"Despite all the suffering that Russia has brought, it is not capable of occupying or bombing what matters most. That is our Ukrainian heart, our faith in one another, and our unity,\" he said in a video on Telegram. He added: \"In the skies over Kyiv and Zakarpattia, Odesa or Kupyansk - wherever we may be - Ukrainians are together tonight - marking Christmas on the same date, as one big family.\""

        "Content": "\n          Moscow correspondent\n              @IvorBennett\n A second fatal bombing on the streets of Moscow in the space of three days. We do not know the full details of this latest explosion but the fact these incidents keep happening will be highly embarrassing for the Kremlin. Monday's car bomb that killed Lieutenant General Fanil Sarvarov was the latest in a long line of high-profile hits on Russian soil since the Kremlin's invasion of Ukraine. Live updates: Ukraine war latest When a top military official was killed in similar circumstances this time last year, by a bomb hidden in a scooter, Vladimir Putin criticised Russia's security services and told them they should learn from their mistakes. It does not look like they have. Since then, there have been many more assassinations of senior officials - both in Moscow and further afield. This latest killing of two police officers in the same area as Monday's attack only makes things worse. \n                  Ksenia Karelina: Ballerina arrives home in US after 'nightmare' of Russian penal colony\n                 \n                  Do Russians believe Donald Trump can stop the war in Ukraine?\n                 \n                  Killing of Russian general Igor Kirillov will ring alarm bells inside embarrassed Kremlin\n                 It doesn't just look complacent. It's starting to appear incompetent. Although Ukraine has been behind some of the attacks, in this case, it has not commented. But could this have been Kyiv's way of trying to change the narrative in the peace talks? To show Donald Trump that Russia doesn't 'hold all the cards'? The timing has certainly been helpful for Ukraine, coinciding with the latest negotiations. So perhaps it's no coincidence that Kyiv has seemingly made progress in convincing Washington to agree to a less punishing peace proposal. Article 5-style security guarantees are a big win for Ukraine, as is an allowance to retain the strength of its armed forces. They are yet to convince the US on territory, but it's still progress nonetheless. Will Moscow agree to the other points? Don't hold your breath. Russia's position \"is well known\", the Kremlin said, when asked for its reaction to the latest proposals, suggesting it remains unmoved in its opposition to a security guarantee involving foreign troops. But even so, it seems the spotlight is back on Moscow."

Showing off their musical skills, mother and daughter featured at the beginning of Kate's annual carol service, broadcast on Wednesday evening, performing a surprise duet. They recorded the special moment in the Inner Hall at Windsor Castle last week, playing Holm Sound by Erland Cooper, which is apparently a piece they enjoy practising at home together.   Cooper, a Scottish composer, was invited to Windsor to watch the filming. A spokesperson said \"their Royal Highnesses were delighted to be joined on the day by Erland who was able to give them some guidance between takes\". Originally from Orkney, Erland's work is inspired by nature and connection, themes which are also integral to Kate's work. He wrote the composition for his mother, also called Charlotte. The carol service was held on 5 December at Westminster Abbey, with William and Kate joined by Prince George, Princess Charlotte and Prince Louis. The event, with 1,600 people in the congregation, has become a festive tradition for the Princess of Wales, and an opportunity to bring together representatives from the different strands of her and Prince William's charitable work. For what was the fifth Together at Christmas carol service, the overriding theme was the importance of love.

Eight remand prisoners had stopped eating, demanding the UK stops hosting weapons factories that supply arms to Israel, removes the proscription of Palestine Action as a terrorist group, and gives those on remand immediate bail. Kamran Ahmad, 29, who has been on remand at HMP Peterborough for 13 months has been hospitalised three times during his hunger strike, which on Wednesday reached 45 days.   \"His spirit is strong,\" his sister Shahmina Alam told Sky News, adding that Ahmad had started developing twitches. \"The prison has moved him to cells closer to the nurse's station to ensure he's able to have his vitals managed and respond to any emergency situations.\" \"Kamran is still determined,\" she said of his resolve. \"He feels this is the only way to exercise his demands.\" HMP Peterborough has said in a statement: \"We cannot provide information about specific individuals however we can confirm that all prisoners are managed in line with the policies and procedures governing the entire HMPPS managed prison estate.\" All eight hunger strikers were detained in prison on remand while they await trial for alleged break-ins or criminal damage carried out in the name of Palestine Action before the group was banned under terrorism legislation. By the time they are tried, all will have spent more than a year in custody. Three others who remain on hunger strike are Heba Muraisi, Lewie Chiaramello, who is type 1 diabetic and has been fasting every other day for 31 days and Teuta Hoxha, who has been on remand for 13 months. Hoxha is on day 46 of her hunger strike. After a prison visit on Wednesday, her sister Rahma, 17, told Sky News: \"She's losing an enormous amount of weight. She showed me her arms and I can see her bones sticking out. \"My sister is struggling to talk, has a constant headache and she's been having heart palpitations.\" Rahma added: \"She's very firm on her demands.\" Amy Gardiner-Gibson, who also goes by the name Amu Gib, began eating again on Wednesday after 49 days of going without food, according to the campaign group Prisoners for Palestine. In the past week, Qesser Zuhrah also paused her hunger strike after 48 days, hinting she might resume it in the new year. Umer Khalid and Jon Cink ended their strikes after 13 and 41 days, respectively. Palestine Action told Sky News that all pauses were carried out in hospital under medical supervision to prevent refeeding syndrome, a life-threatening shift of fluids and body salts (electrolytes) that can occur when malnourished patients receive treatment with refeeding. Over the course of the strike, seven members of the group have been taken to hospital and doctors have raised concerns about the long-term impact on their health.

We are proud of it. We will protect it,\" she said in a post on social media. French President Emmanuel Macron said that the visa restrictions \"amount to intimidation and coercion aimed at undermining European digital sovereignty\". The EU's digital rules were adopted by \"a democratic and sovereign process\" involving all member countries and the European Parliament, he said in a post on X. Mr Macron said the rules \"ensure fair competition among platforms, without targeting any third country\" and that \"the rules governing the European Union's digital space are not meant to be determined outside Europe\". 'Rules not decided in Washington' Mr Breton and the other Europeans were affected by a new visa policy announced in May that bars entry to foreigners accused of censoring protected speech in the United States. Germany's justice ministry said the two German activists had the government's \"support and solidarity\" and that the visa bans on them were unacceptable. \"Anyone who describes this as censorship is misrepresenting our constitutional system,\" it said in a statement. \"The rules by which we want to live in the digital space in Germany and in Europe are not decided in Washington.\" A Global Disinformation Index spokesperson called the visa bans \"an authoritarian attack on free speech and an egregious act of government censorship\". \"The Trump administration is, once again, using the full weight of the federal government to intimidate, censor, and silence voices they disagree with,\" they said. \"Their actions today are immoral, unlawful, and un-American.\" Read more from Sky News:Epstein survivor speaks of moment she met AndrewBritish man faces deportation over alleged Nazi symbols Breton is not the first French national to face sanctions from the Trump administration.

The Latin Patriarch of Jerusalem, Cardinal Pierbattista Pizzaballa, was flanked by adoring crowds as he marched down the ancient, narrow cobblestoned roads to Manger Square in front of the Church of the Nativity and blessed the babies of Bethlehem along the way. After arriving, the cardinal stepped up on stage and told the full square of tourists and Palestinians from across the occupied West Bank: \"You are the light, we are the light. The light of Bethlehem is the light of the world.\" At the base of the Christmas tree towering over Manger Square for the first time since 2022, a nativity display with baby Jesus sitting above a decorated billboard emblazoned with the text: \"From here, the light of peace began.\"  Before the procession set off for Bethlehem, at the Mar Elias Monastery in East Jerusalem, the cardinal told me: \"This is a sign that we want to turn the page to look forward. \"The problems on the ground remain there but we need to react and respond to this situation and to look forward in order to find perspective and solutions for the terrible situation there.\" He has just returned from celebrating Christmas in the Holy Family Parish in Gaza, where 400 people are still being sheltered. The Gaza Health Ministry reports that at least 400 people have been killed and over 1,000 injured since the start of the ceasefire on 10 October. \"It was sad to see the disaster in which the population are living in,\" said the cardinal. \"I was very struck by the resilience and their desire of life. They are very strong and determined to rebuild everything.\" Here in the West Bank, violence is increasing as illegal Israeli settlements expand. On Sunday, Israel's far-right finance minister Bezalel Smotrich announced the approval of 19 more settlements - a move condemned by a group of 12 countries including Britain, Canada and Germany on Wednesday. As we drive, we see Israeli flags mark a new settlement on the hilltop shepherd fields of Bethlehem's Ush al Ghrab, where Jesus's birth was announced in the Bible. According to the United Nations Office for Co-ordination in Humanitarian Affairs (UNOCHA), 238 Palestinians, including 56 children were killed by Israeli forces or settlers in the West Bank in 2025. In Bethlehem's Tuqu' village, a mother grieves her 16-year-old son Ammar as Christmas is celebrated in the heart of the governate. He was shot by the IDF in a raid on 15 December. At his funeral, 24 hours later, his friend Muheeb Ahmed was reportedly shot and killed by a settler. The IDF told Sky News: \"During IDF activity in the area of Tekoa, a confrontation occurred in which rocks were hurled toward the soldiers. The soldiers used riot dispersal means and later on fired toward a main inciter, and a hit was identified. \"The incident is under review.\" Read more from Sky News:Canal boat falls into huge holeBritish 13-year-old boy stabbed to death in Portugal namedTeenagers killed in Tesla taxi crash in Surrey are named Ammar's mother tells us while cradling his photo: \"Why would you kill a child? \"He hasn't harmed you or is armed. What is a rock compared to gunpowder? It is nothing but they are cowards.\" \"When I see the [Christmas] celebrations, I get upset and cry. \"I have to be honest, it hurts to see people celebrating because Palestine is still bleeding and people are dying from the rain and hunger. We are one nation. Why would they put up the tree? Why would they celebrate?\" For Palestinian Christians gathering to celebrate, festivities still feel sombre but an opportunity to revive hope. \"It is a moment to pray and pray for peace, solidarity and hope,\" Monica Awad tells us in Manger Square as Christmas approaches. \"It hurts us so much to see our friends, family are still suffering in Gaza, even at this moment. But there is always hope. We believe in hope for a better future.\" The war in Gaza started following the 7 October attack in 2023, when more than 1,200 people, mostly civilians, were killed by Hamas militants and more than 250 were taken hostage. Health officials in Gaza say nearly 71,000 Palestinians have been killed since - a figure that does not differentiate between civilians and Hamas militants."

Showing off their musical skills, mother and daughter featured at the beginning of Kate's annual carol service, broadcast on Wednesday evening, performing a surprise duet. They recorded the special moment in the Inner Hall at Windsor Castle last week, playing Holm Sound by Erland Cooper, which is apparently a piece they enjoy practising at home together.   Cooper, a Scottish composer, was invited to Windsor to watch the filming. A spokesperson said \"their Royal Highnesses were delighted to be joined on the day by Erland who was able to give them some guidance between takes\". Originally from Orkney, Erland's work is inspired by nature and connection, themes which are also integral to Kate's work. He wrote the composition for his mother, also called Charlotte. The carol service was held on 5 December at Westminster Abbey, with William and Kate joined by Prince George, Princess Charlotte and Prince Louis. The event, with 1,600 people in the congregation, has become a festive tradition for the Princess of Wales, and an opportunity to bring together representatives from the different strands of her and Prince William's charitable work. For what was the fifth Together at Christmas carol service, the overriding theme was the importance of love.

The country's criminal police (Judicial Police) said it is investigating the death by stabbing of 13-year-old Alfie Hallett and the alleged attacker. Local media say Portuguese police believe the perpetrator, who has also died, was the former partner of the boy's mother. The mother was found \"showing signs of having been restrained and assaulted, and was subsequently taken to the nearest hospital\", police said in a statement. \"Both the alleged assailant and the minor presented several injuries caused by a bladed weapon but, despite vital signs still being detectable, death was declared at the scene moments later.\" Police said the GNR (National Republican Guard) were called out after the alarm had been raised about what was feared to be a domestic violence situation, in the city of Tomar in central Portugal. \"Inside the house, there was a strong smell of gas which, moments later, resulted in an explosion that injured one of the GNR officers,\" the police statement added. \"The alleged perpetrator had already served a prison sentence for aggravated homicide, and the family had been flagged following domestic violence cases registered in 2022 and 2023.\" Sport Club Operario de Cem Soldos's basketball team in Tomar paid tribute to Alfie, saying he will \"always be in our hearts\". In a Facebook post, the club said: \"(Alfie) played his last game on Saturday, played so well seemed like he knew it was his last game. \"We want to tell you how much we love you and that you will always be in our hearts.\" Chamusca Basket Clube, the club Alfie had played against in Saturday's match, also posted a tribute on Facebook.

Eight remand prisoners had stopped eating, demanding the UK stops hosting weapons factories that supply arms to Israel, removes the proscription of Palestine Action as a terrorist group, and gives those on remand immediate bail. Kamran Ahmad, 29, who has been on remand at HMP Peterborough for 13 months has been hospitalised three times during his hunger strike, which on Wednesday reached 45 days.   \"His spirit is strong,\" his sister Shahmina Alam told Sky News, adding that Ahmad had started developing twitches. \"The prison has moved him to cells closer to the nurse's station to ensure he's able to have his vitals managed and respond to any emergency situations.\" \"Kamran is still determined,\" she said of his resolve. \"He feels this is the only way to exercise his demands.\" HMP Peterborough has said in a statement: \"We cannot provide information about specific individuals however we can confirm that all prisoners are managed in line with the policies and procedures governing the entire HMPPS managed prison estate.\" All eight hunger strikers were detained in prison on remand while they await trial for alleged break-ins or criminal damage carried out in the name of Palestine Action before the group was banned under terrorism legislation. By the time they are tried, all will have spent more than a year in custody. Three others who remain on hunger strike are Heba Muraisi, Lewie Chiaramello, who is type 1 diabetic and has been fasting every other day for 31 days and Teuta Hoxha, who has been on remand for 13 months. Hoxha is on day 46 of her hunger strike. After a prison visit on Wednesday, her sister Rahma, 17, told Sky News: \"She's losing an enormous amount of weight. She showed me her arms and I can see her bones sticking out. \"My sister is struggling to talk, has a constant headache and she's been having heart palpitations.\" Rahma added: \"She's very firm on her demands.\" Amy Gardiner-Gibson, who also goes by the name Amu Gib, began eating again on Wednesday after 49 days of going without food, according to the campaign group Prisoners for Palestine. In the past week, Qesser Zuhrah also paused her hunger strike after 48 days, hinting she might resume it in the new year. Umer Khalid and Jon Cink ended their strikes after 13 and 41 days, respectively. Palestine Action told Sky News that all pauses were carried out in hospital under medical supervision to prevent refeeding syndrome, a life-threatening shift of fluids and body salts (electrolytes) that can occur when malnourished patients receive treatment with refeeding. Over the course of the strike, seven members of the group have been taken to hospital and doctors have raised concerns about the long-term impact on their health.

The clip shows the boat teetering on the brink and the sound of cracking wood, before it tips into a hole about 50m long. Paul Smith-Storey, 58, described being woken by a \"big crash\" and a \"massive roar of water\". \"It felt like a disaster movie, especially when that boat dropped over the edge,\" he said. \"It's just incredible, these steel boats weigh about 17 tonnes and to see the force of water just carry that over the edge is quite scary.\" Another boat owner, Phil Johnson, 56, said water was flying past at \"horrendous speed\" and he saw the boat \"teetering on the edge\" before slowly disappearing. \"It's awful to say but it reminded me of that horrible scene from the Titanic film, because that's what it was like, when the back goes down and the bow comes up, and it finally just slid into the hole,\" he added.

        "Content": "The latest US-Ukraine peace plan suggests eastern areas seized by Russia could become free economic zones. President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said a \"demilitarised zone or a free economic zone\" could potentially resolve a stalemate over the future of the Donbas. Russia wants the whole region, even areas it has not captured, but Ukraine has said it is unacceptable. Details of the plan came as two police officers were killed in a bombing in Moscow on Wednesday, the second in three days after the killing of a general on Monday.  Ukraine has not confirmed it was behind the incidents, but has claimed responsibility for similar assassinations in the past. The bombings could be Kyiv's way of trying to shift the narrative in peace talks and showing it is still on the offensive and able to hit Russia at home, says Sky's Moscow correspondent Ivor Bennett. The revised 20-point plan was made public on Wednesday and follows recent US-Ukraine talks in Miami. President Zelenskyy said a US proposal for a free economic zone was a \"potential option\" for a sovereign Ukrainian state but it would have to be agreed via a referendum. Such zones typically have laws different to those in the rest of a country, such as less tax and relaxed customs and regulations. Mr Zelenskyy said the US and Ukraine had \"significantly brought most of the positions closer together\" but that negotiators still could not reach a consensus on territorial sticking points. He said he now wanted a meeting with Donald Trump as \"sensitive issues\" needed to be \"discussed at leaders' level\". The future of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, Europe's biggest, is another issue the US and Ukraine have not yet agreed on. America has suggested it should be a partner and chief manager in a consortium including Ukraine and Russia. The updated peace plan also includes robust security guarantees and Article 5-like protections to protect Ukraine from future aggression, as well as EU membership and keeping its army at 800,000 personnel. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said Moscow would set out its position based on information received by envoy Kirill Dmitriev, who met US officials in Florida over the weekend. US special envoy Steve Witkoff was part of a delegation that held talks with President Vladimir Putin at the start of December but there was no breakthrough and the Ukrainian people have continued to suffer. It was hit by one of the biggest aerial bombardments of the near four-year war this week, with more than 600 drones and several dozen missiles launched. Most were intercepted but at least three people, including a young child were killed, and there were widespread power cuts after hits on the electricity network. Read more from Sky News:British boy stabbed to death in Portugal namedFourth Palestine Action detainee pauses hunger strike President Zelenskyy also released a Christmas message of unity on Wednesday. \"Despite all the suffering that Russia has brought, it is not capable of occupying or bombing what matters most. That is our Ukrainian heart, our faith in one another, and our unity,\" he said in a video on Telegram. He added: \"In the skies over Kyiv and Zakarpattia, Odesa or Kupyansk - wherever we may be - Ukrainians are together tonight - marking Christmas on the same date, as one big family.\""

        "Content": "\n          Moscow correspondent\n              @IvorBennett\n A second fatal bombing on the streets of Moscow in the space of three days. We do not know the full details of this latest explosion but the fact these incidents keep happening will be highly embarrassing for the Kremlin. Monday's car bomb that killed Lieutenant General Fanil Sarvarov was the latest in a long line of high-profile hits on Russian soil since the Kremlin's invasion of Ukraine. Live updates: Ukraine war latest When a top military official was killed in similar circumstances this time last year, by a bomb hidden in a scooter, Vladimir Putin criticised Russia's security services and told them they should learn from their mistakes. It does not look like they have. Since then, there have been many more assassinations of senior officials - both in Moscow and further afield. This latest killing of two police officers in the same area as Monday's attack only makes things worse. \n                  Ksenia Karelina: Ballerina arrives home in US after 'nightmare' of Russian penal colony\n                 \n                  Do Russians believe Donald Trump can stop the war in Ukraine?\n                 \n                  Killing of Russian general Igor Kirillov will ring alarm bells inside embarrassed Kremlin\n                 It doesn't just look complacent. It's starting to appear incompetent. Although Ukraine has been behind some of the attacks, in this case, it has not commented. But could this have been Kyiv's way of trying to change the narrative in the peace talks? To show Donald Trump that Russia doesn't 'hold all the cards'? The timing has certainly been helpful for Ukraine, coinciding with the latest negotiations. So perhaps it's no coincidence that Kyiv has seemingly made progress in convincing Washington to agree to a less punishing peace proposal. Article 5-style security guarantees are a big win for Ukraine, as is an allowance to retain the strength of its armed forces. They are yet to convince the US on territory, but it's still progress nonetheless. Will Moscow agree to the other points? Don't hold your breath. Russia's position \"is well known\", the Kremlin said, when asked for its reaction to the latest proposals, suggesting it remains unmoved in its opposition to a security guarantee involving foreign troops. But even so, it seems the spotlight is back on Moscow."

        "Content": "By Yousra Elbagir, news correspondent, in Bethlehem  The thousands-year-old Christmas procession from Jerusalem to Bethlehem is finally being celebrated with festive fanfare after a two-year pause to mourn the devastating war in Gaza. The Latin Patriarch of Jerusalem, Cardinal Pierbattista Pizzaballa, was flanked by adoring crowds as he marched down the ancient, narrow cobblestoned roads to Manger Square in front of the Church of the Nativity and blessed the babies of Bethlehem along the way. After arriving, the cardinal stepped up on stage and told the full square of tourists and Palestinians from across the occupied West Bank: \"You are the light, we are the light. The light of Bethlehem is the light of the world.\" At the base of the Christmas tree towering over Manger Square for the first time since 2022, a nativity display with baby Jesus sitting above a decorated billboard emblazoned with the text: \"From here, the light of peace began.\"  Before the procession set off for Bethlehem, at the Mar Elias Monastery in East Jerusalem, the cardinal told me: \"This is a sign that we want to turn the page to look forward. \"The problems on the ground remain there but we need to react and respond to this situation and to look forward in order to find perspective and solutions for the terrible situation there.\" He has just returned from celebrating Christmas in the Holy Family Parish in Gaza, where 400 people are still being sheltered. The Gaza Health Ministry reports that at least 400 people have been killed and over 1,000 injured since the start of the ceasefire on 10 October. \"It was sad to see the disaster in which the population are living in,\" said the cardinal. \"I was very struck by the resilience and their desire of life. They are very strong and determined to rebuild everything.\" Here in the West Bank, violence is increasing as illegal Israeli settlements expand. On Sunday, Israel's far-right finance minister Bezalel Smotrich announced the approval of 19 more settlements - a move condemned by a group of 12 countries including Britain, Canada and Germany on Wednesday. As we drive, we see Israeli flags mark a new settlement on the hilltop shepherd fields of Bethlehem's Ush al Ghrab, where Jesus's birth was announced in the Bible. According to the United Nations Office for Co-ordination in Humanitarian Affairs (UNOCHA), 238 Palestinians, including 56 children were killed by Israeli forces or settlers in the West Bank in 2025. In Bethlehem's Tuqu' village, a mother grieves her 16-year-old son Ammar as Christmas is celebrated in the heart of the governate. He was shot by the IDF in a raid on 15 December. At his funeral, 24 hours later, his friend Muheeb Ahmed was reportedly shot and killed by a settler. The IDF told Sky News: \"During IDF activity in the area of Tekoa, a confrontation occurred in which rocks were hurled toward the soldiers. The soldiers used riot dispersal means and later on fired toward a main inciter, and a hit was identified. \"The incident is under review.\" Read more from Sky News:Canal boat falls into huge holeBritish 13-year-old boy stabbed to death in Portugal namedTeenagers killed in Tesla taxi crash in Surrey are named Ammar's mother tells us while cradling his photo: \"Why would you kill a child? \"He hasn't harmed you or is armed. What is a rock compared to gunpowder? It is nothing but they are cowards.\" \"When I see the [Christmas] celebrations, I get upset and cry. \"I have to be honest, it hurts to see people celebrating because Palestine is still bleeding and people are dying from the rain and hunger. We are one nation. Why would they put up the tree? Why would they celebrate?\" For Palestinian Christians gathering to celebrate, festivities still feel sombre but an opportunity to revive hope. \"It is a moment to pray and pray for peace, solidarity and hope,\" Monica Awad tells us in Manger Square as Christmas approaches. \"It hurts us so much to see our friends, family are still suffering in Gaza, even at this moment. But there is always hope. We believe in hope for a better future.\" The war in Gaza started following the 7 October attack in 2023, when more than 1,200 people, mostly civilians, were killed by Hamas militants and more than 250 were taken hostage. Health officials in Gaza say nearly 71,000 Palestinians have been killed since - a figure that does not differentiate between civilians and Hamas militants."

A spokesperson for the commission said it \"strongly\" condemns the US decision, adding: \"Freedom of expression is a fundamental right in Europe and a shared core value with the United States across the democratic world.\" The Europeans, who were labelled as \"radical\" activists by US Secretary of State Marco Rubio, include the EU commissioner responsible for supervising social media rules, Thierry Breton.

French President Emmanuel Macron said that the visa restrictions \"amount to intimidation and coercion aimed at undermining European digital sovereignty\". The EU's digital rules were adopted by \"a democratic and sovereign process\" involving all member countries and the European Parliament, he said in a post on X. Mr Macron said the rules \"ensure fair competition among platforms, without targeting any third country\" and that \"the rules governing the European Union's digital space are not meant to be determined outside Europe\". 'Rules not decided in Washington' Mr Breton and the other Europeans were affected by a new visa policy announced in May that bars entry to foreigners accused of censoring protected speech in the United States. Germany's justice ministry said the two German activists had the government's \"support and solidarity\" and that the visa bans on them were unacceptable. \"Anyone who describes this as censorship is misrepresenting our constitutional system,\" it said in a statement. \"The rules by which we want to live in the digital space in Germany and in Europe are not decided in Washington.\" A Global Disinformation Index spokesperson called the visa bans \"an authoritarian attack on free speech and an egregious act of government censorship\". \"The Trump administration is, once again, using the full weight of the federal government to intimidate, censor, and silence voices they disagree with,\" they said. \"Their actions today are immoral, unlawful, and un-American.\" Read more from Sky News:Epstein survivor speaks of moment she met AndrewBritish man faces deportation over alleged Nazi symbols Breton is not the first French national to face sanctions from the Trump administration.

The full release of the files could take a \"few more weeks\", the justice department said, further delaying compliance with a 19 December deadline set by Congress.  Just hours before the announcement, a dozen US senators called on the justice department's watchdog to examine its failure to meet Friday's deadline.

Inclusion in the files does not suggest any wrongdoing and have been released with little or no context. Live updates: Epstein files latest However, inside those 11,000 files were the testimonies of numerous alleged victims of Epstein - a convicted child sex offender. Sky News has collated some of the excerpts from those harrowing testimonies. Accuser says parents sold her for sex Two of the documents appear to be taken from an email sent by an alleged victim to Hope for Justice, a charity that aims to end human trafficking. The woman, whose identity has been redacted, has written up answers to \"preliminary questions\" the organisation says it needs to \"evaluate human trafficking situations for potential rescue\". The subject line of the email, which was sent in 2019, reads: \"I'm sorry this took so long, please let me know if you need anything else.\" We do not know any more context about what the witness recounts. She begins by saying she was \"born into sex trafficking\". \"I do not remember a time that I was not trafficked for sex. According to birth certificate from [REDACTED] my biological parents (I do not recognize them as parents) [REDACTED] began to sell me for sex in the town of [REDACTED],\" she writes. \"There were many men that were brought to their home to have sex with me. I was taken to many states in the US to sell me. I was forced by threat by [REDACTED], and Jeffery Epstein of being killed, bodily harm, and threats of harming other children if I did not have sex with them and any other people that they sold me to.\" The woman then recounts being \"taken to an underground location\", where Jeffrey Epstein raped her. There is no indication of when the events took place. Her written statement reads: \"In Virgin Islands, I was [REDACTED] they stopped there. I was 17 years old, [REDACTED] was blindfolded and taken to an underground location. It had steps that went down. \"I was raped by Jeffery [sic] Epstein, there were other men that raped me. I was kept in a stall so that men could look at me. \"He said I was an animal and that he was perfect, if I had sex with him that I wouldn't be such an animal. [REDACTED]. He said I wanted to be raped because I wanted to be more like him.\" Woman told FBI she was taken to Epstein's island at 13 In an email sent in October 2024, a threat intake examiner at the FBI National Threat Operations Center summarises an account given by a woman, who said she had been trafficked for sex and brought to Jeffrey Epstein's island when she was 13. The unnamed officer says the victim reported being trafficked from the age of five, after being taken from an apartment and \"cut in the throat\". They recount the woman said she was taken again at the age of 12 or 13 to Paris, where she was raped by three men. \"The men were a part of an organisation that would take naked photos of young girls and used [REDACTED] photo where she flew to Ireland for politicians and notable men,\" the email continues. \"They would have sex with the young women and she was taken from Ireland and brought to Jeffery [sic] Epstein Island when she was 13 years old. \"[REDACTED] said the only way to get off the island was to take naked photos or pose that is why there are so many photos laying around the house.\" Read more about the Epstein files:Files appear to show Andrew asking Ghislaine Maxwell for 'inappropriate friends'Epstein survivor on moment she met Andrew on private islandEpstein files don't join the dots to broader conspiracy - but his survivors could Witness, 14, was instructed to tell Epstein she was 17 Among the documents is a summary written in 2007 of an FBI interview with a witness who says she met Epstein at the age of 14. The woman, whose name has been redacted, told the FBI she was introduced to the paedophile by a 17-year-old girl, who asked her if she would like to make £300 by \"providing a man in Palm Beach with a massage\". \"She needed to dress sexy and provide a massage for an hour and she would make $300. [REDACTED] told [REDACTED] that Epstein might ask her to remove her shirt, but she could keep her bra on,\" the summary says. It continues: \"Epstein told [REDACTED] she was pretty. Epstein asked her age. [REDACTED] uttered \"four\" and then said 17. \"Epstein responded by saying, 'so you are fourteen'. \"[REDACTED] was previously instructed by [REDACTED] to tell Epstein she was 17. He told [REDACTED] that they would not tell anyone.\" The witness also told investigators: \"According to [REDACTED] if a girl felt uncomfortable and did not want to comply with Epstein's requests, he would ask them to bring other girls.\" 17-year-old approached in New York park Another document tells of a 17-year-old girl who says she was approached by a stranger in a New York park about a dog-walking job, and later sexually abused. The incident was reported in 2020 via a rape hotline run by the City of New York police department. The log entry reads: \"In 1992, C/V states when she was 17 y/o she met an unknown female in Central Park who offered her a dog walking position.\" \"C/V\" is thought to be an abbreviation of \"complainant/victim\". The entry continues: \"C/v states the female brought her back to a residence at Central Park West to meet her boss (Jeffrey Epstein) to be interviewed.\" It adds: \"C/v states while there she was offered something to drink. Afterwards, c/v states she felt dizzy and shaky. CN states she remembers feeling tired and leaning back. \"C/V states she remembers waking up in a room with someone heavy on her chest. C/v states she fell asleep again and remembers being brought to the bathroom to wash up. \"C/v states there was bleeding in her vaginal area. C/v states 2 women helped her get dressed and being sent away in a cab.\""

        "Content": "\n          US correspondent\n              @jamesmatthewsky\n Survivors of Jeffrey Epstein's abuse are already looking beyond the release of the files in their pursuit of justice. It would seem sensible.  For the second time, a tranche of images and documents was released by the US Department of Justice and, for the second time, it didn't detail the facts and failures which allowed Epstein to thrive. If those key elements were in there, they were redacted. The release of the files had been anticipated as a moment to unveil the whole story, to identify its characters and their crimes. But this is a book with pages missing and piecing together the broader network that enabled sex-trafficking on an industrial scale won't be easy. It remains the fierce ambition for survivors, aware that Epstein was no one-man operation. They know because they were there. \"I think the really important stuff wasn't released,\" Lisa Phillips told me. A survivor of Epstein's abuse, she said women who suffered at his hands had been sharing information and would have something to report in the New Year. \"We're still fighting, we're still doing our research and we will still bring whatever we find to the proper authorities. This is really important to us, we're all mothers now and have kids the same age as we were, so this fight is to the heart.\" They have seen their story wrapped in politics, in all its management and manipulation. The resistance to publish, the timing of release, the redactions - they are matters beyond their control that could scarcely matter more.

While they each say something about Epstein, his crimes and depravity, they don't join the dots to the broader conspiracy. No one is better placed to do that than its victims. This news story is their story. Ultimately, it may be for them to tell because we're hearing it from no one else."

        "Content": "\n          Chief political correspondent\n              @joncraig\n The boss of Britain's trade unions has urged those who are celebrating Christmas to spare a thought for those who have to work – including clergy at church services. Paul Nowak says 1.2 million people will be working on Christmas Day, many of them care workers, nurses and other NHS staff. Speaking to Sky News, the Trades Union Congress (TUC) general secretary said: \"On Christmas Day, most of us will be spending it with our loved ones, our friends and family and enjoying the day. \"But there'll be more than a million people at work, many of them, for example, in care homes or in retail, preparing for the Boxing Day sales. \"And it's really important that we recognise the contribution of those workers as we go into Christmas.\" Speaking at the TUC's Congress House HQ, Mr Nowak said many of those working will be on zero-hours contracts or in low-paid jobs. \"For those workers, hopefully they'll be getting a Christmas present this year in the form of the government's Employment Rights Act, which will get rid of exploitative zero-hours contracts and hopefully drive up pay and tackle insecure employment,\" he said. Asked about the clergy, Mr Nowak said: \"There are members of the clergy who are union members, and of course, being a member of the clergy is a vocation, but it's also a job. \"And alongside those who will be delivering sermons on Christmas Day, there'll be people opening up churches and keeping people safe and making sure the heating's turned on. \"So, it's important to spare a thought for those workers as well.\" Read more:Starmer thanks those working on Christmas dayFarmers celebrate Christmas U-turn on tax He also claimed the Employment Rights Act, which received Royal Assent last week, as the perfect Christmas present for many people working over the festive season. Mr Nowak said: \"For many of the workers who are working at Christmas, they will be in low-paid, insecure employment. \"They're precisely the sort of workers who will benefit most on the government's Employment Rights Act. Up to eight million workers next April will get sick pay from day one for the first time ever, thanks to that Act. \"And there'll be a whole new host of other rights coming online during the course of the next 18 months or two years, including an end to exploitative zero-hours contracts. \"So this is a really big step forward for low-paid workers in this country.\""
