        "Content": " Reform UK has hit back at both the Archbishop of York and the government following criticism of its immigration policies. Speaking on Sky News, Richard Tice, Reform's deputy leader, told Sunday Morning With Trevor Phillips that Stephen Cottrell, who is the acting head of the Church of England, was \"wrong\" with his criticism of his party's deportation policy for illegal migrants. It comes after party leader Nigel Farage announced Reform's flagship immigration plan during a flashy news conference held at an aircraft hangar in Oxford on Tuesday. Politics latest - follow live updates  The party pledged to deport anybody who comes to the UK illegally, regardless of whether they might come to harm, and said it would pay countries with questionable human rights records - such as Afghanistan - to take people back. It also said it would leave numerous international agreements, and revoke the Human Rights Act, in order to do this. \n                  Child 'may have been affected' by pepper spray and officer punched in face as Canary Wharf anti-asylum protest boil over\n                 \n                  Tice's pushback against Church of England criticism wasn't political bareknuckle brawl we often see from Reform\n                 \n                  Sir Keir Starmer promises small boat migrants will be 'detained and sent back'\n                 The policy was criticised by the Conservatives, who said Mr Farage was \"copying our homework\", while parties such as the Liberal Democrats and the Greens condemned it. But the plan came under fire from an altogether different angle on Saturday, when the Archbishop of York accused it of being an \"isolationist, short-term kneejerk\" approach, with no \"long-term solutions\".  Mr Cottrell told the same Sky News programme he had \"every sympathy\" with those who find the issue of immigration tricky. But he said Reform UK's plan did \"nothing to address the issue of what brings people to this country\", and would in fact, make \"the problem worse\". On Sunday, Mr Tice responded to the archbishop's criticisms, saying that \"all of it is wrong\". The MP for Boston and Skegness said he was a Christian who \"enjoys\" the church - but that the \"role of the archbishop is not actually to interfere with international migration policies\". Mr Tice then turned his fire on the government, accusing ministers of being \"more interested in protecting the rights of people who've come here illegally... than looking after the rights of British citizens\". He accused ministers of having \"abandoned\" their duty of \"looking after the interests of British citizens\".  Mr Tice reaffirmed his party's policy that the UK should leave the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR), calling it a \"70-year-old, out-of-date, unfit-for-purpose agreement\". The Reform UK deputy leader also: â€¢ Defended plans to pay the Taliban to take migrants back, comparing it to doing business deals with \"people you don't like\" â€¢ Said the Royal Navy should be deployed in the English Channel as a \"deterrent\", but added: \"We're not saying sink the boats\" â€¢ Urged the government to call an early general election  Meanwhile, Bridget Phillipson, the education secretary, told Sky News that Reform \"want to provoke anger, but they don't actually want to solve the problems that we face in front of us\". She told Sunday Morning With Trevor Phillips the UK had a \"proud tradition [of] supporting those facing persecution\". But she added: \"We will make sure that people who have no right to be in this country are removed from this country. That's right. It's what people expect. It's what this government will deliver.\" Ms Phillipson also insisted there \"needs to be reform of the ECHR\" and said the home secretary is \"looking at the article eight provisions\", which cover the right to a private and family life, to see \"whether they need updating and reforming for the modern age\". ðŸ‘‰ Listen to Sky News Daily on your podcast app ðŸ‘ˆ  However, she refused to say what the government would do if it is found that the ECHR is unreformable. Instead, she defended Labour's position of staying in the governance of the convention, saying that honouring the \"rule of law\" is important. She added: \"Our standing in the world matters if we want to strike trade deals with countries. We need to be a country that's taken seriously. We need to be a country that honours our obligations and honours the rule of law.\"   Ms Phillipson was also drawn on the recent court ruling in favour of the Home Office, which overturned an injunction banning The Bell Hotel in Epping from housing asylum seekers. Challenged on whether the government is prioritising the rights of asylum seekers over British citizens, she said it \"is about a balance of rights\". The cabinet minister also repeated the government's plans to end the use of hotels to house asylum seekers by 2029.  Shadow Cabinet Office minister Alex Burghart said the Conservatives would be willing to leave the ECHR - if this route is recommended to them. The Tories have asked a senior judge to look into the \"legal intricacies\" of leaving the convention, which he said is \"not straightforward\". He said when the party receives that report, it will then make a decision. Challenged on whether the Tories will leave if that is what the report recommends, he added: \"If that's what's necessary, we will do it.\" Mr Burghart also said he believed the previous Conservative government's biggest mistake was that \"we did not go far enough on overruling human rights legislation\", which prevented it from \"taking the tough action that was absolutely necessary\". But he added the Conservatives have now \"put forward very clear legislation that would solve this problem\" - though he concluded Labour \"isn't going to do it\" so the problem \"is going to get worse\"."

        "Content": "A child \"may have been affected\" by synthetic pepper spray, police said - as protests inside inside Canary Wharf shopping centre boiled over, with an officer separately being punched in the face.  Police said a group of masked protesters became \"aggressive\" towards police at the shopping complex after an anti-asylum demonstration. A group of people entered the shopping centre around 4.30pm and a \"small number of masked protesters\" then became aggressive towards members of the public and police, the Metropolitan Police said in a statement. Police issued an order to \"prevent people concealing their identity with masks\" and a dispersal order was also put in place. Video seen on social media showed young children among the protesters, with some of them wearing England flags. In a statement on Sunday night, the Met said: \"Officers witnessed an assault by a protester on a member of the public inside Canary Wharf shopping centre. \"The suspect was immediately arrested by officers who used PAVA spray. \"We are aware other protesters and members of the public, including a child, may have been temporarily affected by the use of PAVA given the density of the crowds in the area.\" Police say four arrested Police said four people were arrested on Sunday afternoon during the protests, including for common assault by a protester on a member of the public, possession of class A and B drugs, assault on police/public order offences and failure to disperse. \"One of our officers was punched in the face - luckily they did not suffer significant injury,\" a spokesperson said. Commander Adam Slonecki, in charge of policing London this weekend, said: \"We had plenty of officers on the ground who moved in swiftly to deal with the criminality that occurred inside and outside the shopping centre. We will not tolerate this kind of behaviour. \"Today's protest saw many community members attend, including women and children, and we worked to ensure the safety of those there to peacefully represent their views. Those who arrive at protests masked and intent on causing trouble will continue to be dealt with robustly at future protests.\" Read more:PM promises small boat migrants will be 'detained and sent back'Reform deputy leader disagrees with archbishop Protesters from both sides of the divide over the UK's immigration policies gathered outside the Britannia Hotel in Canary Wharf on Sunday afternoon. Around a dozen anti-immigration protesters were joined by about 100 counter-protesters holding banners saying \"stand up to racism\" and \"stop the far right\" on the other side of the road. Demonstrators then left the hotel location - kept apart by police. Sunday's events in east London follow an incident in West Drayton, west London, on Saturday when a group of masked men were among those who attempted to enter a hotel housing asylum seekers. Further protests in Epping Protesters also gathered again outside the Bell Hotel in Epping, which has seen repeated demonstrations over the housing of asylum seekers. Essex Police however said that Sunday's protests there must end by 8pm. Later, around 200 people gathered outside the Epping Forest District Council building, where a woman climbed the steps and unfurled a Union flag. In a statement, Essex Police said: \"A significant number of people attended the town with three arrests being made, including two men and one woman. \"With regards to the arrest of the woman at the Civic Centre, we're aware of suggestions around the reason for her arrest. \"The arrest is on suspicion of breaching a Section 14 order, which is in place this evening. That order set out specific areas where protest activity could take place, which did not include the Civic Centre. \"Her arrest was categorically not for flying a Union Flag.\""

        "Content": "Rudy Giuliani has been taken to hospital after a car crash in New Hampshire, a spokesperson for the former New York City mayor said. Mr Giuliani suffered \"a fractured thoracic vertebrae, multiple lacerations and contusions, as well as injuries to his left arm and lower leg\" when his vehicle was struck from behind while driving on a highway near Manchester, New York, on Saturday evening, according to Michael Ragusa, Mr Giuliani's head of security. \"He sustained injuries but is in good spirits and recovering tremendously,\" Mr Ragusa said in a statement on X, adding: \"This was not a targeted attack.\" Mr Giuliani was in a rental car and \"no one knew it was him\", according to Mr Ragusa.  His head of security said the 81-year-old had been \"flagged down by a woman who was the victim of a domestic violence incident\" and contacted police on her behalf. The crash shortly after was \"random and unrelated\" to the domestic violence incident, Mr Ragusa said. Mr Giuliani, who worked as a lawyer for Donald Trump in his failed efforts to overturn the results of the 2020 election, is expected to be released from hospital in a few days. His son, Andrew Giuliani, thanked people for reaching out after hearing about his father's accident, writing on X: \"Your prayers mean the world.\" \"As a son, I can tell you that I'm honored to have a Dad that I can call the toughest SOB I've ever seen,\" he added. The crash on Saturday follows some tumultuous years for Mr Giuliani, who was once dubbed \"America's mayor\" due to his leadership in New York after the 9/11 attacks in 2001. He was in the running to be the Republican presidential candidate in the 2008 election, but missed out and eventually endorsed John McCain. It was quiet around Mr Giuliani until he emerged as Mr Trump's personal lawyer in 2018, later supporting his allegations of fraud in the 2020 election, which was won by Democrat Joe Biden. But Mr Trump's team lost dozens of lawsuits claiming fraud, and despite numerous recounts, reviews and audits of the 2020 election results, no signs of significant wrongdoing or error were found. Two Georgia election workers successfully sued Mr Giuliani for defamation after he accused them of lying to help the presidential election, and he was ordered to pay them $148m (Â£118m) in damages.

He was later found in contempt of court and faced a trial this winter over the ownership of some of his assets. Mr Giuliani and the two election workers ultimately struck a deal, as part of which he can keep his homes and various high-value belongings, and the women receive unspecified compensation and a promise Mr Giuliani would stop speaking ill of them."

        "Content": "\n          India reporter and producer\n              @nevilleskynews\n The blossoming relationship between Donald Trump and Indian prime minister Narendra Modi has abruptly turned sour.  After the heady days of the \"Howdy Modi\" event in Houston, and the mega \"Namaste Trump\" show in Ahmedabad, where a stadium was packed with over 100,000 people to welcome the US president and his family, the humiliation by his \"true friend\" has left the Indian leader seething. For over a decade, Mr Modi has meticulously crafted his image as a global leader rubbing shoulders with, and hugging, world leaders. He now finds himself humiliated by the planet's most powerful man. Ukraine war latest: Putin arrives in China for rare visit  The opposition parties have wasted no time in rubbing salt into that wound, egging Mr Modi to retaliate in the national interest. But so far he has maintained his silence. The indignity began in May after the four-day conflict between Indian and Pakistan. Mr Trump announced on social media that he brokered a ceasefire between two nuclear-armed arch-rivals that was spiralling. This was even before the ceasefire was put in place by the leaders of both countries. Pakistan's Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif instantly thanked the US president for bringing peace to the region and went on to nominate him for the Nobel Peace Prize. Both countries are now exploring crypto and mining deals. \n                  How Moscow and its allies are trying to display their immunity to Western pressure\n                 \n                  China and India discuss disputed border at key summit - as Putin talks about Trump\n                 \n                  China summit has been called 'axis of upheaval' - and that feels right when you look at guest list\n                 Mr Modi has remained silent, his government instead credited its military for forcing Pakistan to concede. Even as Mr Trump has spoken of his intervention publicly over 30 times now. Moreover, he has offered to intervene in the decades-old Kashmir dispute, a taboo subject in India. India is 'Kremlin's laundromat' Then came the swift punishment of an extra 25% tariff levied on India for buying discounted Russian crude oil, taking the total duties to 50%, one of the highest in the world. The US government justified its actions as a national security concern that is fuelling the war in Ukraine and so applied aggressive economic leverage. Mr Trump's trade adviser Peter Navarro described the Russia-Ukraine conflict as \"Modi's war\", and said \"the road to peace runs, at least partly, right through New Delhi\". \"India's Big Oil lobby has turned the largest democracy in the world into a massive refining hub and oil money laundromat for the Kremlin. It's really easy. India can get 25% off tomorrow if it stops buying Russian oil,\" he added. Though China is the largest buyer of Russian oil, it has been left untouched. In 2021, Russian crude accounted for just 3% of India's imports, but this has risen to about 40% in 2024 - making Moscow the country's largest supplier. India says it buys cheap Russian crude for its own energy security and is now pushing for a swadeshi mantra, or self-reliance, reducing the burden of import. Sensing the unpredictability of the US president, the punitive actions and humiliation by his administration, New Delhi is recalibrating. In the run-up to the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) meeting, there have been a flurry of personal meetings between the Indian, Chinese and Russian foreign ministers. Mr Modi's visit to China is his first in seven years and the first since the deadly clashes in May 2020 between soldiers of both militaries in which 20 Indian soldiers lost their lives, resulting in an uproar in the country for retribution. The relations went into deep freeze. The two Asian giants share over 2,000 miles of border, much demarcated and with unresolved land disputes. India-Russia relations There is much history to the special relationship between India and Russia. During the Cold War, India was clubbed in the Soviet Union camp, while America favoured arch rival Pakistan. Both have stood the test of time and supported each other in international forums against western powers on contentious issues. The relationship strengthened particularly in the defence sector. According to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute, Russia supplied 65% of India's weapons purchases during the last two decades. Though India is trying to wean itself off by shopping for military hardware from Western countries, it is a time-consuming process with complicated issues of technology transfers involved. 'Dance of the dragon and elephant' In his bilateral meeting with the Indian leader on Sunday, China's leader Xi Jinping said: \"The two countries must deepen mutual trust, and make opportunities for each other's development rather than threats. \"We should accommodate each other's concerns and uphold peaceful coexistence. Jointly safeguard peace and tranquillity in border areas, ensuring that boundary issues do not define the entirety of China-India. \"Being good neighbours and friends, partners who achieve mutual success, and realising the 'dance of the dragon and the elephant' should be the right choice for both China and India.\" Mr Modi added \"both countries should pursue strategic autonomy, and their relations should not be seen through a third country lens\". The SCO meeting and bilaterals between Mr Modi, President Xi and Russian President Vladmir Putin will be analysed in minute detail, but intense scrutiny will also be on the reaction of the US president."

        "Content": " The UK's anti-slavery commissioner has launched an investigation into so-called pimping websites. Eleanor Lyons told Sky News presenter Gareth Barlow she wants to find the \"hotbeds of exploitation\" among the hundreds of adult services websites operating in the UK, where users are offered women for sale by simply typing in their postcode. The independent commissioner described the sites as \"chilling\" and said 5,000 women and girls were identified as victims of sexual exploitation in the last year alone, which is likely just the \"tip of the iceberg\".   \"In fact, this number has been rising year on year, and part of the issue has been that the online world has made it easier for criminals and traffickers to identify and sell those victims of sexual exploitation online,\" she said. \"And it is alarming that adult service websites are operating freely in the UK, allowing for victims of sexual exploitation to be advertised.\" The probe comes after a Sky News investigation uncovered thousands of potential indicators of sexual exploitation on two of the UK's most prominent adult service websites, raising serious concerns about how traffickers may be using the platforms to advertise and abuse victims. Ms Lyons said some of the sites take their obligations seriously but others are ignoring trafficking red flags. Read more from Sky News:Two men stabbed at same Tube station within 24 hoursBaby whose mother was unvaccinated dies of whooping cough They include the same language being used to advertise women in different parts of the country, multiple women being advertised on the same phone number and reports of coercive control in the reviews. Prostitution is legal in England and Wales. But the controlling of prostitution for gain, sometimes called pimping, and the more severe crime of trafficking, are not. Ms Lyons said the Online Safety Act puts some duties on the adult services websites but is calling for stronger regulations and laws to be properly enforced. \"I speak to survivors of sexual exploitation as part of my work, and they tell me that they were advertised online against their will,\" she said. \"Now, as adult service websites were part of this exploitation and so there are clear gaps, there are clear problems in this area, and we need the government to look at this more seriously. \"We need to identify those issues so that we're helping victims of exploitation who are going through some really horrific things on a day-to-day basis in communities right across the country.\" Ms Lyons said she plans to speak to survivors, police and Ofcom, as well as mapping adult services websites, as part of the investigation, with her report expected to be published later this year. A spokesperson for the adult services website Vivastreet told Sky News it \"takes safety extremely seriously\". \"We deploy a range of measures to detect, report and remove potentially exploitative content, including requiring all adult category advertisers to undergo age and ID verification,\" they said. \"All our adverts are screened via a range of indicators informed by police advice, with suspicious content referred proactively to a central policing unit. Since 2022, we have referred over 4,600 accounts via this industry-first referral pathway.\" Vivastreet also said experts were \"clear\" that indicators suggesting exploitation could have \"innocent explanations\". \"For example, many sex workers advertise using different names and personas, and 'touring' - moving for short periods of time to different areas to take bookings - is a well-known practice,\" the spokesperson said. \"Our adverts are purchased and displayed in narrow geographical areas, and so any advertiser who wishes to reach an audience outside their precise location will need to buy more than one, meaning their phone number will appear more than once on the platform.\""

        "Content": "\n          Moscow correspondent\n              @IvorBennett\n  Vladimir Putin doesn't do four-day getaways to a single country very often. His last was 20 years ago, to attend the 60th anniversary session of the UN General Assembly in New York in 2005. The fact that his current visit to China is that long says a lot. So does the timing - barely two weeks after the Russian president met Donald Trump in Alaska. Follow the latest: Putin arrives in China to meet 'axis of upheaval'  It feels like a very deliberate illustration of how close Moscow is to Beijing in the face of US attempts to weaken the relationship and its drive to end the war in Ukraine. With China, the American president has tried the stick. Threats of tariffs and secondary sanctions over its continued purchasing of Russian oil. And with Russia, apparently, the carrot too. As well as renewed warnings of \"massive\" sanctions on Moscow, the Reuters news agency last week reported that US and Russian officials also discussed energy deals during recent negotiations, in the hope of incentivising the Kremlin to agree a peace deal, and to start diluting its bond with Beijing. But Putin's programme in China appears designed to emphasise that his relationship with Xi Jinping is stronger than ever. After the two-day Shanghai Cooperation Organisation security summit, the pair will hold face-to-face talks on Tuesday, before Putin takes his place as guest of honour at a military parade on Wednesday that marks the 80th anniversary of Japan's formal surrender in the Second World War. The symbolism is clear - Russia and China fought shoulder-to-shoulder against the enemies of the past, and they'll remain united against the threats of the future. There'll be other powerful photo-ops too, namely with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who is among a string of leaders Vladimir Putin will hold bilateral talks with. A handshake and a smile on the summit sidelines just days after Trump hit India with 50% tariffs for buying Russian oil will be the diplomatic equivalent of blowing a raspberry in Washington's direction. For Russia, the whole visit feels like a pointed show of solidarity amid sanctions - that Moscow and its allies are immune to Western pressure. But amid the symbolism, the Kremlin will be looking for substance here too. Bilateral trade with China, which has helped keep the Russian economy afloat since the invasion of Ukraine, has started to fall in recent months. Read more from Sky News:Russia has made Trump look weakHow Trump and Modi's bromance fell apart After hitting a record high of $245bn in 2024, trade volumes have dipped by 8% since January. And that's particularly worrying for Moscow, with signs the economy could be on the brink of recession. Putin will be hoping to arrest that slump and expand trade into new areas. Most of all, though, I think he'll be seeking a commitment from Russia's economic partners that they won't be going anywhere should the pressure increase."

The earthquake struck the east of the country near the Pakistan border at 11.47pm local time (8.17pm UK time) on Sunday, the German Research Centre for Geosciences said. At least nine people were killed and 25 were injured in Nangarhar province, according to Ajmal Darwaish, spokesman for the regional health department. The quake's epicentre was near Jalalabad, Nangarhar province, at a depth of 14km (8.7 miles). Jalalabad is about 119km (74 miles) away from the capital city, Kabul. There was a second earthquake in the same province about 20 minutes later, with a magnitude of 4.5 and a depth of 10km (6.2 miles). This was later followed by a 5.2 earthquake at the same depth. A magnitude 6.3 earthquake and strong aftershocks struck Afghanistan on 7 October 2023. The country's Taliban government said at least 4,000 people had been killed, but the United Nations said the death toll was around 1,500. The 2023 earthquake is considered the deadliest natural disaster to hit Afghanistan in recent memory."

From 1 September, the small dispensers often included in takeaway sushi meals will be phased out in the state.

The latest move will also cover non-compostable fruit and vegetable stickers and prepackaged cups and bowls for takeaway meals. Fish-shaped sauce containers were invented in Japan in the 1950s and were first made of glass or ceramics before they were plastic.

        "Content": " Reform UK has hit back at both the Archbishop of York and the government following criticism of its immigration policies. Speaking on Sky News, Richard Tice, Reform's deputy leader, told Sunday Morning With Trevor Phillips that Stephen Cottrell, who is the acting head of the Church of England, was \"wrong\" with his criticism of his party's deportation policy for illegal migrants. It comes after party leader Nigel Farage announced Reform's flagship immigration plan during a flashy news conference held at an aircraft hangar in Oxford on Tuesday. Politics latest - follow live updates  The party pledged to deport anybody who comes to the UK illegally, regardless of whether they might come to harm, and said it would pay countries with questionable human rights records - such as Afghanistan - to take people back. It also said it would leave numerous international agreements, and revoke the Human Rights Act, in order to do this. \n                  Child 'may have been affected' by pepper spray and officer punched in face as Canary Wharf anti-asylum protest boil over\n                 \n                  Tice's pushback against Church of England criticism wasn't political bareknuckle brawl we often see from Reform\n                 \n                  Sir Keir Starmer promises small boat migrants will be 'detained and sent back'\n                 The policy was criticised by the Conservatives, who said Mr Farage was \"copying our homework\", while parties such as the Liberal Democrats and the Greens condemned it. But the plan came under fire from an altogether different angle on Saturday, when the Archbishop of York accused it of being an \"isolationist, short-term kneejerk\" approach, with no \"long-term solutions\".  Mr Cottrell told the same Sky News programme he had \"every sympathy\" with those who find the issue of immigration tricky. But he said Reform UK's plan did \"nothing to address the issue of what brings people to this country\", and would in fact, make \"the problem worse\". On Sunday, Mr Tice responded to the archbishop's criticisms, saying that \"all of it is wrong\". The MP for Boston and Skegness said he was a Christian who \"enjoys\" the church - but that the \"role of the archbishop is not actually to interfere with international migration policies\". Mr Tice then turned his fire on the government, accusing ministers of being \"more interested in protecting the rights of people who've come here illegally... than looking after the rights of British citizens\". He accused ministers of having \"abandoned\" their duty of \"looking after the interests of British citizens\".  Mr Tice reaffirmed his party's policy that the UK should leave the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR), calling it a \"70-year-old, out-of-date, unfit-for-purpose agreement\". The Reform UK deputy leader also: â€¢ Defended plans to pay the Taliban to take migrants back, comparing it to doing business deals with \"people you don't like\" â€¢ Said the Royal Navy should be deployed in the English Channel as a \"deterrent\", but added: \"We're not saying sink the boats\" â€¢ Urged the government to call an early general election  Meanwhile, Bridget Phillipson, the education secretary, told Sky News that Reform \"want to provoke anger, but they don't actually want to solve the problems that we face in front of us\". She told Sunday Morning With Trevor Phillips the UK had a \"proud tradition [of] supporting those facing persecution\". But she added: \"We will make sure that people who have no right to be in this country are removed from this country. That's right. It's what people expect. It's what this government will deliver.\" Ms Phillipson also insisted there \"needs to be reform of the ECHR\" and said the home secretary is \"looking at the article eight provisions\", which cover the right to a private and family life, to see \"whether they need updating and reforming for the modern age\". ðŸ‘‰ Listen to Sky News Daily on your podcast app ðŸ‘ˆ  However, she refused to say what the government would do if it is found that the ECHR is unreformable. Instead, she defended Labour's position of staying in the governance of the convention, saying that honouring the \"rule of law\" is important. She added: \"Our standing in the world matters if we want to strike trade deals with countries. We need to be a country that's taken seriously. We need to be a country that honours our obligations and honours the rule of law.\"   Ms Phillipson was also drawn on the recent court ruling in favour of the Home Office, which overturned an injunction banning The Bell Hotel in Epping from housing asylum seekers. Challenged on whether the government is prioritising the rights of asylum seekers over British citizens, she said it \"is about a balance of rights\". The cabinet minister also repeated the government's plans to end the use of hotels to house asylum seekers by 2029.  Shadow Cabinet Office minister Alex Burghart said the Conservatives would be willing to leave the ECHR - if this route is recommended to them. The Tories have asked a senior judge to look into the \"legal intricacies\" of leaving the convention, which he said is \"not straightforward\". He said when the party receives that report, it will then make a decision. Challenged on whether the Tories will leave if that is what the report recommends, he added: \"If that's what's necessary, we will do it.\" Mr Burghart also said he believed the previous Conservative government's biggest mistake was that \"we did not go far enough on overruling human rights legislation\", which prevented it from \"taking the tough action that was absolutely necessary\". But he added the Conservatives have now \"put forward very clear legislation that would solve this problem\" - though he concluded Labour \"isn't going to do it\" so the problem \"is going to get worse\"."

        "Content": " The UK's anti-slavery commissioner has launched an investigation into so-called pimping websites. Eleanor Lyons told Sky News presenter Gareth Barlow she wants to find the \"hotbeds of exploitation\" among the hundreds of adult services websites operating in the UK, where users are offered women for sale by simply typing in their postcode. The independent commissioner described the sites as \"chilling\" and said 5,000 women and girls were identified as victims of sexual exploitation in the last year alone, which is likely just the \"tip of the iceberg\".   \"In fact, this number has been rising year on year, and part of the issue has been that the online world has made it easier for criminals and traffickers to identify and sell those victims of sexual exploitation online,\" she said. \"And it is alarming that adult service websites are operating freely in the UK, allowing for victims of sexual exploitation to be advertised.\" The probe comes after a Sky News investigation uncovered thousands of potential indicators of sexual exploitation on two of the UK's most prominent adult service websites, raising serious concerns about how traffickers may be using the platforms to advertise and abuse victims. Ms Lyons said some of the sites take their obligations seriously but others are ignoring trafficking red flags. Read more from Sky News:Two men stabbed at same Tube station within 24 hoursBaby whose mother was unvaccinated dies of whooping cough They include the same language being used to advertise women in different parts of the country, multiple women being advertised on the same phone number and reports of coercive control in the reviews. Prostitution is legal in England and Wales. But the controlling of prostitution for gain, sometimes called pimping, and the more severe crime of trafficking, are not. Ms Lyons said the Online Safety Act puts some duties on the adult services websites but is calling for stronger regulations and laws to be properly enforced. \"I speak to survivors of sexual exploitation as part of my work, and they tell me that they were advertised online against their will,\" she said. \"Now, as adult service websites were part of this exploitation and so there are clear gaps, there are clear problems in this area, and we need the government to look at this more seriously. \"We need to identify those issues so that we're helping victims of exploitation who are going through some really horrific things on a day-to-day basis in communities right across the country.\" Ms Lyons said she plans to speak to survivors, police and Ofcom, as well as mapping adult services websites, as part of the investigation, with her report expected to be published later this year. A spokesperson for the adult services website Vivastreet told Sky News it \"takes safety extremely seriously\". \"We deploy a range of measures to detect, report and remove potentially exploitative content, including requiring all adult category advertisers to undergo age and ID verification,\" they said. \"All our adverts are screened via a range of indicators informed by police advice, with suspicious content referred proactively to a central policing unit. Since 2022, we have referred over 4,600 accounts via this industry-first referral pathway.\" Vivastreet also said experts were \"clear\" that indicators suggesting exploitation could have \"innocent explanations\". \"For example, many sex workers advertise using different names and personas, and 'touring' - moving for short periods of time to different areas to take bookings - is a well-known practice,\" the spokesperson said. \"Our adverts are purchased and displayed in narrow geographical areas, and so any advertiser who wishes to reach an audience outside their precise location will need to buy more than one, meaning their phone number will appear more than once on the platform.\""

        "Content": "\n          Political correspondent\n              @robpowellnews\n Reform is usually happy to get into a punch-up over its policies. The mantra that \"any publicity is good publicity\" seemingly inked into the party playbook. That may be why they seem reasonably relaxed about recent criticism of their migration plans by the Church of England. Speaking on Tuesday, Nigel Farage delicately suggested that in recent years church leaders had been \"out of touch with their own flock\".  That, likely a not-so-subtle reference to the former head of the church Justin Welby - who made frequent interventions into the migration debate. Follow live politics updates: Tice says archbishop's criticism is 'all wrong' Farage's deputy Richard Tice did push back against comments made by the Archbishop of York to Sky News. But this wasn't the political bareknuckle brawl we frequently see from this insurgent party. \n                  Child 'may have been affected' by pepper spray and officer punched in face as Canary Wharf anti-asylum protest boil over\n                 \n                  Reform deputy Richard Tice hits back after Archbishop of York's intervention on migrant policy\n                 \n                  Sir Keir Starmer promises small boat migrants will be 'detained and sent back'\n                 Squaring up to a man of the cloth is perhaps not a good look when you're trying to win the votes of more moderate shire Tories. It seems Reform isn't the only party turning a blind eye to criticism from the clergy though. This weekend, Sir Keir Starmer appeared to toughen his language on migration again - posting online that \"if you cross the Channel unlawfully, you will be detained and sent back\". The issue for the prime minister is - as it stands - that just isn't true. Recent data shows that for those crossing the Channel, the most likely outcome is that they will be approved for asylum and allowed to stay - following a period where their accommodation will be paid for by the public.  If you want a visual indication of this uncomfortable truth just look at the face of the education secretary as Sky's Trevor Phillips asked if she agreed with the argument of the government's own lawyers in court that the rights of asylum seekers in the Bell Hotel in Epping outweigh local concerns on this occasion. It took a few attempts, but Bridget Phillipson eventually confirmed that she did. Little wonder that some Labour big beasts are increasingly reaching the conclusion that if issues around rights are stopping action then perhaps those rights need looking at. Read more analysis:How Trump's humiliation of Modi pushed him into arms of PutinChina summit dubbed 'axis of upheaval', which feels right The last week saw former foreign secretary Jack Straw join former home secretary David Blunkett in calling for a suspension of the European Convention on Human Rights. Sir Keir Starmer's predecessor as director of public prosecutions Lord Macdonald has also suggested new laws are needed to replace the Refugee Convention - another international agreement often cited in asylum cases. All of this may prove too much for a prime minister who literally wrote the book on European human rights law. Home Office sources are instead arguing that there are tentative signs that their current approach may be working, with August channel crossings lower than they have been in previous years. If that trend continues, ministers may buy themselves some time - and some space from the attacks emanating from Reform. If it doesn't, then the clamber for plan B will become more pronounced."

The infant, who is believed to have been under the age of one, died between March and June, according to the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA). It is the first baby whooping cough death in the UK this year. According to the UKHSA, 33 babies died of the disease between 2013 and June 2025. Vaccination for whooping cough, or pertussis, is given as part of the '6-in-1' jab for babies at eight, 12, and 16 weeks old. Specific whooping cough vaccines were introduced for pregnant women in October 2012 to protect their children before they have had all three doses. Of the 33 babies who died between 2013 and 2025, 27 had mothers who were not vaccinated in pregnancy, including the one this year.

Our thoughts and condolences are with the family who have so tragically lost their baby.\" Whooping cough is an infection of the lungs and breathing tubes and can be serious for infants as they are more vulnerable. The whooping cough death comes after the NHS announced it will roll out chickenpox vaccines to babies for the first time. Major concerns have been raised by health professionals over declining childhood vaccination rates, with data showing none of the routine infant jabs were on target in England last year. Rates of measles are up nationwide, with a child death reported at Alder Hey Children's Hospital in Liverpool in July. The vaccine against chickenpox, or varicella, will be added to the combined one for mumps, measles, and rubella from January 2026 and made available for all 12 to 18-month-olds."

Rail, Maritime And Transport (RMT) union walkouts next Sunday and Monday make it impossible for fans to get to and from the venue safely, the band said in a statement. The completion of their Wembley run will see Coldplay become the first act to play 10 dates at the national football stadium in the same year, knocking current joint record holders Taylor Swift and Take That from the top spot. Both Swift and Take That have played eight Wembley shows in a single year. Industrial action on the Tube will take place at different times from 5 September for seven days, impacting Coldplay's gigs - which are part of the band's eco-friendly Music Of The Spheres world tour - on 7 and 8 September.

Returned tickets are to go on general sale at 11am on 3 September via Ticketmaster. The band confirmed shows on 30 and 31 August, and 3 September and 4 September would go ahead as scheduled. Some 10% of the band's proceeds from the Wembley shows will be donated to the Music Venue Trust to help support grassroots UK venues and upcoming artists.

        "Content": "\n          Moscow correspondent\n              @IvorBennett\n  Vladimir Putin doesn't do four-day getaways to a single country very often. His last was 20 years ago, to attend the 60th anniversary session of the UN General Assembly in New York in 2005. The fact that his current visit to China is that long says a lot. So does the timing - barely two weeks after the Russian president met Donald Trump in Alaska. Follow the latest: Putin arrives in China to meet 'axis of upheaval'  It feels like a very deliberate illustration of how close Moscow is to Beijing in the face of US attempts to weaken the relationship and its drive to end the war in Ukraine. With China, the American president has tried the stick. Threats of tariffs and secondary sanctions over its continued purchasing of Russian oil. And with Russia, apparently, the carrot too. As well as renewed warnings of \"massive\" sanctions on Moscow, the Reuters news agency last week reported that US and Russian officials also discussed energy deals during recent negotiations, in the hope of incentivising the Kremlin to agree a peace deal, and to start diluting its bond with Beijing. But Putin's programme in China appears designed to emphasise that his relationship with Xi Jinping is stronger than ever. After the two-day Shanghai Cooperation Organisation security summit, the pair will hold face-to-face talks on Tuesday, before Putin takes his place as guest of honour at a military parade on Wednesday that marks the 80th anniversary of Japan's formal surrender in the Second World War. The symbolism is clear - Russia and China fought shoulder-to-shoulder against the enemies of the past, and they'll remain united against the threats of the future. There'll be other powerful photo-ops too, namely with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who is among a string of leaders Vladimir Putin will hold bilateral talks with. A handshake and a smile on the summit sidelines just days after Trump hit India with 50% tariffs for buying Russian oil will be the diplomatic equivalent of blowing a raspberry in Washington's direction. For Russia, the whole visit feels like a pointed show of solidarity amid sanctions - that Moscow and its allies are immune to Western pressure. But amid the symbolism, the Kremlin will be looking for substance here too. Bilateral trade with China, which has helped keep the Russian economy afloat since the invasion of Ukraine, has started to fall in recent months. Read more from Sky News:Russia has made Trump look weakHow Trump and Modi's bromance fell apart After hitting a record high of $245bn in 2024, trade volumes have dipped by 8% since January. And that's particularly worrying for Moscow, with signs the economy could be on the brink of recession. Putin will be hoping to arrest that slump and expand trade into new areas. Most of all, though, I think he'll be seeking a commitment from Russia's economic partners that they won't be going anywhere should the pressure increase."

At least nine people were killed and 25 were injured in Nangarhar province, according to Ajmal Darwaish, spokesman for the regional health department. The quake's epicentre was near Jalalabad, Nangarhar province, at a depth of 14km (8.7 miles). Jalalabad is about 119km (74 miles) away from the capital city, Kabul. There was a second earthquake in the same province about 20 minutes later, with a magnitude of 4.5 and a depth of 10km (6.2 miles). This was later followed by a 5.2 earthquake at the same depth. A magnitude 6.3 earthquake and strong aftershocks struck Afghanistan on 7 October 2023. The country's Taliban government said at least 4,000 people had been killed, but the United Nations said the death toll was around 1,500.

Media reports have suggested that 11 UN workers were detained. The Houthis have controlled much of northwestern Yemen since 2014 after forcing out the internationally recognised government and starting a civil war.

The full membership of the group includes Russia, Belarus, China, India, Iran, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Pakistan, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan. Prime Minister Modi and President Xi also discussed the need to expand trade and investment ties between their two countries, against the backdrop of US tariffs. Mr Modi said India and China pursued strategic autonomy, and their ties should not be seen through the lens of a third country, according to an Indian foreign ministry readout of the meeting. The pair also discussed their shared - and disputed - Himalayan border, which saw a prolonged military standoff after deadly troop clashes in 2020 and undermined bilateral relations. \"We must... not let the border issue define the overall China-India relationship,\" President Xi was reported as saying.

        "Content": " Greta Thunberg has set sail for Gaza as part of the largest flotilla of boats carrying aid for the Strip. The 22-year-old, who was wearing a \"we are all Palestine Action\" T-shirt, was cheered on by thousands of supporters waving Palestinian flags as she and other activists set off from Barcelona's port on Sunday morning. \"This is a mission to challenge the extremely violent, business-as-usual international system that is failing to uphold international law,\" Thunberg told the crowd before the departure of the flotilla of dozens of boats, set to be joined by more aid ships from Greece, Italy and Tunisia. Thunberg already tried to reach Gaza on board a British-flagged yacht in June, but she and other activists were detained by Israeli forces and deported.  Thunberg, who is among hundreds of people from 44 countries on the flotilla, hopes their mission will bring symbolic aid and help open up a humanitarian corridor to deliver more aid. She said on Saturday that the activists' goal is to send \"hope and solidarity to the people of Gaza, showing a clear signal that the world has not forgotten about you\". Israel imposed a blockade on Gaza after Hamas took control of the coastal enclave in 2007 and has blocked numerous attempts to reach Gaza since, including a vessel in 2010 by its special forces, in which at least nine Turkish activists were killed. Israel argues the blockade is necessary to stop weapons from being smuggled to Hamas, and called Thunberg's previous attempt to reach Gaza a propaganda stunt in support of Hamas. On Saturday, Sky News' Europe correspondent Siobhan Robbins asked Thunberg whether she was worried about the dangers of the trip, but the activist said she was instead worried about the \"silence of the world\" in light of what is happening in Gaza. \"I'm terrified to see that we seem to have lost all the humanity that we have, and there seems to be no compassion left in the world amongst the vast majority of people who are able to sit on the couch and watch the genocide unfold that I am terrified for,\" Thunberg added. Israel has repeatedly denied claims of genocide. In a statement to Sky News, the Israel Defence Forces (IDF) said on Saturday: \"The IDF enforces the security naval blockade on the Gaza Strip and is prepared for a wide range of scenarios, which it will act upon in accordance with the directives of the political echelon.\" Read more:Number of dead in Gaza reaches 63,000Thunberg rejects accusations of antisemitism The naval blockade has remained in place through conflicts, including the current war, which began when Hamas fighters attacked southern Israel on 7 October 2023, killing more than 1,200 people and taking 251 hostages. Israel's retaliatory offensive against Hamas has since killed more than 63,000 Palestinians, according to the Hamas-run Gaza health ministry, while part of the Strip is suffering from famine, according to a global hunger monitor - something Israel denies."

        "Content": "\n          India reporter and producer\n              @nevilleskynews\n The blossoming relationship between Donald Trump and Indian prime minister Narendra Modi has abruptly turned sour.  After the heady days of the \"Howdy Modi\" event in Houston, and the mega \"Namaste Trump\" show in Ahmedabad, where a stadium was packed with over 100,000 people to welcome the US president and his family, the humiliation by his \"true friend\" has left the Indian leader seething. For over a decade, Mr Modi has meticulously crafted his image as a global leader rubbing shoulders with, and hugging, world leaders. He now finds himself humiliated by the planet's most powerful man. Ukraine war latest: Putin arrives in China for rare visit  The opposition parties have wasted no time in rubbing salt into that wound, egging Mr Modi to retaliate in the national interest. But so far he has maintained his silence. The indignity began in May after the four-day conflict between Indian and Pakistan. Mr Trump announced on social media that he brokered a ceasefire between two nuclear-armed arch-rivals that was spiralling. This was even before the ceasefire was put in place by the leaders of both countries. Pakistan's Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif instantly thanked the US president for bringing peace to the region and went on to nominate him for the Nobel Peace Prize. Both countries are now exploring crypto and mining deals. \n                  How Moscow and its allies are trying to display their immunity to Western pressure\n                 \n                  China and India discuss disputed border at key summit - as Putin talks about Trump\n                 \n                  China summit has been called 'axis of upheaval' - and that feels right when you look at guest list\n                 Mr Modi has remained silent, his government instead credited its military for forcing Pakistan to concede. Even as Mr Trump has spoken of his intervention publicly over 30 times now. Moreover, he has offered to intervene in the decades-old Kashmir dispute, a taboo subject in India. India is 'Kremlin's laundromat' Then came the swift punishment of an extra 25% tariff levied on India for buying discounted Russian crude oil, taking the total duties to 50%, one of the highest in the world. The US government justified its actions as a national security concern that is fuelling the war in Ukraine and so applied aggressive economic leverage. Mr Trump's trade adviser Peter Navarro described the Russia-Ukraine conflict as \"Modi's war\", and said \"the road to peace runs, at least partly, right through New Delhi\". \"India's Big Oil lobby has turned the largest democracy in the world into a massive refining hub and oil money laundromat for the Kremlin. It's really easy. India can get 25% off tomorrow if it stops buying Russian oil,\" he added. Though China is the largest buyer of Russian oil, it has been left untouched. In 2021, Russian crude accounted for just 3% of India's imports, but this has risen to about 40% in 2024 - making Moscow the country's largest supplier. India says it buys cheap Russian crude for its own energy security and is now pushing for a swadeshi mantra, or self-reliance, reducing the burden of import. Sensing the unpredictability of the US president, the punitive actions and humiliation by his administration, New Delhi is recalibrating. In the run-up to the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) meeting, there have been a flurry of personal meetings between the Indian, Chinese and Russian foreign ministers. Mr Modi's visit to China is his first in seven years and the first since the deadly clashes in May 2020 between soldiers of both militaries in which 20 Indian soldiers lost their lives, resulting in an uproar in the country for retribution. The relations went into deep freeze. The two Asian giants share over 2,000 miles of border, much demarcated and with unresolved land disputes. India-Russia relations There is much history to the special relationship between India and Russia. During the Cold War, India was clubbed in the Soviet Union camp, while America favoured arch rival Pakistan. Both have stood the test of time and supported each other in international forums against western powers on contentious issues. The relationship strengthened particularly in the defence sector. According to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute, Russia supplied 65% of India's weapons purchases during the last two decades. Though India is trying to wean itself off by shopping for military hardware from Western countries, it is a time-consuming process with complicated issues of technology transfers involved. 'Dance of the dragon and elephant' In his bilateral meeting with the Indian leader on Sunday, China's leader Xi Jinping said: \"The two countries must deepen mutual trust, and make opportunities for each other's development rather than threats. \"We should accommodate each other's concerns and uphold peaceful coexistence. Jointly safeguard peace and tranquillity in border areas, ensuring that boundary issues do not define the entirety of China-India. \"Being good neighbours and friends, partners who achieve mutual success, and realising the 'dance of the dragon and the elephant' should be the right choice for both China and India.\" Mr Modi added \"both countries should pursue strategic autonomy, and their relations should not be seen through a third country lens\". The SCO meeting and bilaterals between Mr Modi, President Xi and Russian President Vladmir Putin will be analysed in minute detail, but intense scrutiny will also be on the reaction of the US president."

        "Content": "\n          Asia correspondent\n              @HelenAnnSmith0\n  It's the start of a very big week for China, and there is a clear sense they know the world is watching. Amidst a fractious time for the world order, as wars rage and previously trusted international norms are cast into doubt, China is playing a calculated diplomatic game, and this week is about showing off what it can do. Indeed, at a time when Donald Trump's America feels increasingly unilateral, with traditional allies overlooked or alienated with tariffs, China is showcasing its ability to convene, its ability to lead and its thinly veiled desire to forge a new world order around distinctly anti-American themes. You may well not have heard of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation Summit or the SCO, but it's the first in a series of major events in China this week, convening leaders from some of the world's most significant and some would say 'disruptive' nations. On the face of it it's a security forum, founded initially with just a handful of China's immediate neighbours to discuss border disputes. But it has ballooned into a network of some 26 countries from Asia, Europe and Africa covering a remarkable 43% of the world's population and 23% of its GDP. Some have termed it the \"axis of upheaval\" and that feels about right when you look at the guest list; leaders from Russia, Iran, India, Pakistan, Myanmar, Belarus and Turkey will all be here. And while they are not bound by any sort of mutual defence treaty and there will unlikely be any major pacts or agreements, the optics will no doubt be striking and absolutely designed to rattle those looking on from the West. \n                  How Moscow and its allies are trying to display their immunity to Western pressure\n                 \n                  China and India discuss disputed border at key summit - as Putin talks about Trump\n                 \n                  How Trump's humiliation of Indian PM pushed Modi into arms of Putin and Xi\n                 Of course, a key focus will be the war in Ukraine and Trump's faltering attempts to forge peace. Vladimir Putin will be a guest of honour here and there could hardly be a better forum for him to shore up his support amongst the nations that have kept his country afloat. China has consistently cast itself as neutral on Ukraine but it's been an economic lifeline for Putin's war effort, providing it with components, a ready market for its oil and gas and significant diplomatic cover. While China does have some interest in the war coming to an end - it loathes unpredictability and is already lining up to secure contracts to rebuild Ukraine. But it also won't want to see any outcome that leaves Putin looking weak or Trump looking successful. Indeed, in China's view the war is a good distraction for America. While Trump is caught up with Putin, he has less bandwidth to direct his ire towards them. The presence of India's Narendra Modi is also a remarkable coup for Xi Jinping. Be in no doubt, there is no love lost between the world's two most populous nations. They share a bitter border dispute that turned violent in 2020 and an intense regional rivalry. Also Modi has not been to China for seven years. But this summit comes at a time when the US-India relationship has soured dramatically. For years, the US has worked hard to court India as a vital partner in the region, but now Trump has slapped a total of 50% tariffs on Indian goods, while Modi was reportedly furious at the way he took credit for 'resolving' a flare-up of tensions with Pakistan earlier this summer. China is more than happy to welcome those Trump pushes away. A week of frenzied diplomacy here will climax on Wednesday with an enormous military parade through Beijing's Tiananmen Square to mark 80 years since the surrender of Japan in World War Two. This time Xi will be joined not just by Putin, but by Kim Jong Un of North Korea too, the first time the leader of the hermit kingdom has attended a multilateral event of this size. They will watch tens of thousands of soldiers marching alongside \"fourth generation\" weaponry, some which will be unveiled to the public for the first time. It will be a fitting way to end a week of stark symbolism. Because ultimately, this week is about China burnishing its power. Its firepower yes, but its political power too. The power of its allegiances, the power of its economy, and the power for it to provide alternatives at a time when America is increasingly unpredictable. The only question is to what extent the rest of the world is buying in - from here it feels like many are."

        "Content": "Rudy Giuliani has been taken to hospital after a car crash in New Hampshire, a spokesperson for the former New York City mayor said. Mr Giuliani suffered \"a fractured thoracic vertebrae, multiple lacerations and contusions, as well as injuries to his left arm and lower leg\" when his vehicle was struck from behind while driving on a highway near Manchester, New York, on Saturday evening, according to Michael Ragusa, Mr Giuliani's head of security. \"He sustained injuries but is in good spirits and recovering tremendously,\" Mr Ragusa said in a statement on X, adding: \"This was not a targeted attack.\" Mr Giuliani was in a rental car and \"no one knew it was him\", according to Mr Ragusa.  His head of security said the 81-year-old had been \"flagged down by a woman who was the victim of a domestic violence incident\" and contacted police on her behalf. The crash shortly after was \"random and unrelated\" to the domestic violence incident, Mr Ragusa said. Mr Giuliani, who worked as a lawyer for Donald Trump in his failed efforts to overturn the results of the 2020 election, is expected to be released from hospital in a few days. His son, Andrew Giuliani, thanked people for reaching out after hearing about his father's accident, writing on X: \"Your prayers mean the world.\" \"As a son, I can tell you that I'm honored to have a Dad that I can call the toughest SOB I've ever seen,\" he added. The crash on Saturday follows some tumultuous years for Mr Giuliani, who was once dubbed \"America's mayor\" due to his leadership in New York after the 9/11 attacks in 2001. He was in the running to be the Republican presidential candidate in the 2008 election, but missed out and eventually endorsed John McCain. It was quiet around Mr Giuliani until he emerged as Mr Trump's personal lawyer in 2018, later supporting his allegations of fraud in the 2020 election, which was won by Democrat Joe Biden. But Mr Trump's team lost dozens of lawsuits claiming fraud, and despite numerous recounts, reviews and audits of the 2020 election results, no signs of significant wrongdoing or error were found. Two Georgia election workers successfully sued Mr Giuliani for defamation after he accused them of lying to help the presidential election, and he was ordered to pay them $148m (Â£118m) in damages.

He was later found in contempt of court and faced a trial this winter over the ownership of some of his assets. Mr Giuliani and the two election workers ultimately struck a deal, as part of which he can keep his homes and various high-value belongings, and the women receive unspecified compensation and a promise Mr Giuliani would stop speaking ill of them."

        "Content": " Reform UK has hit back at both the Archbishop of York and the government following criticism of its immigration policies. Speaking on Sky News, Richard Tice, Reform's deputy leader, told Sunday Morning With Trevor Phillips that Stephen Cottrell, who is the acting head of the Church of England, was \"wrong\" with his criticism of his party's deportation policy for illegal migrants. It comes after party leader Nigel Farage announced Reform's flagship immigration plan during a flashy news conference held at an aircraft hangar in Oxford on Tuesday. Politics latest - follow live updates  The party pledged to deport anybody who comes to the UK illegally, regardless of whether they might come to harm, and said it would pay countries with questionable human rights records - such as Afghanistan - to take people back. It also said it would leave numerous international agreements, and revoke the Human Rights Act, in order to do this. \n                  Child 'may have been affected' by pepper spray and officer punched in face as Canary Wharf anti-asylum protest boil over\n                 \n                  Tice's pushback against Church of England criticism wasn't political bareknuckle brawl we often see from Reform\n                 \n                  Sir Keir Starmer promises small boat migrants will be 'detained and sent back'\n                 The policy was criticised by the Conservatives, who said Mr Farage was \"copying our homework\", while parties such as the Liberal Democrats and the Greens condemned it. But the plan came under fire from an altogether different angle on Saturday, when the Archbishop of York accused it of being an \"isolationist, short-term kneejerk\" approach, with no \"long-term solutions\".  Mr Cottrell told the same Sky News programme he had \"every sympathy\" with those who find the issue of immigration tricky. But he said Reform UK's plan did \"nothing to address the issue of what brings people to this country\", and would in fact, make \"the problem worse\". On Sunday, Mr Tice responded to the archbishop's criticisms, saying that \"all of it is wrong\". The MP for Boston and Skegness said he was a Christian who \"enjoys\" the church - but that the \"role of the archbishop is not actually to interfere with international migration policies\". Mr Tice then turned his fire on the government, accusing ministers of being \"more interested in protecting the rights of people who've come here illegally... than looking after the rights of British citizens\". He accused ministers of having \"abandoned\" their duty of \"looking after the interests of British citizens\".  Mr Tice reaffirmed his party's policy that the UK should leave the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR), calling it a \"70-year-old, out-of-date, unfit-for-purpose agreement\". The Reform UK deputy leader also: â€¢ Defended plans to pay the Taliban to take migrants back, comparing it to doing business deals with \"people you don't like\" â€¢ Said the Royal Navy should be deployed in the English Channel as a \"deterrent\", but added: \"We're not saying sink the boats\" â€¢ Urged the government to call an early general election  Meanwhile, Bridget Phillipson, the education secretary, told Sky News that Reform \"want to provoke anger, but they don't actually want to solve the problems that we face in front of us\". She told Sunday Morning With Trevor Phillips the UK had a \"proud tradition [of] supporting those facing persecution\". But she added: \"We will make sure that people who have no right to be in this country are removed from this country. That's right. It's what people expect. It's what this government will deliver.\" Ms Phillipson also insisted there \"needs to be reform of the ECHR\" and said the home secretary is \"looking at the article eight provisions\", which cover the right to a private and family life, to see \"whether they need updating and reforming for the modern age\". ðŸ‘‰ Listen to Sky News Daily on your podcast app ðŸ‘ˆ  However, she refused to say what the government would do if it is found that the ECHR is unreformable. Instead, she defended Labour's position of staying in the governance of the convention, saying that honouring the \"rule of law\" is important. She added: \"Our standing in the world matters if we want to strike trade deals with countries. We need to be a country that's taken seriously. We need to be a country that honours our obligations and honours the rule of law.\"   Ms Phillipson was also drawn on the recent court ruling in favour of the Home Office, which overturned an injunction banning The Bell Hotel in Epping from housing asylum seekers. Challenged on whether the government is prioritising the rights of asylum seekers over British citizens, she said it \"is about a balance of rights\". The cabinet minister also repeated the government's plans to end the use of hotels to house asylum seekers by 2029.  Shadow Cabinet Office minister Alex Burghart said the Conservatives would be willing to leave the ECHR - if this route is recommended to them. The Tories have asked a senior judge to look into the \"legal intricacies\" of leaving the convention, which he said is \"not straightforward\". He said when the party receives that report, it will then make a decision. Challenged on whether the Tories will leave if that is what the report recommends, he added: \"If that's what's necessary, we will do it.\" Mr Burghart also said he believed the previous Conservative government's biggest mistake was that \"we did not go far enough on overruling human rights legislation\", which prevented it from \"taking the tough action that was absolutely necessary\". But he added the Conservatives have now \"put forward very clear legislation that would solve this problem\" - though he concluded Labour \"isn't going to do it\" so the problem \"is going to get worse\"."

The mantra that \"any publicity is good publicity\" seemingly inked into the party playbook. That may be why they seem reasonably relaxed about recent criticism of their migration plans by the Church of England. Speaking on Tuesday, Nigel Farage delicately suggested that in recent years church leaders had been \"out of touch with their own flock\".  That, likely a not-so-subtle reference to the former head of the church Justin Welby - who made frequent interventions into the migration debate. Follow live politics updates: Tice says archbishop's criticism is 'all wrong' Farage's deputy Richard Tice did push back against comments made by the Archbishop of York to Sky News.

It seems Reform isn't the only party turning a blind eye to criticism from the clergy though. This weekend, Sir Keir Starmer appeared to toughen his language on migration again - posting online that \"if you cross the Channel unlawfully, you will be detained and sent back\". The issue for the prime minister is - as it stands - that just isn't true. Recent data shows that for those crossing the Channel, the most likely outcome is that they will be approved for asylum and allowed to stay - following a period where their accommodation will be paid for by the public.  If you want a visual indication of this uncomfortable truth just look at the face of the education secretary as Sky's Trevor Phillips asked if she agreed with the argument of the government's own lawyers in court that the rights of asylum seekers in the Bell Hotel in Epping outweigh local concerns on this occasion. It took a few attempts, but Bridget Phillipson eventually confirmed that she did. Little wonder that some Labour big beasts are increasingly reaching the conclusion that if issues around rights are stopping action then perhaps those rights need looking at. Read more analysis:How Trump's humiliation of Modi pushed him into arms of PutinChina summit dubbed 'axis of upheaval', which feels right The last week saw former foreign secretary Jack Straw join former home secretary David Blunkett in calling for a suspension of the European Convention on Human Rights. Sir Keir Starmer's predecessor as director of public prosecutions Lord Macdonald has also suggested new laws are needed to replace the Refugee Convention - another international agreement often cited in asylum cases. All of this may prove too much for a prime minister who literally wrote the book on European human rights law. Home Office sources are instead arguing that there are tentative signs that their current approach may be working, with August channel crossings lower than they have been in previous years. If that trend continues, ministers may buy themselves some time - and some space from the attacks emanating from Reform. If it doesn't, then the clamber for plan B will become more pronounced."

        "Content": "\n          Arts and entertainment reporter\n              @BethanyMinelle\n Coldplay have rescheduled the final two dates of their 10-show run at Wembley Stadium because of strike action on the London Underground. Rail, Maritime And Transport (RMT) union walkouts next Sunday and Monday make it impossible for fans to get to and from the venue safely, the band said in a statement. The completion of their Wembley run will see Coldplay become the first act to play 10 dates at the national football stadium in the same year, knocking current joint record holders Taylor Swift and Take That from the top spot. Both Swift and Take That have played eight Wembley shows in a single year. Industrial action on the Tube will take place at different times from 5 September for seven days, impacting Coldplay's gigs - which are part of the band's eco-friendly Music Of The Spheres world tour - on 7 and 8 September. A statement from the band posted on social media read: \"We're sorry to announce that, due to planned industrial action on the London Underground, we've been forced to reschedule our final two concerts of the current Wembley Stadium run. \"Without a Tube service, it's impossible to get 82,000 people to the concert and home again safely, and therefore no event licence can be granted for the nights of 7th and 8th September. \n                  Dick Van Dyke says he's 'not afraid' of death - as he approaches 99th birthday\n                 \n                  Coldplay's Chris Martin falls through stage in Australia\n                 \n                  Coldplay singer Chris Martin has 'serious lung infection', band announce as they call off gigs in Brazil\n                 \"To avoid cancelling the shows, our only option is to reschedule.\" Read more on Sky News:Celebrity peer Lord Charles Brocket charged with rapeBoy, 12, dies after falling in park playground They said the show on 7 September would move to 6 September and the show on 8 September would move to 12 September. The band added: \"We're very sorry for the inevitable disappointment, frustration and inconvenience that this situation causes.\" Coldplay said tickets would remain valid for their rescheduled date, but any fans who are unable to attend their rescheduled show can get a full refund on their ticket from their point of purchase before noon on 2 September. Returned tickets are to go on general sale at 11am on 3 September via Ticketmaster. The band confirmed shows on 30 and 31 August, and 3 September and 4 September would go ahead as scheduled. Some 10% of the band's proceeds from the Wembley shows will be donated to the Music Venue Trust to help support grassroots UK venues and upcoming artists. Fronted by Chris Martin, Coldplay formed in 1997, and have gone on to achieve two UK number one singles and 10 UK number one albums. They are best known for songs such as Yellow, Fix You, A Sky Full Of Stars and Viva La Vida."

        "Content": "Tennis player Kamil Majchrzak tracked down a fan whose cap was snatched away from him at the US Open - so he could give him a new one. The Polish star, 29, signed balls and towels for people in the crowds at Flushing Meadows in New York after he won his match against Russia's Karen Khachanov on Thursday. Footage of him giving his cap to a young boy - only for it to be taken from his hands by a man next to him - was circulated widely online. Majchrzak, who was forced to pull out of the tournament due to injury on Saturday, put out a plea to find the fan on his Instagram page. \"After the match I didn't record that my cap didn't get to the boy,\" he wrote. \"Thanks to @asicstennis I've got enough caps, so I'm prepared for that. Hey guys, could you help me find the kid from my match. If it's you (or your parents see this), please send me a DM.\" Shortly afterwards he posted again to say he had traced the boy and subsequently uploaded a video of them meeting at Flushing Meadows.
