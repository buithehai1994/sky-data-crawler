        "Content": "\n          News correspondent\n        On a dark December morning two years ago, Kiki Marriott left her flat and started walking. Content warning: This article contains references to suicide. It was 5am, and she was heading for the station. \"I was numb at that point,\" she says. \"I was just so done with trying to survive and just existing… feeling extremely lonely and isolated and didn't know where to turn.\" She was trapped in a cycle of addiction, gambling all hours and taking cocaine for the maximum buzz. \"I sat at the train station thinking about my daughter, thinking about the mistakes that I've made in the past, thinking that I didn't want to live this life any more.\" Kiki was waiting for the first train. But that train was late. And she changed her mind. Instead of taking her own life, she decided to seek help. Yet what she would find on that journey of recovery would shock her. \"I just realised that there wasn't anybody that looked like me, sounded like me, and it got me to thinking, well I can't be the only black woman suffering with a gambling or cocaine addiction.\"  Racial disparities Research has shown that people from ethnic minority backgrounds are less likely to gamble than white people, but are more likely to suffer harm from gambling. Despite that, too often they do not seek help. And YouGov statistics shared exclusively with Sky News shed a light on why. The survey of 4,000 adults for GamCare, which runs the National Gambling Helpline, found that two-thirds of people from ethnic minority backgrounds who'd gambled in the past year had spent more money than they'd planned, double the amount of white respondents. They were also more than twice as likely to hide their gambling and nearly three times as likely to feel guilt. Kiki is not surprised. \"For me, coming from a black community, a black background, what goes on indoors stays behind closed doors,\" she says. \"You keep your mouth shut, and you handle your business yourself.\" And when she considered what an addict looked like, it wasn't someone like her. \"I just thought it's an old white man's thing - that they go into the bookies, and they have a drink and they bet. \"I thought, well, that's not me.\" But Dharmi Kapadia, a senior sociology lecturer from Manchester University, who focuses on racial inequality, thinks there's more than just cultural pressure at play. \"These explanations of stigma have become dominant,\" she says. \"We've found that what's more important is that people don't want to go and get help from gambling services because of previous racist treatment that they've suffered at the hands of other statutory services, for example, when they went to the GP.\" 'I needed to change' The stigma felt very real for Kiki, so she hid what she was doing. \"I've had trauma in my life. I've been sexually abused as a child. \"As the years have gone on, a traumatic event happened in my family that really changed the dynamics of my life and that's when I moved on from scratch cards to online slots.\" She became hooked - betting around the clock, spending her benefits on 10p and 20p spins on online slots and borrowing money from those around her. Eventually her daughter moved out when she was 15. \"That's when everything escalated. I didn't have that responsibility of keeping up appearances. \"Before that, gas, electric, food shopping, all those things had to be in place. \"I just lived and breathed in my bedroom at that point and yeah, it was very lonely.\" When Kiki left the station that day, she called the National Gambling Helpline. \"For the first time in my life, I was completely honest about everything that I was doing - the lies, the manipulation when I was in active addiction, the secrecy. \"I was completely transparent because I wanted to change. I needed to change.\" 'Where's all the women?' Since then, she has undergone constant therapy, including a six-week stint in rehab. And as she headed home in the taxi, her phone rang. It was Lisa Walker, a woman who understood gambling addiction. She had won £127,000 playing poker at 29 before losing everything and ending up homeless with her young children. When she finally asked for help, she too felt she was different, walking into a Gamblers Anonymous meeting to find she was one of only two women in a room with 35 men. \"I was thinking, where's all the women?\" says Lisa. \"I can't be the only woman in the world with a gambling addiction, so that got me thinking, what services are out there for women?\" It was the catalyst to set up support for female gamblers in April 2022. Since then, Lisa has helped close to 250 women, but all but four have been white. One of those four was Kiki. 'There's no getting away from it' \"It just baffles me… Why aren't they reaching out for support? Is it the shame? Is it stigma?\" says Lisa. But another concern is that it's simply too easy to hide the gambling. \"Getting on the train this morning, 90% of people are on their phones, and we don't know whether they're playing slots,\" she says. \"I could probably sit here now and sign up for 50 online casinos and probably get over a thousand free spins. \"I just think there's no getting away from it because it's 24 hours a day.\" Kiki's flat in Woolwich, where once she couldn't even go to the bathroom without gambling, has become the place where she runs her own online peer mentoring groups. \"Feeling understood and validated for your experiences, for how you was raised… the core beliefs that you're taught from a young age, to have somebody that looks like you, talks like you, has the same cultural background… it's extremely important to make you feel understood, to make you feel validated,\" she says. 'You can learn from it' Kiki will need to attend support groups for life to keep her addictions at bay. But she has a clear goal, just as Lisa did. \"My focus is to help other people, help empower other people to choose themselves, to show them that there is light after so much darkness… that you don't have to be a victim of your circumstances, that you can choose to grow from it and learn from it and heal from it,\" she says. For Kiki, there was so much at stake. \"It was either I was going to die or I was going to become a woman and a mother that my daughter could come back to and respect again.\" And that has happened. Kiki's daughter is 19 now. \"We've got an amazing relationship today. I've took full accountability for the mistakes that I've made. \"She's extremely proud of where I am today.\" It's more than Kiki could have dreamt of two years ago. Now all she wants is to help others escape the endless cycle of addiction.

        "Content": "\n          Communities correspondent\n              @LisaatSky\n  \"The system is more than broken - it crossed that limit a long time ago,\" says Palestinian asylum seeker Ibrahim Altaqatqa. Ibrahim came to the UK two years ago on a tourist visa - then claimed asylum. In the time he's been waiting to have his claim processed, he's met his partner Yvonne, who is English, and five weeks ago their baby daughter Alisha was born. But his asylum claim remains unresolved, and he says he can't return to his home near Hebron in the West Bank because of his political activism. \"I can't just be stuck like this,\" he says. \"I can't just waste day after day of my life waiting for somebody to say 'OK, we give you a decision'.\" He wants to move on with his life and be allowed to work, he says. \"I don't think you need two years to process any asylum claim. I don't think there's any case that's complicated to that level. I'm not single any more. I've got other responsibilities now.\" 'I'd be happy to join hotel protests' Formerly a farmer in the Golan Heights, Ibrahim says he's well aware of the shifting public mood over immigration and shares frustration over the money being spent on asylum seekers. \"I don't think they are putting their anger toward the right group,\" he says. \"On many occasions, I spoke with a lot of them - the people who were protesting by the hotel. \"I said 'if you are really angry and if you really want to save your country, I will be more than happy to come with you and let's go together to protest'.\"  Ibrahim says he stayed in three Home Office-funded asylum hotels and claims at one point he got scabies. He claims the food and conditions were so bad at one point, he left and slept on the streets. Huge backlog of asylum claims Meanwhile, the National Audit Office (NAO), the UK's independent public spending watchdog, has published a study on the processing and costs of people claiming asylum, examining the causes of delays and inefficiencies. It analysed a sample of 5,000 asylum claims lodged almost three years ago and found 35% of them have so far been granted, while 9% of the claimants have been removed from the UK. But the claims of more than half - 56% - remain unresolved. Ruth Kelly, NAO chief analyst, says ministers have tended to take \"short-term reactive interventions to fix problems, but then these have led to other pressures forming elsewhere in the system and new backlogs forming\". \"That's led to wasted funds, poor outcomes for asylum seekers, and harm to the government's ability to meet its obligations to citizens.\" The NAO estimates in the last year the Home Office and Ministry of Justice spent nearly £5bn on asylum - more than £2bn of that on asylum hotels. It says there is a lack of a \"whole system\" approach within the Home Office; no shared objectives and there needs to be more robust shared data. The NAO said it found the Home Office's effectiveness and value for money are being undermined because of fundamental barriers that mean people seeking asylum spend extended periods waiting in the system. Read more on Sky News:Asylum seeker taxi banRise in asylum seekers in hotelsHow immigration system is changing The government has announced a raft of new measures to overhaul the asylum system but the watchdog points out they will take time and parliamentary approval to introduce. In November, the home secretary acknowledged some people who are coming to the UK are economic migrants seeking to abuse the system, with even genuine refugees passing through other safe countries searching for the most attractive place to seek refuge.  Government vows to 'restore order' With asylum claims falling across Europe but rising in the UK, the government says it wants to reduce illegal migrant arrivals and increase the removal of people with no right to be in the UK. A Home Office spokesperson said the home secretary \"recently announced the most sweeping changes to the asylum system in a generation to deal with the problems outlined in this report. \"We are already making progress - with nearly 50,000 people with no right to be here removed, a 63% rise in illegal working arrests and over 21,000 small boat crossing attempts prevented so far this year. \"Our new reforms will restore order and control, remove the incentives which draw people to come to the UK illegally and increase removals of those with no right to be here.\""

The government launches its 10-year youth plan today, which has pledged £500m to reviving youth services. Culture Secretary Lisa Nandy has also warned that young people are now \"the most isolated in generations\" and face challenges that are \"urgent and demand a major change in direction\". But despite the strong language, the Conservatives have warned that \"under Labour, the outlook for the next generation is increasingly bleak\". Lisa Nandy is on Sky News from 7am - follow live Launching the 10-year strategy, Sir Keir said: \"As a dad and as prime minister, I believe it is our generation's greatest responsibility to turn the tide on the lost decade of young kids left as collateral damage. It is our moral mission. \"Today, my government sets out a clear, ambitious and deliverable plan - investing in the next generation so that every child has the chance to see their talents take them as far as their ability can.\" What's in the government's strategy? Under the plans, the government will seek to give 500,000 more young people across England access to a trusted adult outside their homes - who are assigned through a formal programme - and online resources about staying safe. The prime minister said the plans will also \"ensure\" that those who choose to do apprenticeships rather than go to university \"will have the same respect and opportunity as everyone else\". The plan comes following a so-called \"state of the nation\" survey commissioned by Ms Nandy, which heard from more than 14,000 young people across England. Launching the strategy, she said: \"Young people have been crystal clear in speaking up in our consultation: they need support for their mental health, spaces to meet with people in their communities and real opportunities to thrive. We will give them what they want.\" Read more:Child poverty strategy launchedYoung people may lose benefits  But the Conservatives have criticised the government for scrapping the National Citizen Service (NCS), which ended in March this year. Shadow culture secretary Nigel Huddlestone said \"any renewed investment in youth services is of course welcome\", but said Labour's \"economic mismanagement and tax hikes are forcing businesses to close, shrinking opportunities while inflation continues to climb\"."

        "Content": "\n          Europe correspondent\n              @SiobhanRobbins\n  Donald Trump's bruising assessment of Europe as \"weak\" and \"decaying\" is a bitter blow to nations already reeling from the release of his national security strategy. At the end of the 45-minute interview with Politico, EU leaders might be forgiven for thinking, with friends like these, who needs enemies? \"Europe doesn't know what to do,\" Trump said, \"They want to be politically correct, and it makes them weak.\" On the contrary, I would imagine some choice words were being uttered in European capitals as they waded through the string of insults. First up, the US president criticised European leaders for failing to end the war between Russia and Ukraine. \"They talk but they don't produce. And the war just keeps going on and on,\" he said. The fact that the Russians have shown no real commitment to stopping the invasion they started is not mentioned. \n                  Conway on the frontline of Trump's trade war\n                 \n                  Ukraine war: The signs Putin is expecting more conflict, not less - and the frank conversation Keir Starmer needs to have\n                 \n                  Are Trump's allies behind hostile takeover bid of Warner Bros?\n                 Instead, the blame is laid squarely at the feet of Ukraine and its allies in Europe. \"I think if I weren't president, we would have had World War III,\" Trump suggested, while concluding that Moscow is in the stronger position. Critics claim that the White House has emboldened the Kremlin and brought Putin in from the cold with a summit and photo opportunities. Trump highlights the fact that his return to office forced many European NATO members to increase defence spending drastically. On this, he is correct - the growing insecurity around how long America can be relied on has brought security into sharp focus. The release of the new US national security strategy has only added to the feelings of unease. German Chancellor Friedrich Merz on Tuesday claimed some of its contents were unacceptable from a European point of view. \"I see no need for America to want to save democracy in Europe. If it was necessary to save it, we would manage it on our own,\" he told a news conference in Rhineland-Palatinate, the German state where Trump's paternal grandfather was born. The leader of the EU's biggest power also said that the new US strategy was not a surprise and largely chimed with the vice president's speech at the Munich Security Conference in February. For this reason, Merz reiterated that Europe and Germany must become more independent from America for their security policies. However, he noted, \"I say in my discussions with the Americans, 'America first' is fine, but America alone cannot be in your interests.\" For his part, while Trump said he liked most of Europe's current leaders, he warned they were \"destroying\" their countries with their migration policies. He said: \"Europe is a different place, and if it keeps going the way it's going, Europe will not be…in my opinion, many of those countries will not be viable countries any longer. Their immigration policy is a disaster\". He added: \"Most European nations... they're decaying.\" Read more:Analysis: Putin preparing for more war, not lessWhite House: Europe 'unrecognisable in 20 years or less' Again, the comments echoed his security strategy, which warned immigration risked \"civilisation erasure\" in Europe. There's no doubt immigration is a major concern for many of the continent's leaders and voters.  However, irregular crossings into the EU fell 22% in the first 10 months of 2025 according to Frontex, a fact which seems to have passed the president and his team by. \"Within a few decades at the latest, certain Nato members will become majority non-European\", his security document warned. It also suggested \"cultivating resistance\" in Europe \"to restore former greatness\" leading to speculation about how America might intervene in European politics. Trump appeared to add further clarification on Tuesday, saying while he did not \"want to run Europe\", he would consider \"endorsing\" his preferred candidates in future elections. 👉 Tap to follow Trump100 wherever you get your podcasts👈 This comment will also ruffle feathers on the continent where the European Council President has already warned Trump's administration against interfering in Europe's affairs. \"Allies do not threaten to interfere in the domestic political choices of their allies,\" Antonio Costa said on Monday. \"The US cannot replace Europe in what its vision is of free expression… Europe must be sovereign.\" So, what will happen now, and how will Europe's leaders respond? If you are hoping for a showdown, you will likely be disappointed. Like him or loathe him, Europe's leaders need Trump. They need the might of America and want to try to secure continued support for Ukraine. While the next few days will be filled with politely scripted statements or rejections of the president's comments, most of his allies know on this occasion they are probably best to grin and bear it."

        "Content": "\n          Security and Defence Editor\n              @haynesdeborah\n  A \"cheap ceasefire\" between Ukraine and Russia - with Kyiv forced to surrender land - would create an \"expensive peace\" for the whole of Europe, Norway's foreign minister has warned. Espen Barth Eide explained this could mean security challenges for generations, with the continent's whole future \"on the line\". It was why Ukraine, its European allies and the US should seek to agree a common position when trying to secure a settlement with Vladimir Putin, the top Norwegian diplomat told Sky News in an interview during a visit to London on Tuesday. Ukraine war latest: Trump says Putin has upper hand in peace talks \"I very much hope that we will have peace in Ukraine and nobody wants that more than the Ukrainians themselves,\" Mr Eide said. \"But I am worried that we might push this to what in quotation marks is a 'cheap ceasefire', which will lead to a very expensive peace.\" Explaining what he meant, Mr Eide said a post-war era follows every conflict - big or small.  How that plays out typically depends upon the conditions under which the fighting stopped. \"If you are not careful, you will lock in certain things that it will be hard to overcome,\" he said. \"So if we leave with deep uncertainties, or if we allow a kind of a new Yalta, a new Iron Curtain, to descend on Europe as we come to peace in Ukraine, that's problematic for the whole of Europe. So our future is very much on the line here.\" He said this mattered most for Ukrainians - but the outcome of the war will also affect the future of his country, the UK and the rest of the continent. \"This has to be taken more seriously… It's a conflict in Europe, it has global consequences, but it's fundamentally a war in our continent and the way it's solved matters to our coming generations,\" the Norwegian foreign minister said. Russia 'will know very well how to exploit vagueness' Asked what he meant by a cheap ceasefire, he said: \"If Ukraine is forced to give up territory that it currently militarily holds, I think that would be very problematic. \"If restrictions are imposed on future sovereignty. If there's vagueness on what was actually agreed that can be exploited. I think our Russian neighbours will know very well how to exploit that vagueness in order to keep a small flame burning to annoy us in the future.\" Progress being made on peace talks Referring to the latest round of peace talks, initiated by Donald Trump, Mr Eide signalled that progress was being made from an initial 28-point peace plan proposed a couple of weeks ago by the United States that favoured Moscow over Kyiv. That document included a requirement for the Ukrainian side to give up territory it still holds in eastern Ukraine to Russia and Mr Eide described it as \"problematic in many aspects\". But he said: \"I think we've now had a good conversation between Ukraine, leading European countries and the US on how to adapt and develop that into something which might be a good platform for Ukraine and its allies to go to Russia with. \"We still don't know the Russian response, but what I do know is the more we are in agreement as the West, the better Ukraine will stand.\""

As reported by The Guardian, she is the first artist with a learning disability to win the award. Along with Hanging Sculpture 1-10, which European art exhibitors Manifesta commissioned her to create at a disused power station in Barcelona, Ms Kalu won for her presentation in Conversations, a group exhibition at Walker Art Gallery in Liverpool. For the sculpture series, the artist created the vividly-coloured works from repeated lines and wrappings of different materials, making nest or cocoon-like forms. The installation consisted of 10 large brightly-coloured sculptures that hung from grey concrete pillars of the industrial site.

        "Content": " Northwest Scotland is expected to bear the worst of Storm Bram, with an amber warning issued for \"very strong and disruptive winds\". The Met Office is warning of gusts potentially upwards of 90mph in the region. There has been disruption across the UK on Tuesday, with flights and trains cancelled and hundreds of properties left without power. Nine weather warnings for wind were still in place on Tuesday evening, with amber warnings issued for parts of the Scottish Highlands, the Outer Hebrides, Strathclyde, and Northern Ireland. Additional amber rain warnings covering parts of South Wales and southwest England came into force overnight and are due to last until 10am. The forecaster says 50 to 75mm of rain is expected across these affected areas, with a possible peak of 100mm. Delays and cancellations to transport services are likely across the warning areas. \n                  UK weather: 90mph winds possible and travel disruption likely as Storm Bram hits\n                 \n                  Storm Bram: 'Danger to life' warning as strong winds, heavy rain and flooding forecast for parts of UK and Ireland\n                 \n                  UK weather: Danger to life warning for parts of UK as 'month's worth of rain' to fall in 24 hours\n                 The worst of the conditions are expected in Scotland, where an amber warning for wind came into force at 4pm. It has now been extended from midnight on Tuesday until 3am on Wednesday. The rest of the country is covered by yellow wind warnings which extend into Wednesday. The Met Office has warned that flying debris could cause a danger to life. There's also potential for large waves and beach material being thrown onto sea fronts, coastal roads and properties, the forecaster warned. It added that roads, bridges and railway lines could be forced to close, with delays possible to bus, train, ferry services and flights. Power cuts and damage to homes are also possible, with roofs blowing off and power lines being brought down. Commuters flying in and out of Dublin Airport have been seriously affected today, with 91 flights cancelled at the airport, and around a further 10 flights diverted to other airports, due to strong winds. \"Further disruption is possible later today as wind speeds are expected to increase,\" Dublin Airport wrote in a post on X. Passengers have been told to contact their airline directly for a status update on their flights.

In Greater Manchester, there was flooding and a crash involving several vehicles on part of the M66, which was closed southbound while crews cleared the water. Devon was one of the hardest-hit regions in the UK over the past 24 hours, as the Met Office indicated \"the worst of the rain\" has cleared in Wales and southwest England. The agency said there were \"very high rainfall totals\" from 3pm yesterday to 3pm today. Three areas in Devon were among the worst hit, with White Barrow, Devon, topping the list, recording 111.5mm of rainfall. Treherbert in Glamorgan had 83.8mm, just ahead of Dartmoor (81.2mm) and Princetown (79.4mm) in Devon. Train services in some areas will also be suspended later and ferries have been cancelled as the storm sweeps in. The railway line was closed between Par and Newquay in Cornwall due to flooding. Great Western Railway also closed the line between Swindon and Bristol Parkway. Transport for Wales said the line between Abercynon and Aberdare was closed due to severe flooding, while fewer trains were able to run due to flooding on the line between Danescourt and Cardiff Central station. Network Rail Scotland said that some train services will be suspended later in the day as conditions affect transport. The Glenfinnan to Mallaig line will be shut from 4pm on Tuesday, as well as between Dingwall Junction and Kyle of Lochalsh from 5pm. Speed restrictions will also be in place on many other routes in Scotland as the worst of the weather moves in. ScotRail advised passengers to check their journey before travelling. Forecasters warned that gusts of 60-70 mph are expected quite widely, but there will be potential gusts of 70-80 mph across the Hebrides and western Highlands. Another warning will be in place from noon on Tuesday until 6am on Wednesday, covering Central, Tayside and Fife, Grampian, the Highlands and Western Isles, southern Scotland and Strathclyde. There are warnings that gusts around 50-60 mph are possible fairly widely, and potentially in excess of 70 mph in exposed areas and on high ground. A yellow warning of rain was in place from Scotland's central belt to the border until midday. The Met Office has issued yellow warnings of strong wind for northern Scotland lasting until 10pm on Wednesday and for central, eastern and southern Scotland, which are in force until 9pm. Check the forecast where you are \"Storm Bram will bring a very wet and windy spell of weather, with very strong winds and further heavy rain,\" advised chief forecaster Dan Suri. Sky News meteorologist Dr Christopher England warned many areas could face disruption from \"damaging gusts\". \"It only takes one tree falling in the wrong place at the wrong time to have a significant impact,\" he said. Check before you travel Damage to buildings and homes, travel disruption, flooding, and power cuts are all possible. Those covered by the amber alert - mainly in the Highlands and Eilean Siar - should protect their property and people from injury by checking for loose items outside their home and securing them, the Met Office said. Travel disruption is likely, with roads, bridges, and railway lines all vulnerable to closure. Delays and cancellations on buses, trains, ferries, and flights are possible. Transport Scotland and Network Rail have urged people to check before they travel. Storm Bram was named by the Irish weather service Met Eireann."

        "Content": "\n          News correspondent\n        On a dark December morning two years ago, Kiki Marriott left her flat and started walking. Content warning: This article contains references to suicide. It was 5am, and she was heading for the station. \"I was numb at that point,\" she says. \"I was just so done with trying to survive and just existing… feeling extremely lonely and isolated and didn't know where to turn.\" She was trapped in a cycle of addiction, gambling all hours and taking cocaine for the maximum buzz. \"I sat at the train station thinking about my daughter, thinking about the mistakes that I've made in the past, thinking that I didn't want to live this life any more.\" Kiki was waiting for the first train. But that train was late. And she changed her mind. Instead of taking her own life, she decided to seek help. Yet what she would find on that journey of recovery would shock her. \"I just realised that there wasn't anybody that looked like me, sounded like me, and it got me to thinking, well I can't be the only black woman suffering with a gambling or cocaine addiction.\"  Racial disparities Research has shown that people from ethnic minority backgrounds are less likely to gamble than white people, but are more likely to suffer harm from gambling. Despite that, too often they do not seek help. And YouGov statistics shared exclusively with Sky News shed a light on why. The survey of 4,000 adults for GamCare, which runs the National Gambling Helpline, found that two-thirds of people from ethnic minority backgrounds who'd gambled in the past year had spent more money than they'd planned, double the amount of white respondents. They were also more than twice as likely to hide their gambling and nearly three times as likely to feel guilt. Kiki is not surprised. \"For me, coming from a black community, a black background, what goes on indoors stays behind closed doors,\" she says. \"You keep your mouth shut, and you handle your business yourself.\" And when she considered what an addict looked like, it wasn't someone like her. \"I just thought it's an old white man's thing - that they go into the bookies, and they have a drink and they bet. \"I thought, well, that's not me.\" But Dharmi Kapadia, a senior sociology lecturer from Manchester University, who focuses on racial inequality, thinks there's more than just cultural pressure at play. \"These explanations of stigma have become dominant,\" she says. \"We've found that what's more important is that people don't want to go and get help from gambling services because of previous racist treatment that they've suffered at the hands of other statutory services, for example, when they went to the GP.\" 'I needed to change' The stigma felt very real for Kiki, so she hid what she was doing. \"I've had trauma in my life. I've been sexually abused as a child. \"As the years have gone on, a traumatic event happened in my family that really changed the dynamics of my life and that's when I moved on from scratch cards to online slots.\" She became hooked - betting around the clock, spending her benefits on 10p and 20p spins on online slots and borrowing money from those around her. Eventually her daughter moved out when she was 15. \"That's when everything escalated. I didn't have that responsibility of keeping up appearances. \"Before that, gas, electric, food shopping, all those things had to be in place. \"I just lived and breathed in my bedroom at that point and yeah, it was very lonely.\" When Kiki left the station that day, she called the National Gambling Helpline. \"For the first time in my life, I was completely honest about everything that I was doing - the lies, the manipulation when I was in active addiction, the secrecy. \"I was completely transparent because I wanted to change. I needed to change.\" 'Where's all the women?' Since then, she has undergone constant therapy, including a six-week stint in rehab. And as she headed home in the taxi, her phone rang. It was Lisa Walker, a woman who understood gambling addiction. She had won £127,000 playing poker at 29 before losing everything and ending up homeless with her young children. When she finally asked for help, she too felt she was different, walking into a Gamblers Anonymous meeting to find she was one of only two women in a room with 35 men. \"I was thinking, where's all the women?\" says Lisa. \"I can't be the only woman in the world with a gambling addiction, so that got me thinking, what services are out there for women?\" It was the catalyst to set up support for female gamblers in April 2022. Since then, Lisa has helped close to 250 women, but all but four have been white. One of those four was Kiki. 'There's no getting away from it' \"It just baffles me… Why aren't they reaching out for support? Is it the shame? Is it stigma?\" says Lisa. But another concern is that it's simply too easy to hide the gambling. \"Getting on the train this morning, 90% of people are on their phones, and we don't know whether they're playing slots,\" she says. \"I could probably sit here now and sign up for 50 online casinos and probably get over a thousand free spins. \"I just think there's no getting away from it because it's 24 hours a day.\" Kiki's flat in Woolwich, where once she couldn't even go to the bathroom without gambling, has become the place where she runs her own online peer mentoring groups. \"Feeling understood and validated for your experiences, for how you was raised… the core beliefs that you're taught from a young age, to have somebody that looks like you, talks like you, has the same cultural background… it's extremely important to make you feel understood, to make you feel validated,\" she says. 'You can learn from it' Kiki will need to attend support groups for life to keep her addictions at bay. But she has a clear goal, just as Lisa did. \"My focus is to help other people, help empower other people to choose themselves, to show them that there is light after so much darkness… that you don't have to be a victim of your circumstances, that you can choose to grow from it and learn from it and heal from it,\" she says. For Kiki, there was so much at stake. \"It was either I was going to die or I was going to become a woman and a mother that my daughter could come back to and respect again.\" And that has happened. Kiki's daughter is 19 now. \"We've got an amazing relationship today. I've took full accountability for the mistakes that I've made. \"She's extremely proud of where I am today.\" It's more than Kiki could have dreamt of two years ago. Now all she wants is to help others escape the endless cycle of addiction. Anyone feeling emotionally distressed or suicidal can call Samaritans for help on 116 123 or email jo@samaritans.org in the UK.

Ibrahim came to the UK two years ago on a tourist visa - then claimed asylum. In the time he's been waiting to have his claim processed, he's met his partner Yvonne, who is English, and five weeks ago their baby daughter Alisha was born. But his asylum claim remains unresolved, and he says he can't return to his home near Hebron in the West Bank because of his political activism. \"I can't just be stuck like this,\" he says. \"I can't just waste day after day of my life waiting for somebody to say 'OK, we give you a decision'.\" He wants to move on with his life and be allowed to work, he says. \"I don't think you need two years to process any asylum claim. I don't think there's any case that's complicated to that level. I'm not single any more. I've got other responsibilities now.\" 'I'd be happy to join hotel protests' Formerly a farmer in the Golan Heights, Ibrahim says he's well aware of the shifting public mood over immigration and shares frustration over the money being spent on asylum seekers. \"I don't think they are putting their anger toward the right group,\" he says. \"On many occasions, I spoke with a lot of them - the people who were protesting by the hotel. \"I said 'if you are really angry and if you really want to save your country, I will be more than happy to come with you and let's go together to protest'.\"  Ibrahim says he stayed in three Home Office-funded asylum hotels and claims at one point he got scabies. He claims the food and conditions were so bad at one point, he left and slept on the streets. Huge backlog of asylum claims Meanwhile, the National Audit Office (NAO), the UK's independent public spending watchdog, has published a study on the processing and costs of people claiming asylum, examining the causes of delays and inefficiencies. It analysed a sample of 5,000 asylum claims lodged almost three years ago and found 35% of them have so far been granted, while 9% of the claimants have been removed from the UK. But the claims of more than half - 56% - remain unresolved. Ruth Kelly, NAO chief analyst, says ministers have tended to take \"short-term reactive interventions to fix problems, but then these have led to other pressures forming elsewhere in the system and new backlogs forming\". \"That's led to wasted funds, poor outcomes for asylum seekers, and harm to the government's ability to meet its obligations to citizens.\" The NAO estimates in the last year the Home Office and Ministry of Justice spent nearly £5bn on asylum - more than £2bn of that on asylum hotels. It says there is a lack of a \"whole system\" approach within the Home Office; no shared objectives and there needs to be more robust shared data. The NAO said it found the Home Office's effectiveness and value for money are being undermined because of fundamental barriers that mean people seeking asylum spend extended periods waiting in the system. Read more on Sky News:Asylum seeker taxi banRise in asylum seekers in hotelsHow immigration system is changing The government has announced a raft of new measures to overhaul the asylum system but the watchdog points out they will take time and parliamentary approval to introduce. In November, the home secretary acknowledged some people who are coming to the UK are economic migrants seeking to abuse the system, with even genuine refugees passing through other safe countries searching for the most attractive place to seek refuge.  Government vows to 'restore order' With asylum claims falling across Europe but rising in the UK, the government says it wants to reduce illegal migrant arrivals and increase the removal of people with no right to be in the UK. A Home Office spokesperson said the home secretary \"recently announced the most sweeping changes to the asylum system in a generation to deal with the problems outlined in this report. \"We are already making progress - with nearly 50,000 people with no right to be here removed, a 63% rise in illegal working arrests and over 21,000 small boat crossing attempts prevented so far this year. \"Our new reforms will restore order and control, remove the incentives which draw people to come to the UK illegally and increase removals of those with no right to be here.\""

The government launches its 10-year youth plan today, which has pledged £500m to reviving youth services. Culture Secretary Lisa Nandy has also warned that young people are now \"the most isolated in generations\" and face challenges that are \"urgent and demand a major change in direction\". But despite the strong language, the Conservatives have warned that \"under Labour, the outlook for the next generation is increasingly bleak\". Lisa Nandy is on Sky News from 7am - follow live Launching the 10-year strategy, Sir Keir said: \"As a dad and as prime minister, I believe it is our generation's greatest responsibility to turn the tide on the lost decade of young kids left as collateral damage. It is our moral mission. \"Today, my government sets out a clear, ambitious and deliverable plan - investing in the next generation so that every child has the chance to see their talents take them as far as their ability can.\" What's in the government's strategy? Under the plans, the government will seek to give 500,000 more young people across England access to a trusted adult outside their homes - who are assigned through a formal programme - and online resources about staying safe. The prime minister said the plans will also \"ensure\" that those who choose to do apprenticeships rather than go to university \"will have the same respect and opportunity as everyone else\". The plan comes following a so-called \"state of the nation\" survey commissioned by Ms Nandy, which heard from more than 14,000 young people across England. Launching the strategy, she said: \"Young people have been crystal clear in speaking up in our consultation: they need support for their mental health, spaces to meet with people in their communities and real opportunities to thrive. We will give them what they want.\" Read more:Child poverty strategy launchedYoung people may lose benefits  But the Conservatives have criticised the government for scrapping the National Citizen Service (NCS), which ended in March this year. Shadow culture secretary Nigel Huddlestone said \"any renewed investment in youth services is of course welcome\", but said Labour's \"economic mismanagement and tax hikes are forcing businesses to close, shrinking opportunities while inflation continues to climb\"."

        "Content": " Northwest Scotland is expected to bear the worst of Storm Bram, with an amber warning issued for \"very strong and disruptive winds\". The Met Office is warning of gusts potentially upwards of 90mph in the region. There has been disruption across the UK on Tuesday, with flights and trains cancelled and hundreds of properties left without power. Nine weather warnings for wind were still in place on Tuesday evening, with amber warnings issued for parts of the Scottish Highlands, the Outer Hebrides, Strathclyde, and Northern Ireland. Additional amber rain warnings covering parts of South Wales and southwest England came into force overnight and are due to last until 10am. The forecaster says 50 to 75mm of rain is expected across these affected areas, with a possible peak of 100mm. Delays and cancellations to transport services are likely across the warning areas. \n                  UK weather: 90mph winds possible and travel disruption likely as Storm Bram hits\n                 \n                  Storm Bram: 'Danger to life' warning as strong winds, heavy rain and flooding forecast for parts of UK and Ireland\n                 \n                  UK weather: Danger to life warning for parts of UK as 'month's worth of rain' to fall in 24 hours\n                 The worst of the conditions are expected in Scotland, where an amber warning for wind came into force at 4pm. It has now been extended from midnight on Tuesday until 3am on Wednesday. The rest of the country is covered by yellow wind warnings which extend into Wednesday. The Met Office has warned that flying debris could cause a danger to life. There's also potential for large waves and beach material being thrown onto sea fronts, coastal roads and properties, the forecaster warned. It added that roads, bridges and railway lines could be forced to close, with delays possible to bus, train, ferry services and flights. Power cuts and damage to homes are also possible, with roofs blowing off and power lines being brought down. Commuters flying in and out of Dublin Airport have been seriously affected today, with 91 flights cancelled at the airport, and around a further 10 flights diverted to other airports, due to strong winds. \"Further disruption is possible later today as wind speeds are expected to increase,\" Dublin Airport wrote in a post on X. Passengers have been told to contact their airline directly for a status update on their flights.

In Greater Manchester, there was flooding and a crash involving several vehicles on part of the M66, which was closed southbound while crews cleared the water. Devon was one of the hardest-hit regions in the UK over the past 24 hours, as the Met Office indicated \"the worst of the rain\" has cleared in Wales and southwest England. The agency said there were \"very high rainfall totals\" from 3pm yesterday to 3pm today. Three areas in Devon were among the worst hit, with White Barrow, Devon, topping the list, recording 111.5mm of rainfall. Treherbert in Glamorgan had 83.8mm, just ahead of Dartmoor (81.2mm) and Princetown (79.4mm) in Devon. Train services in some areas will also be suspended later and ferries have been cancelled as the storm sweeps in. The railway line was closed between Par and Newquay in Cornwall due to flooding. Great Western Railway also closed the line between Swindon and Bristol Parkway. Transport for Wales said the line between Abercynon and Aberdare was closed due to severe flooding, while fewer trains were able to run due to flooding on the line between Danescourt and Cardiff Central station. Network Rail Scotland said that some train services will be suspended later in the day as conditions affect transport. The Glenfinnan to Mallaig line will be shut from 4pm on Tuesday, as well as between Dingwall Junction and Kyle of Lochalsh from 5pm. Speed restrictions will also be in place on many other routes in Scotland as the worst of the weather moves in. ScotRail advised passengers to check their journey before travelling. Forecasters warned that gusts of 60-70 mph are expected quite widely, but there will be potential gusts of 70-80 mph across the Hebrides and western Highlands. Another warning will be in place from noon on Tuesday until 6am on Wednesday, covering Central, Tayside and Fife, Grampian, the Highlands and Western Isles, southern Scotland and Strathclyde. There are warnings that gusts around 50-60 mph are possible fairly widely, and potentially in excess of 70 mph in exposed areas and on high ground. A yellow warning of rain was in place from Scotland's central belt to the border until midday. The Met Office has issued yellow warnings of strong wind for northern Scotland lasting until 10pm on Wednesday and for central, eastern and southern Scotland, which are in force until 9pm. Check the forecast where you are \"Storm Bram will bring a very wet and windy spell of weather, with very strong winds and further heavy rain,\" advised chief forecaster Dan Suri. Sky News meteorologist Dr Christopher England warned many areas could face disruption from \"damaging gusts\". \"It only takes one tree falling in the wrong place at the wrong time to have a significant impact,\" he said. Check before you travel Damage to buildings and homes, travel disruption, flooding, and power cuts are all possible. Those covered by the amber alert - mainly in the Highlands and Eilean Siar - should protect their property and people from injury by checking for loose items outside their home and securing them, the Met Office said. Travel disruption is likely, with roads, bridges, and railway lines all vulnerable to closure. Delays and cancellations on buses, trains, ferries, and flights are possible. Transport Scotland and Network Rail have urged people to check before they travel. Storm Bram was named by the Irish weather service Met Eireann."

        "Content": "Kemi Badenoch has refused to say that the Conservatives are intending to win next May's local elections, despite being repeatedly pushed on the issue. Asked twice to define success for her party at the elections, the Tory leader merely said that she is \"going to be fighting for every vote\". Speaking to Sky News, she added: \"Success is going to be people seeing the Conservative Party as the only party that is competent and credible enough to do the tough stuff that this country needs.\" Politics latest - follow live The comments come as the Conservatives continue to trail in the polls.  New data released by YouGov this morning has put the Tories in third place behind Reform and Labour, a space they have largely occupied throughout the year. The pollster's weekly voting intention analysis put Ms Badenoch's party on 18%, down one percentage point. Ms Badenoch gave a speech on welfare costs in London on Tuesday, where she attacked the government's plans to tackle child poverty.

We need to create jobs. Otherwise, we're not going to have money for councils.\" She added: \"We've seen new parties like Reform come in. They're making a hash of things at council level.

We're going to put out an offer, and we're going to fight for every vote.\" May will see local council elections, as well as votes for the Senedd in Wales and the Scottish Parliament. They are seen as a crucial moment for the Tory leader - and also for Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer.  Ms Badenoch also refused to score the party's performance out of 10, as the year draws to a close, and she marks a little over 12 months as leader. She told Sky News: \"When I look at the historic defeats which Conservatives suffered last year, things are definitely better.\" Read more:Tory-Reform pact 'not happening'Badenoch dismisses Reeves's 'mansplaining' claim Challenged on the Tories' position in the polls, Ms Badenoch said: \"Of course, we have a mountain to climb. \"We lost more seats [in 2024] than we've ever done in our 200-year history.

        "Content": "\n          Ireland correspondent\n              @SMurphyTV\n  A new report into the activities of the top British spy inside the IRA during The Troubles has said that he \"committed crimes of the worst possible kind”, including torture and murder, and should be publicly named by the UK government.  It's widely accepted that the late republican Freddie Scappaticci was the agent, codenamed \"Stakeknife\". He headed the IRA's so-called \"nutting squad\", a notorious internal security unit tasked with hunting and executing informants, but was himself operating as a mole for British intelligence. The final report of a seven-year investigation named Operation Kenova has found that \"there is a compelling ethical case\" to reveal the agent's identity. Operation Kenova live: 'Stakeknife' spy inside IRA committed 'worst possible' crimes Head of Kenova Sir Iain Livingstone said that \"it is in the public interest that Stakeknife is named\". He urged the government to depart from its \"neither confirm nor deny\" (NCND) policy on the grounds of public interest. It's understood that the government believes Stakeknife cannot be officially named at this time due to some outstanding legal issues. Sky News has approached No 10 Downing Street for comment. Freddie Scappaticci died two years ago denying that he was the agent, but all sides in Northern Ireland accept his denial was false. The report also found a \"significant failure\" by MI5 in its late provision of materials to the investigation. \"The further material revealed MI5 had earlier and greater knowledge of the agent than previously stated,\" the report says. Sir Ian Livingstone added that \"further investigative opportunities were undoubtedly lost\", and that the confidence of the communities in Northern Ireland was undermined. Sky News has approached the security agency for comment. Stakeknife produced a \"vast\" amount of intelligence. 3,517 reports from the agent were discovered, including 377 from one 18-month period. But the report found the intelligence was not shared with those who could have used it to save lives. Read more:Bloody Sunday shootings 'unjustified and gratuitous'Government will 'look at every conceivable way' to stop Gerry Adams payout Ireland correspondent He was the most notorious spy of the Troubles. A vicious spy-catcher who was a traitor himself. Today's final report into the activities of \"Stakeknife\" will continue to gall the victims of the IRA's brutal internal system of \"justice\". We were familiar with many of its findings from last year's interim report. We knew Stakeknife's record in saving lives - the necessary evil school of thought - was greatly exaggerated, and he actually cost more lives than he saved. \n We knew his British security forces handlers failed to use intelligence to save lives, in order to protect their \"golden egg\" from exposure.\n We didn't know their special unit was called \"the rat hole\", or that the agent's betrayal was effectively carried out for financial reward… details that make the whole episode seem even more sordid.\n Relatives of those he helped to murder will be disgusted at revelations that his handlers twice took him on holiday out of Northern Ireland - even flying him on military aircraft - at a time when the police were hunting him for murder. \n Even now, after an exhaustive inquiry into his activities, Operation Kenova finds that MI5 are responsible for \"a significant failure\" in the late discovery of important material - costing the team investigative opportunities.\n Failure upon failure, decade after decade.\n The time for official silence over the spy's identity must be over.\n The dogs on the street in West Belfast know it was Freddie Scappaticci. Kenova wants the prime minister to authorise his official naming. With no prosecutions in the offing, and Scappaticci in his grave, it may at least bring some succour to the victims' families today.\n Their loved ones were deemed traitors at the height of a dirty war. Tortured, shot in the head, and dumped.\n Funerals were low-key, stigma-bound affairs, often taking place early in the morning, with few attendees. Shame hung over these republican families for years.\n The man responsible fled Northern Ireland and died in hiding.\n Today's report contains few shocks, but similarly little comfort for the victims of the nutting squad. Last year, Operation Kenova's interim report found the security forces were frequently aware of imminent abductions and murders but failed to protect those at risk. Today's report found his army handlers even took Stakeknife out of Northern Ireland for two holidays, at a time when he was sought by police for murder and kidnapping. He was flown on military aircraft and given military ID. As a result, preventable deaths occurred with the security forces' knowledge and those responsible were not brought to justice and were instead left free to reoffend. 'Wholly unjustified criminality' The 2024 report also concluded that Stakeknife was involved in \"very serious and wholly unjustifiable criminality\", including murder, and claims his intelligence saved \"countless\" or \"hundreds\" of lives were exaggerated. It found that the number of lives saved by his spying ranged from the high single figures to low double figures. This contradicted claims that Scappaticci had saved hundreds of lives during the years he was active, with a former defence chief describing him as \"the goose that laid the golden eggs\". The interim report found that claim to be \"inherently implausible\" and \"a comparison rooted in fables and fairy tales\". The 2024 report also called on the UK government to apologise to bereaved families, given that many murders were avoidable. 'Each evil act being the epitome of cowardice' There was also a call for an apology from republican leaders for \"the most shameful and evil\" actions of the Provisional IRA (PIRA). \"It was PIRA that committed the brutal acts of torture and murder, each evil act being the epitome of cowardice,\" the report stated. No prosecutions connected with Stakeknife will take place, prosecutors in Northern Ireland have already decided. Families of IRA victims associated with Stakeknife will give their response to the Kenova report in a news conference later today. They want Scappaticci to be officially named, and many are seeking an apology from the British government."

        "Content": "\n          Security and Defence Editor\n              @haynesdeborah\n  A \"cheap ceasefire\" between Ukraine and Russia - with Kyiv forced to surrender land - would create an \"expensive peace\" for the whole of Europe, Norway's foreign minister has warned. Espen Barth Eide explained this could mean security challenges for generations, with the continent's whole future \"on the line\". It was why Ukraine, its European allies and the US should seek to agree a common position when trying to secure a settlement with Vladimir Putin, the top Norwegian diplomat told Sky News in an interview during a visit to London on Tuesday. Ukraine war latest: Trump says Putin has upper hand in peace talks \"I very much hope that we will have peace in Ukraine and nobody wants that more than the Ukrainians themselves,\" Mr Eide said. \"But I am worried that we might push this to what in quotation marks is a 'cheap ceasefire', which will lead to a very expensive peace.\" Explaining what he meant, Mr Eide said a post-war era follows every conflict - big or small.  How that plays out typically depends upon the conditions under which the fighting stopped. \"If you are not careful, you will lock in certain things that it will be hard to overcome,\" he said. \"So if we leave with deep uncertainties, or if we allow a kind of a new Yalta, a new Iron Curtain, to descend on Europe as we come to peace in Ukraine, that's problematic for the whole of Europe. So our future is very much on the line here.\" He said this mattered most for Ukrainians - but the outcome of the war will also affect the future of his country, the UK and the rest of the continent. \"This has to be taken more seriously… It's a conflict in Europe, it has global consequences, but it's fundamentally a war in our continent and the way it's solved matters to our coming generations,\" the Norwegian foreign minister said. Russia 'will know very well how to exploit vagueness' Asked what he meant by a cheap ceasefire, he said: \"If Ukraine is forced to give up territory that it currently militarily holds, I think that would be very problematic. \"If restrictions are imposed on future sovereignty. If there's vagueness on what was actually agreed that can be exploited. I think our Russian neighbours will know very well how to exploit that vagueness in order to keep a small flame burning to annoy us in the future.\" Progress being made on peace talks Referring to the latest round of peace talks, initiated by Donald Trump, Mr Eide signalled that progress was being made from an initial 28-point peace plan proposed a couple of weeks ago by the United States that favoured Moscow over Kyiv. That document included a requirement for the Ukrainian side to give up territory it still holds in eastern Ukraine to Russia and Mr Eide described it as \"problematic in many aspects\". But he said: \"I think we've now had a good conversation between Ukraine, leading European countries and the US on how to adapt and develop that into something which might be a good platform for Ukraine and its allies to go to Russia with. \"We still don't know the Russian response, but what I do know is the more we are in agreement as the West, the better Ukraine will stand.\""

Vilnius airport has been closed because of the balloons, which Lithuania says have been sent by smugglers transporting cigarettes in recent weeks. It also says they constitutes a \"hybrid attack\" by Belarus, which is a close ally of Russia. Lithuania is a NATO member and ally to Ukraine during its fight against Russia's full-scale invasion in 2022. On Tuesday Lithuania's interior minister Vladislav Kondratovic told a government meeting: \"The state of emergency is announced not only due to civil aviation disruptions but also due to interests of national security.\" Mr Kondratovic added that the Lithuanian government had asked parliament to grant the military powers to act with police, border guards and security forces during the state of emergency. Should parliament agree, the army will be given permission to limit access to territory, stop and search vehicles, perform checks on people, their documents and belongings, and to detain those resisting or suspected of crimes. Lithuania's defence minister Robert Kaunas said the military would be permitted to use force for these functions. After Lithuania announced its state of emergency, Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko denied accusations that his country was carrying out hybrid attacks on Lithuania and accused Vilnius of \"politicising\" the problem, adding that the balloons could not harm civil aviation. \"If you want normal relations, sit down at the table and discuss these issues. We are ready to do that,\" he said. This includes sending a drone to drop \"extremist material\", which Lithuania denies.

        "Content": "Punk-rap duo Bob Vylan are suing Irish national broadcaster RTE for defamation, claiming it misrepresented chants led by the band when they played this year's Glastonbury festival. The group, which performed at Dublin's Vicar Street last month, claim they were defamed in a report by RTE News that said the lead singer led antisemitic chants when they played the Somerset festival in June. During their performance, singer Pascal Robinson-Foster, whose stage name is Bobby Vylan, led a chant of \"death, death, to the IDF [Israel Defence Forces]\". It provoked widespread criticism of the artist, including from Glastonbury organiser Emily Eavis, and the BBC, which live streamed their show. Phoenix Law launched legal action on behalf of Robinson-Foster and drummer Wade Laurence George at Ireland's High Court on Monday, according to court records. The firm said: \"The proceedings arise from a broadcast aired by RTE News following Bob Vylan's performance at Glastonbury Festival on 28 June 2025. \"During this broadcast, comments were made alleging that the lead singer of Bob Vylan led antisemitic chants. These allegations are categorically denied by our clients and are entirely untrue.\" \n                  Police release update on Bob Vylan Glastonbury investigation\n                 \n                  Bob Vylan on 'death, death to the IDF' chant: 'I'd do it again tomorrow, twice on Sundays'\n                 \n                  Bob Vylan: BBC partly upholds complaints over Glastonbury set\n                 Phoenix Law said Bob Vylan had made statements expressing support for Palestinian self-determination and criticising military actions by the IDF (Israel Defence Forces). His comments did not target Jewish people or express hatred towards any group, the firm said, suggesting they were \"politically charged but not antisemitic in nature\". Solicitor Darragh Mackin said the pair \"are no stranger to utilising their freedom of expression to speak out against the genocide in Gaza\". Mr Mackin said there was \"a fundamental distinction between speaking critically about the role of the Israeli state forces, and being antisemitic\". \"The former is speech within the confines of political expression, whereas the latter is a form of hatred directed towards Jewish people,\" he added. Read more on Sky News:Who are Bob Vylan? The BBC apologised, including to the Jewish community, and said it regretted not pulling the live stream of the set and promised not to live stream \"high-risk\" acts in future. It partially upheld complaints made over the broadcast, accepting the live stream broke the corporation's editorial guidelines. Ofcom's chief executive, Dame Melanie Dawes, said the BBC needed to \"get a grip quicker\" on handling such controversies and complete its internal reports and investigations sooner. Last month, the Metropolitan Police said detectives would take no further action over similar alleged chants made at a Bob Vylan gig in London in May. The individual was not arrested but an investigation was ongoing, the Met said. Avon and Somerset Police said a man, in his 30s, understood to be Mr Robinson-Foster, had voluntarily attended an interview in relation to the band's Glastonbury performance. Enquiries are ongoing, the force said on Tuesday. The US condemned the act's \"hateful tirade\", revoking their visas, while several festivals cancelled their upcoming appearances. Speaking to Louis Theroux in October, Bobby Vylan said he had no regrets about the chants and would do it again \"tomorrow\". Sky News has contacted RTE for comment."

There are also British troops who have been giving medical training. Dozens of former British troops, as well as foreign fighters from many other countries, have travelled to Ukraine to fight for the Ukrainian armed forces ever since Russia launched its full-scale war almost four years ago. A number of them have been killed in battle. But this is the first time a serving member of the military has died. \"It is with deep regret that we must announce that a member of the UK Armed Forces died in Ukraine this morning, Tuesday 9 December,\" the MoD said in a statement. \"He was injured in a tragic accident whilst observing Ukrainian forces test a new defensive capability, away from the front lines.\" It was not immediately clear whether the accident happened on the same day that he died. The location where it occurred has also not been confirmed. The serviceman's family has been notified. Shines a light on UK military's role The death shines a rare light on the little-discussed work of the UK military inside the country.

Cambodia's senate president Hun Sen said on Tuesday that his country waited 24 hours, to honour the ceasefire and allow for evacuations, before launching counterattacks overnight against Thai forces. Thailand, however, says that Cambodian forces also fired at its troops Sunday and Monday. \"Cambodia wants peace, but Cambodia is forced to fight back to defend its territory,\" Mr Hun Sen, who is widely seen as the de facto leader of the country, said in a Facebook statement.

Tensions have simmered since the neighbouring countries signed the US-brokered ceasefire agreement in October, put forward by President Trump.

But if civilian targets are hit, tensions could very quickly intensify, Sky News' Asia correspondent, Cordelia Lynch, wrote on Monday."

        "Content": "\n          Technology correspondent\n              @rowlsmanthorpe\n  The trouble with the scientific evidence behind the social media ban in Australia is that there is not more of it. This feels wrong on every level. We have all heard the stories - there are so many, you can hardly avoid them. And everyone who's ever used social media knows it can be frustrating, to put it mildly. Sure, it has its benefits. But it often feels empty, addictive or actively undermining. And that's even before you get to its more dangerous side, in particular for children - sexual predators, say, or disturbing and inappropriate content. What's more, there's a worrying trend around the world which common sense tells you can only be explained by social media. Teenage mental health is in decline, especially among young girls. In Australia, one measure of good mental health has fallen by 10%. A measure of bad mental health, self-harm admissions to hospital, has risen by more than 40%. There are similar trends around the world. Globally, depressive symptoms have jumped in adolescents worldwide, going from 24% in 2001-2010 to 37% in 2011-2020. \n                  Victims of maternity failings 'disappointed' with findings of damning report\n                 \n                  More than 800,000 young children seeing social media content 'designed to hook adults', figures show\n                 \n                  Rates of high blood pressure in children doubled since 2000, study finds\n                 Read more:How will the law work and could the UK bring in a similar law?  When did the decline start? Around 2010. What else happened in 2010? Social media went mainstream. The conclusion seems so obvious it's hardly worth investigating. Except that when scientists do investigate it, they cannot find the connection. The relationship between social media use and negative health outcomes is tenuous at best. In 2024, a team of scientists from the University of Cambridge analysed 143 studies searching for a connection between social media use and psychological problems like anxiety and depression. They found one, but the correlation was very weak. Correlation tells you how tightly two things move together. For example, the link between the amount of alcohol a person drinks and their blood-alcohol level is extremely strong, with a correlation around 0.90. Height and weight show a solid relationship, at about 0.75. This large study, which in total included 1,094,890 adolescents, put the link between social media use and mental health symptoms between 0.08 and 0.12. The effect may be real, but compared with classic examples of strong correlations, it is tiny. Time and again, studies confirm this finding. You would think, for instance, that if social media were bad for people, then the arrival of Facebook would cause well-being to plummet. Well, researchers studied this, looking at Facebook adoption in 72 countries from 2008 to 2019. \"We found no evidence suggesting that the global penetration of social media is associated with widespread psychological harm,\" they concluded. Read more:Children seeing social media content 'designed to hook adults'Online grooming crimes double, with victims as young as four There was some impact on younger people, but once again, it was mild, and the picture was mixed. \"What that tells us is it's very hard to make decisions about how to intervene at a population level because the evidence of harm is not really clear cut and the findings aren't clear cut,\" says Victoria Goodyear of the University of Birmingham. This conclusion is far from decisive. Social media might generate oceans of data, but only the tech companies really get to see it, so researchers are working with extremely limited material. One big source of information is diaries made by teenagers chronicling their social media use and symptoms - perhaps if there was a better way of measuring what's really going on, we would get a different picture. Of course, there are researchers who believe passionately that social media is undoubtedly harming children, most notably Jonathan Haidt, author of The Anxious Generation, a book which has become a bible among parents campaigning for smartphone bans. I asked Dr Goodyear what she thought of The Anxious Generation. \"I'm not going to comment on that one,\" she replied. This is a common response among researchers in this area, who privately believe that Dr Haidt has left the evidence behind in his crusade against smartphones and social media. Those who do put their heads above the parapet are often sharply critical. A review of Dr Haidt's book in the scientific journal Nature called him \"a gifted storyteller, but his tale is currently one searching for evidence\". For academics, this is savage. Critics of Dr Haidt say that the problem is the other way round. It's not that social media causes depression; it's that adolescents with depressive symptoms interact differently on social media. Banning social media for this is like cracking a nut with a sledgehammer, as it will remove the benefits without necessarily treating the problem. Instead, they argue, we need to rethink the way children are treated by society more generally, giving them fun and freedom so they are not pushed towards screens. As the Nature review of The Anxious Generation concluded: \"We have a generation in crisis and in desperate need of the best of what science and evidence-based solutions can offer. Unfortunately, our time is being spent telling stories that are unsupported by research.\""

        "Content": "\n          Europe correspondent\n              @SiobhanRobbins\n  Donald Trump's bruising assessment of Europe as \"weak\" and \"decaying\" is a bitter blow to nations already reeling from the release of his national security strategy. At the end of the 45-minute interview with Politico, EU leaders might be forgiven for thinking, with friends like these, who needs enemies? \"Europe doesn't know what to do,\" Trump said, \"They want to be politically correct, and it makes them weak.\" On the contrary, I would imagine some choice words were being uttered in European capitals as they waded through the string of insults. First up, the US president criticised European leaders for failing to end the war between Russia and Ukraine. \"They talk but they don't produce. And the war just keeps going on and on,\" he said. The fact that the Russians have shown no real commitment to stopping the invasion they started is not mentioned. \n                  Conway on the frontline of Trump's trade war\n                 \n                  Ukraine war: The signs Putin is expecting more conflict, not less - and the frank conversation Keir Starmer needs to have\n                 \n                  Are Trump's allies behind hostile takeover bid of Warner Bros?\n                 Instead, the blame is laid squarely at the feet of Ukraine and its allies in Europe. \"I think if I weren't president, we would have had World War III,\" Trump suggested, while concluding that Moscow is in the stronger position. Critics claim that the White House has emboldened the Kremlin and brought Putin in from the cold with a summit and photo opportunities. Trump highlights the fact that his return to office forced many European NATO members to increase defence spending drastically. On this, he is correct - the growing insecurity around how long America can be relied on has brought security into sharp focus. The release of the new US national security strategy has only added to the feelings of unease. German Chancellor Friedrich Merz on Tuesday claimed some of its contents were unacceptable from a European point of view. \"I see no need for America to want to save democracy in Europe. If it was necessary to save it, we would manage it on our own,\" he told a news conference in Rhineland-Palatinate, the German state where Trump's paternal grandfather was born. The leader of the EU's biggest power also said that the new US strategy was not a surprise and largely chimed with the vice president's speech at the Munich Security Conference in February. For this reason, Merz reiterated that Europe and Germany must become more independent from America for their security policies. However, he noted, \"I say in my discussions with the Americans, 'America first' is fine, but America alone cannot be in your interests.\" For his part, while Trump said he liked most of Europe's current leaders, he warned they were \"destroying\" their countries with their migration policies. He said: \"Europe is a different place, and if it keeps going the way it's going, Europe will not be…in my opinion, many of those countries will not be viable countries any longer. Their immigration policy is a disaster\". He added: \"Most European nations... they're decaying.\" Read more:Analysis: Putin preparing for more war, not lessWhite House: Europe 'unrecognisable in 20 years or less' Again, the comments echoed his security strategy, which warned immigration risked \"civilisation erasure\" in Europe. There's no doubt immigration is a major concern for many of the continent's leaders and voters.  However, irregular crossings into the EU fell 22% in the first 10 months of 2025 according to Frontex, a fact which seems to have passed the president and his team by. \"Within a few decades at the latest, certain Nato members will become majority non-European\", his security document warned. It also suggested \"cultivating resistance\" in Europe \"to restore former greatness\" leading to speculation about how America might intervene in European politics. Trump appeared to add further clarification on Tuesday, saying while he did not \"want to run Europe\", he would consider \"endorsing\" his preferred candidates in future elections. 👉 Tap to follow Trump100 wherever you get your podcasts👈 This comment will also ruffle feathers on the continent where the European Council President has already warned Trump's administration against interfering in Europe's affairs. \"Allies do not threaten to interfere in the domestic political choices of their allies,\" Antonio Costa said on Monday. \"The US cannot replace Europe in what its vision is of free expression… Europe must be sovereign.\" So, what will happen now, and how will Europe's leaders respond? If you are hoping for a showdown, you will likely be disappointed. Like him or loathe him, Europe's leaders need Trump. They need the might of America and want to try to secure continued support for Ukraine. While the next few days will be filled with politely scripted statements or rejections of the president's comments, most of his allies know on this occasion they are probably best to grin and bear it."

The 27-year-old was arrested in December 2024 and charged with killing UnitedHealthcare chief executive Brian Thompson in New York City. Mangione's lawyers want to block prosecutors from showing or telling jurors at his eventual trial in Manhattan about statements he allegedly made and items they said police seized from his backpack during his arrest at a McDonald's in Pennsylvania. The objects include a 9mm handgun prosecutors say matches the one used in the killing, a silencer, a magazine with bullets wrapped in underwear and a notebook in which they say Mangione described his intent to \"wack\" a healthcare executive. The defence contends the items should be excluded because police did not get a warrant before searching Mangione's backpack. Prosecutors deny claims Mangione was illegally searched and questioned. They also want to suppress some statements he made to police, such as allegedly giving a false name, because officers asked him questions before telling him he had a right to remain silent. Last week, Mangione watched surveillance videos of the killing of Mr Thompson, 50, as he walked to a New York City hotel for his company's annual investor conference. Mangione has pleaded not guilty to state and federal murder charges. The state charges carry the possibility of life in prison, while federal prosecutors are seeking the death penalty. This week's hearing concerns only the state case, but Mangione's lawyers want to bar evidence from both cases.

        "Content": "A New York judge has ordered the release of material from Ghislaine Maxwell's sex trafficking case. Maxwell, a disgraced British socialite and ex-girlfriend of the convicted paedophile Jeffrey Epstein, is serving a 20-year sentence for sex trafficking. In a ruling filed on Tuesday, New York Southern District Judge Paul A Engelmayer granted the US Department of Justice's request to release grand jury transcripts and other material from the 2021 case publicly. A Florida judge issued a similar order in Epstein's case last week, granting the department's request to release transcripts from an abandoned federal grand jury investigation into him in the 2000s. A request to release records from Epstein's 2019 sex trafficking case is still pending. The news comes as the department has until mid-December to release thousands of documents linked to civil and criminal cases involving Epstein. Read more: Some who knew Epstein may be scared for what more could still come out Donald Trump previously opposed the move, but changed his mind last month after US Congress overwhelmingly voted in favour. After weeks of attacking Democrats and Republicans for calling for the release of the files, the US president eventually signed the Epstein Transparency Act on 20 November. It is unclear when the materials on Maxwell's case will be released, as the judge said that the court would require the US attorney for the Southern District of New York to \"personally certify\" that material is \"rigorously reviewed\" before it is released to ensure survivors' identities are protected.  However, Sky's US partner NBC News reported that Mr Engelmayer said in the ruling that care has been taken to \"put in place a mechanism to protect victims from the inadvertent release of materials within the discovery in this case that would identify them or otherwise invade their privacy\". He added that the grand jury materials in the case \"would not reveal new information of any consequence\". The Associated Press also reported that the judge said the materials \"do not identify any person other than Epstein and Maxwell as having had sexual contact with a minor.\" \"They do not discuss or identify any client of Epstein's or Maxwell's,\" Engelmayer wrote. \"They do not reveal any heretofore unknown means or methods of Epstein's or Maxwell's crimes.\" It comes after Maxwell's lawyers wrote to Mr Engelmayer last week, arguing that the release of grand jury materials from her case would \"foreclose the possibility of a fair\" hearing should she be granted a retrial. Maxwell was jailed in 2022 for sex trafficking after recruiting young girls for Epstein during the 1990s and early 2000s. Epstein died by suicide while awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges in 2019. In October, the US Supreme Court rejected Maxwell's attempts to appeal against her sentence. That means a presidential pardon from Mr Trump is now her best chance at being freed before her projected release date in 2037. Sky's US partner NBC News reported in November that, according to a whistleblower, Maxwell, 63, was planning to ask the US president to commute her sentence. Mr Trump said in August, \"nobody has asked\" him to pardon Maxwell, but said he had \"the right to do it\"."

        "Content": "\n          Business and economics reporter\n              @taaffems\n COVID-19 fraud and error cost the taxpayer nearly £11bn, a government watchdog has found. Pandemic support programmes such as furlough, bounce-back loans and Eat Out to Help Out led to £10.9bn in fraud and error, the COVID-19 Counter-Fraud Commissioner Tom Hayhoe's final report has concluded. The government said the sum is enough to fund daily free school meals for the UK's 2.7 million eligible children for eight years. Money blog: mortgage rates 'will fall below 3.5% this year' in price war Weak accountability, bad quality data and poor contracting were identified as the primary causes of the loss. Of the figure, £1.8bn has been recovered, though \"much\" of the shortfall is now \"beyond recovery\", the report said. There remain areas, however, where investing to recover sums is \"worthwhile\" and should continue, it continued. \n                  Boris Johnson rejects 'muddled' COVID inquiry report and accuses chair of 'breathtaking inconsistency'\n                 \n                  The COVID inquiry highlights a truly damning statistic - but there's another, far greater failure\n                 \n                  COVID-19 report goes a long way to answering inquiry's critics\n                 Fraud risks were increased due to the design of the schemes and the absence of fraud expertise, it read. Government departments generally worked independently and designed schemes from scratch, which led to a \"high degree of novelty\" in the design and introduced greater fraud risk. This was especially the case as cross-government fraud expertise was \"often not brought in\" to advise on risk mitigation.  Procurement of personal protective equipment (PPE) involved measures which \"invited mistrust, opportunism and profiteering\". Lack of government data to target economic support made it \"easy\" for fraudsters to claim under more than one scheme and secure dual funding, the report said. Prevention Measures to protect against fraud are said to be \"inadequate\" in the report. Fraud prevention is \"insufficiently embedded\" in thinking and practice across government, it added. Activity to counter fraud and recover funds has \"varied significantly\" across government departments. This reflects differences in fraud exposure, in relationships to the stakeholders supported, and in the \"commitment, capability and investment\" to counter fraud. \"Some departments\" were slow to step up work to recoup funds. What next? Among the four lessons Mr Hayhoe's report recommends the Treasury has been told it should establish a \"scrutiny panel\" of senior officials across government with external members and chaired by a minister to review implementation of recommendations at six-month intervals for \"at least\" two years. This has been suggested as lessons are \"often not learned and recommendations not implemented \". The work is separate from the COVID-19 inquiry, which was set up to scrutinise the decisions made around the virus and the impact they had on day-to-day life."

The cost of a traditional turkey dinner is £32.46, a few pence cheaper than in 2024 due to lower prices on two items. Money blog: Mortgage rates 'will fall below 3.5% this year' The biggest price drop is in frozen turkeys, costing an average of £13.52, 3.6% less than Christmas 2024, according to consumer insight business Worldpanel by Numerator, which monitors supermarkets' sales and prices. Parsnips were the only other item to become cheaper, now going for 71p, a 0.4% reduction. Last year a classic Christmas dinner - including cranberry sauce, stuffing mix, carrots, parsnips, sparkling wine, cauliflower, brussel sprouts, gravy granules, frozen turkey, Christmas pudding and potatoes - was a slightly more expensive £32.57.  The new data also reveals promotional offers now account for 31.2% of all retail spending, up from 30% last year.

Retail sales figures from industry body the British Retail Consortium (BRC), were also released on Tuesday. They suggest consumers pulled back on spending ahead of the budget on 26 November. Analysts at Pantheon Macroeconomics said the data highlighted the \"chilling effect\" that months of pre-budget tax-hike speculation had on economic activity recently. But it noted that wet weather in November, with the UK seeing 131% of its average rainfall for the month, had also played a role. This time of year is crucial for retail businesses as they tend to make a large percentage of their money in the run-up to Christmas. An Treasury spokesperson said: \"Real wages are up more in the first year of this government than the first decade under the previous government, and living standards are higher than they were in the previous parliament.\"We are delivering economic stability, we are cutting borrowing and debt and getting inflation down. \"This helps interest rates, cut five times since the election, keep falling, giving businesses in every part of Britain the confidence to invest.\""

Sky News understands that Robin AI, which was forced to lay off a big chunk of its workforce during the autumn after a new funding round failed to materialise, is selling its managed services division to Scissero, a UK-based peer.

Sky News understands that Qatar Sports Investments (QSI) has signed a memorandum of understanding to take full control of KAS Eupen, which is currently seventh in the league table. The deal is expected to be publicly announced later on Tuesday. Sources close to the takeover said it marked a further step towards QSI's goal of building a multi-club ownership model which has become increasingly common across the global football industry in recent years. QSI is expected to move swiftly to strengthen Eupen's sporting model and expand its commercial operations as well as sharpening the club's focus on youth development and upgrading infrastructure. One insider said the move would align with QSI's long-term strategy of \"developing sports assets and building connected high-performance ecosystems across its portfolio\".

QSI also owns a significant minority interest in Sporting Club de Braga in Portugal, as well as interests outside football such as Art Basel and Premier Padel. Until the deal with QSI, KAS Eupen was owned by Aspire, another Qatari entity unrelated to the new owner. In a statement issued to Sky News, Nasser al Khelaïfi, chairman of Qatar Sports Investments, said: \"Qatar Sports Investments is proud to become the custodian of KAS Eupen and contribute to the development of football in Belgium. \"With QSI's global expertise and passion for football, our objective is to build a modern, competitive football and business structure - bringing pride to KAS Eupen supporters and building on the Club's great legacy to date.

New data released by YouGov this morning has put the Tories in third place behind Reform and Labour, a space they have largely occupied throughout the year. The pollster's weekly voting intention analysis put Ms Badenoch's party on 18%, down one percentage point. Ms Badenoch gave a speech on welfare costs in London on Tuesday, where she attacked the government's plans to tackle child poverty. Afterwards, she sat down with Sky News political correspondent Sam Coates. \n                  Labour accused of 'scandalous attempt to subvert democracy'\n                 \n                  Tory-Reform pact talks 'not happening at any level', says Richard Tice\n                 \n                  'Not now': Badenoch backs triple lock pension for the moment\n                 Asked about the local elections, she said: \"There are going to be local elections all over the country, and there's a conservative message that I want everyone to hear: Our country's not working properly. \"There are fundamental things that need to change. We need to create jobs. Otherwise, we're not going to have money for councils.\" She added: \"We've seen new parties like Reform come in. They're making a hash of things at council level. We need to make sure that people can see the benefits of voting Conservative.\" When it was pointed out that she had not defined success as winning the local elections, Ms Badenoch said: \"The country is going to decide. We're going to put out an offer, and we're going to fight for every vote.\" May will see local council elections, as well as votes for the Senedd in Wales and the Scottish Parliament. They are seen as a crucial moment for the Tory leader - and also for Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer.  Ms Badenoch also refused to score the party's performance out of 10, as the year draws to a close, and she marks a little over 12 months as leader. She told Sky News: \"When I look at the historic defeats which Conservatives suffered last year, things are definitely better.\" Read more:Tory-Reform pact 'not happening'Badenoch dismisses Reeves's 'mansplaining' claim Challenged on the Tories' position in the polls, Ms Badenoch said: \"Of course, we have a mountain to climb. \"We lost more seats [in 2024] than we've ever done in our 200-year history.

        "Content": "\n          Business and economics reporter\n              @taaffems\n COVID-19 fraud and error cost the taxpayer nearly £11bn, a government watchdog has found. Pandemic support programmes such as furlough, bounce-back loans and Eat Out to Help Out led to £10.9bn in fraud and error, the COVID-19 Counter-Fraud Commissioner Tom Hayhoe's final report has concluded. The government said the sum is enough to fund daily free school meals for the UK's 2.7 million eligible children for eight years. Money blog: mortgage rates 'will fall below 3.5% this year' in price war Weak accountability, bad quality data and poor contracting were identified as the primary causes of the loss. Of the figure, £1.8bn has been recovered, though \"much\" of the shortfall is now \"beyond recovery\", the report said. There remain areas, however, where investing to recover sums is \"worthwhile\" and should continue, it continued. \n                  Boris Johnson rejects 'muddled' COVID inquiry report and accuses chair of 'breathtaking inconsistency'\n                 \n                  The COVID inquiry highlights a truly damning statistic - but there's another, far greater failure\n                 \n                  COVID-19 report goes a long way to answering inquiry's critics\n                 Fraud risks were increased due to the design of the schemes and the absence of fraud expertise, it read. Government departments generally worked independently and designed schemes from scratch, which led to a \"high degree of novelty\" in the design and introduced greater fraud risk. This was especially the case as cross-government fraud expertise was \"often not brought in\" to advise on risk mitigation.  Procurement of personal protective equipment (PPE) involved measures which \"invited mistrust, opportunism and profiteering\". Lack of government data to target economic support made it \"easy\" for fraudsters to claim under more than one scheme and secure dual funding, the report said. Prevention Measures to protect against fraud are said to be \"inadequate\" in the report. Fraud prevention is \"insufficiently embedded\" in thinking and practice across government, it added. Activity to counter fraud and recover funds has \"varied significantly\" across government departments. This reflects differences in fraud exposure, in relationships to the stakeholders supported, and in the \"commitment, capability and investment\" to counter fraud. \"Some departments\" were slow to step up work to recoup funds. What next? Among the four lessons Mr Hayhoe's report recommends the Treasury has been told it should establish a \"scrutiny panel\" of senior officials across government with external members and chaired by a minister to review implementation of recommendations at six-month intervals for \"at least\" two years. This has been suggested as lessons are \"often not learned and recommendations not implemented \". The work is separate from the COVID-19 inquiry, which was set up to scrutinise the decisions made around the virus and the impact they had on day-to-day life."

        "Content": "\n          Security and Defence Editor\n              @haynesdeborah\n  With more than a thousand troops being killed or wounded every day, there's no sign that Donald Trump's push to end Russia's war in Ukraine is reducing the battles on the ground. Quite the opposite. Ukraine's military chief says Vladimir Putin is instead using the US president's focus on peace negotiations as \"cover\" while Russian soldiers attempt to seize more land. That means much greater pressure on the Ukrainian frontline, even as Russian and American, or American and Ukrainian, or Ukrainian and European, leaders shake hands and smile for cameras before retreating behind closed doors in Moscow, Alaska, and London.  Putin's not counting on peace The lack of any indicators that the Kremlin is looking to slow its military machine down also makes the risk of war spreading beyond Ukraine's borders increasingly likely. It takes a huge amount of effort, time, and money to put a country on a war footing as Putin has done, partially mobilising his population, allocating huge portions of government spending to the military and realigning Russia's vast industrial base to produce weapons and ammunition. But when the fighting stops, it requires almost as much focus and energy to switch a society back to a peace time rhythm. Deliberately choosing not to dial defence down once the battles cease means a nation will continue to grow its armed forces and weapons stockpiles - a sure sign that it has no intention of being peaceful and is merely having a pause before going on the attack again. The absence of any preparations by Moscow to slow the tempo of its military operations in Ukraine - where it has more than 710,000 troops deployed along a 780-mile frontline - is perhaps an indicator that Putin is anticipating more not less war.  How could the war end? What happens next in Europe will depend on the content of any peace deal on Ukraine. An all-out Russian defeat is all but impossible to conceive without a significant change of heart by the Trump White House and a massive increase in weapons and support. The next best result for Ukraine would be a settlement that seeks to strike a fair balance between the warring sides and their conflicting objectives. This could be done by pausing the fighting along the current line of contact before substantive peace talks then take place, with Ukraine's sovereignty supported by solid security guarantees from Europe and the US. But such a move would require Europe's NATO allies, led by the UK, France and Germany, genuinely to switch their respective militaries and populations back to a wartime footing, with a credible readiness to go to war should Moscow attempt to test their support of Ukraine.  Will Starmer level with the public? That does not just mean increased spending on defence at a much faster rate - in the UK at least - than is currently planned. It is also about the mindset of a country and its willingness to take some pain. France is already openly saying that parents may have to lose their children in a war with Russia, while Germany is requiring all 18-year-old men to undergo medical checks for possible national service. No such tough but frank conversation is being attempted by Sir Keir Starmer with the British public. The furthest his military chief has gone is to say \"warfighting readiness\" is his top priority. But that is meaningless jargon for most of the public. Being ready for war is about so much more than what the professional armed forces can do. Armies fight battles. Countries fight wars. Read more:UK unveils undersea techNavy chief offers chilling warningDoes Britain's threat to Russia ring hollow?  Worst case scenario? The other alternative when it comes to Ukraine is a scenario that sees a sidelined Europe unable to influence the outcome of the negotiations and Kyiv forced to agree to terms that favour Moscow. This would include the surrender of land in the Donbas that is still under Ukrainian control. Such a deal - even if tolerated by Ukraine, which is unimaginable without serious unrest - would likely only mean a temporary halt in hostilities until Putin or whoever succeeds him decides to try again to take the rest of Ukraine, or maybe even test NATO's borders by moving against the Baltic States. With Trump's new national security strategy making clear the US would only intervene to defend Europe if such a move is in America's interests, it is no longer certain that the guarantees contained in NATO's founding Article 5 principle - that an attack on one member state is an attack on all - can be relied upon. To have a sense of how a war with Russia might play out without the US on NATO's side, Sky News and Tortoise ran a wargame that simulates a Russian attack on the UK. In the scenario, Washington does not come to Britain's defences, which leaves the British side with very few options to respond short of a nuclear strike. 👉Search for The Wargame on your podcast app👈"

That's not currently where we are. \"But you can see countries like Turkey with a customs union seemingly benefiting and seeing growth in their economy, and, again, that's self-evident.\"  Ministers have since dismissed the deputy PM's comments.

And they were really important - with the United States, with India, [and] the European Union itself.\" A spokesperson for the prime minister said last week: \"There's no credible economic vision for Britain not positioning us as an open trading economy. \"We have to be grown up about trade-offs. We have redefined bonds with EU, and stuck to our red lines.\" These \"red lines\" refer to a pledge in the Labour 2024 general election manifesto, which stated: \"There will be no return to the single market, the customs union, or freedom of movement.\" Reacting to the vote, party leader Sir Ed Davey said: \"A customs union with the EU is the single biggest step the government could take to grow our economy, put money back into people's pockets and generate billions for our public services.\" The British public voted to leave the EU by 52%-48% in 2016, and the UK formally exited the bloc in 2020."

        "Content": "\n          Technology correspondent\n              @rowlsmanthorpe\n  The trouble with the scientific evidence behind the social media ban in Australia is that there is not more of it. This feels wrong on every level. We have all heard the stories - there are so many, you can hardly avoid them. And everyone who's ever used social media knows it can be frustrating, to put it mildly. Sure, it has its benefits. But it often feels empty, addictive or actively undermining. And that's even before you get to its more dangerous side, in particular for children - sexual predators, say, or disturbing and inappropriate content. What's more, there's a worrying trend around the world which common sense tells you can only be explained by social media. Teenage mental health is in decline, especially among young girls. In Australia, one measure of good mental health has fallen by 10%. A measure of bad mental health, self-harm admissions to hospital, has risen by more than 40%. There are similar trends around the world. Globally, depressive symptoms have jumped in adolescents worldwide, going from 24% in 2001-2010 to 37% in 2011-2020. \n                  Victims of maternity failings 'disappointed' with findings of damning report\n                 \n                  More than 800,000 young children seeing social media content 'designed to hook adults', figures show\n                 \n                  Rates of high blood pressure in children doubled since 2000, study finds\n                 Read more:How will the law work and could the UK bring in a similar law?  When did the decline start? Around 2010. What else happened in 2010? Social media went mainstream. The conclusion seems so obvious it's hardly worth investigating. Except that when scientists do investigate it, they cannot find the connection. The relationship between social media use and negative health outcomes is tenuous at best. In 2024, a team of scientists from the University of Cambridge analysed 143 studies searching for a connection between social media use and psychological problems like anxiety and depression. They found one, but the correlation was very weak. Correlation tells you how tightly two things move together. For example, the link between the amount of alcohol a person drinks and their blood-alcohol level is extremely strong, with a correlation around 0.90. Height and weight show a solid relationship, at about 0.75. This large study, which in total included 1,094,890 adolescents, put the link between social media use and mental health symptoms between 0.08 and 0.12. The effect may be real, but compared with classic examples of strong correlations, it is tiny. Time and again, studies confirm this finding. You would think, for instance, that if social media were bad for people, then the arrival of Facebook would cause well-being to plummet. Well, researchers studied this, looking at Facebook adoption in 72 countries from 2008 to 2019. \"We found no evidence suggesting that the global penetration of social media is associated with widespread psychological harm,\" they concluded. Read more:Children seeing social media content 'designed to hook adults'Online grooming crimes double, with victims as young as four There was some impact on younger people, but once again, it was mild, and the picture was mixed. \"What that tells us is it's very hard to make decisions about how to intervene at a population level because the evidence of harm is not really clear cut and the findings aren't clear cut,\" says Victoria Goodyear of the University of Birmingham. This conclusion is far from decisive. Social media might generate oceans of data, but only the tech companies really get to see it, so researchers are working with extremely limited material. One big source of information is diaries made by teenagers chronicling their social media use and symptoms - perhaps if there was a better way of measuring what's really going on, we would get a different picture. Of course, there are researchers who believe passionately that social media is undoubtedly harming children, most notably Jonathan Haidt, author of The Anxious Generation, a book which has become a bible among parents campaigning for smartphone bans. I asked Dr Goodyear what she thought of The Anxious Generation. \"I'm not going to comment on that one,\" she replied. This is a common response among researchers in this area, who privately believe that Dr Haidt has left the evidence behind in his crusade against smartphones and social media. Those who do put their heads above the parapet are often sharply critical. A review of Dr Haidt's book in the scientific journal Nature called him \"a gifted storyteller, but his tale is currently one searching for evidence\". For academics, this is savage. Critics of Dr Haidt say that the problem is the other way round. It's not that social media causes depression; it's that adolescents with depressive symptoms interact differently on social media. Banning social media for this is like cracking a nut with a sledgehammer, as it will remove the benefits without necessarily treating the problem. Instead, they argue, we need to rethink the way children are treated by society more generally, giving them fun and freedom so they are not pushed towards screens. As the Nature review of The Anxious Generation concluded: \"We have a generation in crisis and in desperate need of the best of what science and evidence-based solutions can offer. Unfortunately, our time is being spent telling stories that are unsupported by research.\""

        "Content": "Punk-rap duo Bob Vylan are suing Irish national broadcaster RTE for defamation, claiming it misrepresented chants led by the band when they played this year's Glastonbury festival. The group, which performed at Dublin's Vicar Street last month, claim they were defamed in a report by RTE News that said the lead singer led antisemitic chants when they played the Somerset festival in June. During their performance, singer Pascal Robinson-Foster, whose stage name is Bobby Vylan, led a chant of \"death, death, to the IDF [Israel Defence Forces]\". It provoked widespread criticism of the artist, including from Glastonbury organiser Emily Eavis, and the BBC, which live streamed their show. Phoenix Law launched legal action on behalf of Robinson-Foster and drummer Wade Laurence George at Ireland's High Court on Monday, according to court records. The firm said: \"The proceedings arise from a broadcast aired by RTE News following Bob Vylan's performance at Glastonbury Festival on 28 June 2025. \"During this broadcast, comments were made alleging that the lead singer of Bob Vylan led antisemitic chants. These allegations are categorically denied by our clients and are entirely untrue.\" \n                  Police release update on Bob Vylan Glastonbury investigation\n                 \n                  Bob Vylan on 'death, death to the IDF' chant: 'I'd do it again tomorrow, twice on Sundays'\n                 \n                  Bob Vylan: BBC partly upholds complaints over Glastonbury set\n                 Phoenix Law said Bob Vylan had made statements expressing support for Palestinian self-determination and criticising military actions by the IDF (Israel Defence Forces). His comments did not target Jewish people or express hatred towards any group, the firm said, suggesting they were \"politically charged but not antisemitic in nature\". Solicitor Darragh Mackin said the pair \"are no stranger to utilising their freedom of expression to speak out against the genocide in Gaza\". Mr Mackin said there was \"a fundamental distinction between speaking critically about the role of the Israeli state forces, and being antisemitic\". \"The former is speech within the confines of political expression, whereas the latter is a form of hatred directed towards Jewish people,\" he added.

The BBC apologised, including to the Jewish community, and said it regretted not pulling the live stream of the set and promised not to live stream \"high-risk\" acts in future. It partially upheld complaints made over the broadcast, accepting the live stream broke the corporation's editorial guidelines. Ofcom's chief executive, Dame Melanie Dawes, said the BBC needed to \"get a grip quicker\" on handling such controversies and complete its internal reports and investigations sooner. Last month, the Metropolitan Police said detectives would take no further action over similar alleged chants made at a Bob Vylan gig in London in May. The individual was not arrested but an investigation was ongoing, the Met said. Avon and Somerset Police said a man, in his 30s, understood to be Mr Robinson-Foster, had voluntarily attended an interview in relation to the band's Glastonbury performance. Enquiries are ongoing, the force said on Tuesday. The US condemned the act's \"hateful tirade\", revoking their visas, while several festivals cancelled their upcoming appearances. Speaking to Louis Theroux in October, Bobby Vylan said he had no regrets about the chants and would do it again \"tomorrow\". Sky News has contacted RTE for comment."
