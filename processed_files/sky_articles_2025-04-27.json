        "Content": "Donald Trump has said he's \"very disappointed\" with Russia as he continues to push for a peace deal to end the war in Ukraine. On Saturday, the US president met with Volodymyr Zelenskyy at the Vatican for their first face-to-face meeting since their explosive White House summit. The Ukrainian president said the meeting ahead of Pope Francis's funeral could end up being \"historic.\" Hours later, Mr Trump questioned Vladimir Putin's appetite for peace in a Truth Social post.  Speaking before boarding Air Force One on Sunday, Mr Trump again said the meeting went well, and that the Ukrainian leader was \"calmer\". \"I think he understands the picture, I think he wants to make a deal,\" he said, before turning to Mr Putin and Russia. \"I want him to stop shooting, sit down and sign a deal,\" the US president said, adding he was \"very disappointed that they did the bombing of those places (including Kyiv, where nine people were killed in a Russian airstrike on Friday) after discussions\". However, Mr Trump said he thinks Mr Zelenskyy is ready to give up Crimea, which the Ukrainian leader has repeatedly said he would refuse to do. \n                  Day 98: Q&A - Trump wins, royal visits and egg-flation\n                 \n                  Trump faces awkward reckoning 100 days into the job - notwithstanding his dreams of being King of America\n                 \n                  What we learn from remarkable photos of Trump-Zelenskyy meeting\n                 He added that \"we'll see what happens in the next few days\" and said \"don't talk to me about Crimea, talk to Obama and Biden about Crimea\". Russia annexed Crimea in 2014, while Barack Obama was president. Meanwhile, US secretary of state Marco Rubio told Sky's US partner network NBC News that a peace deal to end the war was \"closer in general than they've been any time in the last three years, but it's still not there\". \"If this was an easy war to end, it would have been ended by someone else a long time ago,\" he added on the Meet the Press show.

        "Headline": "A series of troubling allegations are made by staff and patients of the South East Coast Ambulance Service - with national health chiefs saying the claims in Sky News' report are \"extremely concerning\" and must be dealt with.",
        "Content": "\n          News correspondent\n              @rachaelvenables\n  A grandmother who claims she was sexually assaulted by a private paramedic on the way to hospital has told Sky News she has been failed by the ambulance service. Warning: This article contains references to sexual abuse and suicide It comes as a staff survey of the same service - the South East Coast Ambulance Service (SECAmb) - heard damning claims of a culture of discrimination and bullying; with allegations of Nazi flags on team video calls and a \"boy's club\" culture where whistleblowers are punished.â€¯ It's been more than a year since a Sky News investigation first heard of a culture of rampant sexual harassment and abuse in ambulance services. These issues have existed for decades right across the country. But now the GMB union, which represents ambulance workers, is calling on the chief executive of SECAmb, Simon Weldon, to resign. It's after a survey of workers heard high instances of inappropriate behaviour and bullying; with a huge fear of speaking out. \n                  Hospital patient had to wait more than 10 days for a bed - as 'unacceptable' crisis laid bare\n                 \n                  How Japan could shape the future of the NHS\n                 \n                  NHS Fife seeking to block public from watching livestream of Sandie Peggie trans row employment tribunal\n                 It's led the GMB to call for an independent investigation, with one representative branding the ambulance trust \"the worst in the country\". The trust told us it is committed to working with unions for positive change. 'I just lay there, terrified' Juliette, 65, has spent four years trying to get her local ambulance trust to listen. In 2021, she accused a private paramedic working with SECAmb of sexually assaulting her. Hit by a car while cycling through Surrey, she remembers lying on the stretcher in agony, afraid to move in case she was paralysed. Two paramedics carried out assessments for around 90 minutes before driving her to hospital. But as soon as she was alone in the back with just one of them, she claims the male paramedic suddenly told her he wanted to \"check her hips\". \"There was no asking, no consent,\" she says. And instead of touching her hips, she claims he sexually assaulted her. \"With his left hand, he opened my shorts up - and put his right hand into my cycling shorts. \"Between my legs.\" She doesn't want to go into the details, but she says she temporarily froze, powerless and terrified of what he might do. All the while he stared down into her eyes and said nothing. \"I felt so uncomfortable. Shamed, frightened, shocked. I didn't want it to continue.\" She said her brain eventually \"snapped into place\" and she moved her legs. She claims he then removed his hand, and sat behind her head in silence for the rest of the journey. \"I just lay there - terrified,\" she whispers.â€¯ She reported it to the police the following day, but with no CCTV in the ambulance, it was her word against his. With no hope of a successful prosecution, the Met Police dropped the case. Then she turned her attention to the ambulance service, hopeful it would act. We've seen correspondence between Juliette's lawyers and SECAmb, which promised to respond to the formal complaint within 25 days. That was repeatedly delayed for several months. \"It was about seven months after the accident. They still hadn't acknowledged anything to do with the sexual assault,\" she recalls. \"They hadn't answered any questions.\"â€¯ Eventually, they effectively said the assault hadn't happened; claiming that Juliette herself had started to remove her cycling shorts, and that \"consent was given\" for an examination after she complained of a pain in her leg. She unequivocally denies every detail of this account. She says it left her feeling \"insulted, betrayed and humiliated\". Why - she asks - would somebody think she had \"wasted all this time\". \"It's too late for me,\" she adds, but she is making a stand to help others avoid the same trauma. Culture of discrimination, harassment and bullying The GMB represents a large number of the 4,000 SECAmb staff, and recently carried out a survey of their members about their experiences of working life. From the nearly 900 responses, the union claims they identified a culture of discrimination towards women staff members with sexual harassment, bullying, and a general \"boys' club\" culture. Of those surveyed, 25.6% had experienced bullying and 26% had witnessed inappropriate conduct. Racism was witnessed by 16% and sexual harassment by 17.2%. What's more, 80% didn't feel confident the trust would support them if they flagged concerning behaviour. 'He's always been into Nazi stuff' Ambulance worker Amelia (not her real name) told Sky News she finally blew the whistle on inappropriate behaviour a few years ago after she joined a video call with colleagues to discuss staffing levels. One of the managers joined them from home. To Amelia's shock, he appeared on their office screen with a large red, white and black Nazi swastika flag prominently behind him.  On his desk was a framed photo of Adolf Hitler, next to what she says looked like a young woman at graduation. On the bookshelves sat a red swastika armband and what she was later told was a World War Two grenade. She was horrified. \"I kept looking around the room thinking, 'why is no one saying anything?'... When I spoke to people afterwards they said: 'Oh yeahâ€¦ he's always been into Nazi stuff.\" At first, she blew the whistle anonymously, but was told she'd have to name herself and put in a formal grievance for it to be investigated. A report seen by Sky News found the manager's \"inappropriate behaviour\" should have been challenged, but he still works for SECAmb. Amelia claims she was isolated by her colleagues, frozen out of meetings and uninvited to team events, saying \"it killed my career\". An independent report found there wasn't enough evidence to prove that she had been deliberately excluded. At one point the police were involved, then days later, she says, \"I had bags of dog faeces on my doorstep. That went on for a few days, I felt like a prisoner in my own home\". \"Whenever I heard sirens, I got palpitations. I was terrified of who would be in that ambulance.\" 'They become the problem' When people like Amelia speak out \"they become the problem\", says Lib Whitfield, a senior GMB organiser. Lib started working with the trust eight years ago, after an independent report was published, highlighting behaviours similar to those referenced in this article. The culture is now the \"worst it's ever been\", says Lib, and she believes it's the \"worst in the country\". \"I am receiving calls every single day from members who are suicidal,\" she adds. Lib says the union has now written to the health secretary, Wes Streeting, with three demands. \"Firstly, we need a full independent investigation into the culture of SECAmb that results in actions and not just words,\" she says. \"Secondly, we are calling for the resignation of the current chief executive who has overseen this getting worse. \"And thirdly, we are calling for an interim chief executive to be appointed who is external to SECAmb and who can have external reporting to ensure they are not corrupted.\" Read more'I was given a choice of bosses to sleep with': Life as a female paramedicAmbulance services must stamp out sexual harassment and bullying, report says We took these allegations to the ambulance trust, which wanted to point out that the alleged events happened before Mr Weldon took over as chief executive. It also said it had issues with the way the anonymous survey was conducted. A spokesperson said in a statement: \"We continue to work hard to make SECAmb a safe organisation for all of our people and are committed to drive real change. \"The historic cases highlighted were thoroughly investigated, including through independent external reviews, and we firmly believe these cases do not reflect the views of the majority of our people on how it feels to work at SECAmb currently. \"We continue to engage openly with the whole trust about the further improvements we want to make and about the changes needed for the ambulance sector as whole. \"We remain absolutely committed to working with our unions to achieve this, although this will only happen with constructive collaboration on all sides.\" Health Secretary Wes Streeting did not respond to our request for an interview, but in a statement a Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said: \"This is an extremely concerning report and we are looking closely at it. Sexual harassment or abuse within the NHS is completely unacceptable and must be dealt with appropriately.\" Anyone feeling emotionally distressed or suicidal can call Samaritans for help on 116 123 or email jo@samaritans.org in the UK.

        "Content": "\n          Political editor\n              @BethRigby\n This week's set of elections across England will be a series of firsts: it will be the first big ballot box test of Sir Keir Starmer's premiership and Kemi Badenoch's leadership of the Conservative Party. We will have the first by-election of this parliament in Labour-held Runcorn, the inaugural elections for the mayoralty of Hull and East Yorkshire and Lincolnshire, and our first chance to see if Reform's surge in the polls since the general election can translate into seats. In play are over 1,600 council seats, six mayoralties and the Labour-held seat of Runcorn and Helsby after a by-election was triggered by the Labour MP Mike Amesbury punching a constituent on a night out. And there is plenty at stake for the party leaders with all the upside in the hands of Nigel Farage, who has barely any council seats to defend and hundreds in his sights, as he looks to translate his poll leads into proper governing - be it through mayoral wins or council control. Sir Keir is bracing for an early verdict on his leadership, with the Runcorn by-election a test of nerves for a Labour Party that will be loathed to lose a seat in the northwest of England to a surging Reform Party. For the Conservatives, the pressure is obvious and acute. Of the 23 councils up for grabs, 16 are currently controlled by the Conservative Party and when they last fought these seats in 2021, the Conservatives were riding high on the back of a then popular Boris Johnson and COVID vaccine bounce. \n                  Kemi Badenoch does not rule out local coalitions with Reform after Thursday's council elections\n                 \n                  Tories 'are not doing a deal with Reform,' Kemi Badenoch insists\n                 \n                  Could the local elections reshape British politics?\n                 Back then, the party's national equivalent vote share - an estimate of how the country would have voted if everywhere had had a local election - was at 40%, with Labour at 30%, the Lib Dems at 15%, and other parties at 15%. Their support has collapsed since then, with current polling putting the Conservatives on 22% - an 18-point drop in vote share - while Reform, lumped in with 'other parties' in 2021, is now polling an average 25%. So, expect to see the Conservatives lose control of councils and hundreds of seats as it haemorrhages support to Reform in a night that is set to be miserable for Kemi Badenoch and her party. The Conservatives have majorities in 18 of the 23 councils up for grabs, and could even see the Lib Dems overtake them to become the second-biggest party in local government when it comes to council control. That would be a huge symbolic blow. The only glimmer of hope is whether the party can win the Cambridge and Peterborough mayoral race where a former Peterborough MP is looking to take the mayoralty from Labour.  But like the Conservatives, there is little for Labour to cling on to in this set of elections as the party prepares for a lacklustre night at the ballot box, reflecting its steady drop in the polls following the autumn budget. Support for Sir Keir's government dipped below 30% last November and has continued on that trajectory, with Labour currently polling on average around 23%. Labour has been haemorrhaging council seats in council by-elections since the national poll last July, and insiders are briefing that the party looks set to lose control of Doncaster Council, the only one it has control of in this set of elections, and perhaps the mayoralty of the city. Since last July, there have been by-elections in 95 vacant Labour council seats and Labour has lost 43 of them. But the biggest race on the night for Labour will be the Runcorn by-election, where Reform is challenging to take a parliamentary seat that has long been part of Labour's territory. While Reform set out with the aim to destroy the Conservative Party, Labour insiders know how bad the Reform surge is for their own prospects, with the party coming in second to Labour in 89 constituencies in the 2024 General Election. The party is all too aware of the threat of Nigel Farage, as Reform taps into voters' disillusionment. \"People voted for change in 2024,\" explains one Labour insider. \"We came in with the double whammy of public services on their knees and the economy facing big challenges, and we promised change. People will be judging us. There is change - waiting lists for the NHS are falling six months in a row - but do people notice it yet? Arguably not.\" Labour is preparing to intensify attacks against Reform. The party is already using remarks made by Mr Farage around re-examining the NHS's funding model to launch a series of attack ads around the local elections and is likely to step this up ahead of polling day. But the party is right to be worried by the Reform threat and to give you a bit of flavour of that, we ran a focus group of voters in Doncaster on the latest edition of the Electoral Dysfunction podcast to get a sense of the mood in a city about to re-elect its council and mayor. 'The country is stuck in a doom loop' Luke Tryl, director of More in Common, who carried out that focus group in Doncaster for us, told us that the group's disillusionment with politics and the main political parties was a common refrain all around the country. \"You know, people basically keep hitting the change button, right? You know, they did it in Brexit. They did in 2017 when [Jeremy] Corbyn does very well, Boris Johnson in 2019 was a sort of change and in 2024, change was literally the slogan of Keir Starmer's 2024 campaign. \"And they keep hitting that change and thinking they're not getting the change. And so actually it pervades right across the political spectrum. It's not limited to just the Tories, Labour, Reform. It's just this sense that something isn't happening and the system isn't responding to what we want,\" Mr Tryl says.  The undertone of the focus group reflected this sentiment, as respondents honed in on very common top-three concerns across the country - cost of living, the NHS, immigration - but also the sense of mistrust in politicians of all hues. \"It's not just that people think that the UK is in a bad state, you know, cost of living is bad, the NHS is bad, struggles with immigration, crime,\" Mr Tryl said. \"It's that they don't have faith in our political class to find solutions. I said recently, I think the UK public moves in a bit of a doom loop at the moment and we can't seem to find a way out of it and how that changes.\" This is helping Mr Farage's Reform as voters, turned off by the Tories and disappointed in Labour, look to hit the change button again. \"Britain is broken and needs Reform\" is Mr Farage's pitch. That's not to say that he was universally liked in our Doncaster focus group. \"It wasn't actually massively effusive about Farage personally, and we're starting to pick that up in a few more focus groups,\" noted Mr Tryl. \"It's rather more like, 'I like what Reform is saying' - people tend to particularly like what they say on immigration - but I've got a few questions about Farage and a word I've heard in other groups is baggage. He's got a lot of baggage.\" He added: \"What you're hearing there is people are slightly willing to put that... we tried the Tories for 14 years. We're not that happy with what we've had from Labour so far. So we may as well roll the dice on this guy. And I think that's what you're going to see next week is that rolling the dice.\"  The Conservatives fared particularly badly with the Doncaster focus group, with just two out of the nine respondents even being able to name their leader Kemi Badenoch. \"If you've got no public image whatsoever, and also no trust, then you're not going to pull any votes,\" was the brutal verdict of one respondent as Mr Johnson was brought up as a politician they thought of as more likeable, relatable and capable of taking on Reform. As for Labour, only one of the respondents seemed prepared to give the government more time to turn around the country and deliver on election promises, with others voicing criticism over the government's handling of the winter fuel allowance cuts, high immigration levels and the lack of progress more broadly. Voters were also hostile to Sir Keir, who they believed to be out of touch, privileged and posh. The best Sir Keir can hope for next week is, in the words of Mr Tryl is to \"tread water\" as we watch to see whether Reform can translate polling gains into real governing. A YouGov poll on Friday suggested Reform is in pole position to win the Lincolnshire mayoralty, while the party is ahead in the Hull and East Yorkshire battle, according to the polling. Labour is also nervous about Reform in the Doncaster mayoral race. ðŸ‘‰ Click here to listen to Electoral Dysfunction on your podcast app ðŸ‘ˆ Expectations for Reform are high, with some pollsters predicting the party could make hundreds of gains in traditionally Conservative counties and have a chance of perhaps even gaining control of Labour-held Doncaster council or Durham, where Labour is the largest party. Reform now has over 100 councillors, most of whom have defected from other parties, and is not defending any seats from 2021, so the only way for Mr Farage is up. Mr Tryl expects the Tories to lose 500 to 600 seats and Reform to pick up the same sort of numbers if it manages to organise its support and turn out the vote. Read more:Labour and Reform in battle for Runcorn by-election seatKemi Badenoch does not rule out local coalitions with Reform  So this will be a moment to test whether the Reform momentum in the polls translates into real progress on the ground and sees it become a major electoral force capable of challenging the two main parties across the country. In the general election, the party clocked up votes, but didn't manage to concentrate that support into concrete wins. Can Reform change that in 2025? This set of local elections is far smaller than normal when it comes to the number of councils being contested than normal (Labour's restructuring of local government has left a number of elections postponed), while the 11 million eligible to vote in England are just a quarter of those who could cast a vote across the UK in last year's general election. But these polls are seriously consequential. This will be a moment when we are able to better observe if the two-party system, battered in the 2024 General Election, really is dying. Last July, third parties secured more votes than ever and a record tally of seats as support for the two establishment parties hit a record low. These elections could be the moment that Reform tastes real power and the Liberal Democrats surge. Voters keep saying they want real change. On 1 May, we'll get a better sense of how serious they are in a set of elections that could point to a profoundly different future for British politics."

        "Content": "\n          Europe correspondent\n              @adamparsons\n  Anna and Irene have already been queuing for an hour or so, and they know they have a long wait still to come.  \"Two hours, three hours, ten hours - what does it matter?\" says Irena. \"This is about eternity.\" They have come to Rome from Slovenia, Catholics who felt \"Papa Francis would have wanted us to be here\". And under the sun outside Santa Maria Maggiore, they are awaiting the opportunity to visit his tomb. Francis, says Irena, \"was like a rainbow\" who lit up the world. Anna nods along: \"We are so happy to be here.\" The Pope's tomb has become a new source of pilgrimage. More than 30,000 people came to view it during the first morning after the Pope's funeral, the queue snaking from the front of the mighty basilica and then up and down across the square at the back. \n                  Pictures of Pope Francis's tomb released as it opens to the public in Rome basilica\n                 \n                  What Sky News correspondents witnessed at the Pope's funeral\n                 \n                  The Pope's funeral: In pictures\n                 Some were curious visitors, others were devout followers - priests and nuns mixing in the queue with tourists and devoted locals. All of these admired Francis; a very few actually knew him. Father Alessandro Masseroni is a deacon who came to Rome to train to become a priest. On his phone, he shows me a photo of him and Francis, with the Pope offering words of encouragement. He says: \"I had the honour to serve Pope Francis and to talk to him many times and it was a special experience. I understand why he was so loved by all the people - he was simple and direct. \"He was sunny. St Francis was his role model and when I saw the first picture of the Pope's tomb, the first thing I thought was of the tomb of St Francis of Assisi. \"Pope Francis will leave a legacy - it doesn't end with his death but will continue.\"  What are your emotions now, as you wait to visit his tomb, I ask. Father Alessandro pauses and smiles. \"Many emotions of course, but mainly, I thinkâ€¦ thankfulness.\" That has been a recurring aspect among so many of the people we have met in Rome over the past week - the sense that sadness for Francis's death is outweighed by the sense that his was a life that should be celebrated. Volodymyr Borysyak flew in from London on the morning of the Pope's funeral to make his third pilgrimage to Rome. Barely had he arrived than his phone was stolen, a crime he responded to by praying for the thief.

Now, the Pope who inspired him has died. You might imagine that he would be resentful and angry. Instead, he is full of smiles.  \"We are happy to be the pilgrims of the world and this is a special day,\" he tells me. \"I know the pope used to pray in this basilica so that is why we will stay so long here to visit Santa Maria Maggiore. \"I think Pope Francis was, is and will be the pope for the world, because of the mercy of his heart and his love for everybody.\""

Arne Slot's men did it in impressive style, turning over Spurs in a convincing win on Sunday afternoon. Liverpool crowned champions; follow latest It was a rocky start for the Reds after Dominic Solanke put the north London side ahead. However, fortunes quickly changed in the first half as Liverpool scored three times without a response. Read more from Sky NewsAnalysis: It wasn't supposed to be Liverpool's yearFormer Liverpool captain diesFIFA issues World Cup ticket scam warning In the second half, it took until the 63rd minute for Mohamed Salah to make it 4-1 before a fifth followed. The Reds have won the title in manager Arne Slot's first season in charge, and move level with fierce rivals Manchester United on 20 League championships. But it makes them arguably the most successful English club ever as they have won more European Cup or Champions League titles. Liverpool captain Virgil van Dijk told Sky Sports after the final whistle: \"It's special and it's something that we don't take for granted. It's amazing. \"A lot of emotions before the game, during the whole week, but we got the job done and we [are] truly deserved champions of England. [Liverpool is] the most beautiful club in the world and I think we deserve all of this. Let's enjoy the next couple of weeks and let it sink in.\" Slot wins title in debut season Slot took over as manager last summer from Jurgen Klopp, who guided them to their previous and maiden Premier League title triumph in 2020, when the COVID-19 lockdown saw matches played behind closed doors. He is the first Dutch manager to win the Premier League and the fifth man to do so in a debut campaign after Jose Mourinho, Carlo Ancelotti, Manuel Pellegrini, and Antonio Conte. Speaking to Sky Sports after the game he said his side \"did an outstanding job\". Asked about Spurs' early lead, he added: \"It wasn't ideal but it didn't take me a long time to trust these players, they always come back, they always find a way to win.\" On how he made winning the title \"so easy\", he said: \"That's not only my job, it's the job of the players and the staff members standing over there and the work Jurgen [Klopp] and Pepijn [Lijnders] left behind over here. \"The culture of the team, the work rate, the quality was outstanding. We all knew that.\" Several players, including Alisson Becker, Trent Alexander-Arnold, Virgil van Dijk, and Mohamed Salah, played leading roles in both the 2025 and 2020 campaigns. Van Dijk and Salah recently signed new contracts extending their careers at the club. Speaking to Sky Sports News after the game, Salah said: \"To win the Premier League with the fans is something special. You saw it in every game. \"This is way better [than five years ago]. 100%. We have a different group now, a different manager so we're able to show we can do it again and it's special.\" Liverpool will have to wait until the final game of the season - at home to Crystal Palace on 25 May - to be presented with the Premier League trophy. It will be the first time the club's fans will have seen their side lift the top-flight title in person since 1990."

        "Content": "\n          Sports correspondent\n              @RobHarris\n This was not meant to be Liverpool's year. But, this time, fans really can celebrate the Premier League.Â  After all the anguish, the 30 years without a title, it has taken only five years to win it again without pandemic restrictions to curb the partying. What looked like a transition season after Jurgen Klopp walked away instead ends in triumph for Arne Slot. The Dutchman has snatched from ailing Manchester United the one record it still proudly boasted - being England's most successful team. Now, Liverpool are level on 20 league titles. Factor in the six European Cups to United's three and the Reds from Merseyside can now claim to be the most successful team in English men's football history. Read moreLiverpool defender signs new contractFour players sent off after brawlSalah in 'last six months' at Anfield United know all about the troubles of replacing a managerial colossus as they endure a 12th season since Sir Alex Ferguson's retirement without lifting the Premier League trophy. It was Sir Alex who famously knocked Liverpool off the perch. The Scot's opening seasons saw Liverpool stretch their supremacy to 18 titles by 1990 before United kicked off a run of 13 triumphs in 1993 unanswered by the great rivals. What makes Slot's instant glory so remarkable is that he lacked the Anfield experience that Joe Fagan and Kenny Dalglish benefited from before taking the helm in the 1980s and ending their first seasons with league championship crowns. Just consider who left Anfield without landing the Premier League since then - from Gerard Houllier to Rafa Benitez. And when Slot arrived from Feyenoord, Klopp's successor said: \"They are big shoes to fill but you can look at it as inheriting a squad and a team which has a winning culture.\" What an inheritance he had, key components of the 2019-20 team. Goalkeeper Alisson Becker has nine clean sheets this season. Captain Virgil van Dijk has been formidable in defence. And Mohamed Salah has been as prolific with 27 goals and 18 assists. The heavy metal football that was Klopp's brand has been replaced by a calmness from a successor who is more restrained on the touchline and pragmatic. The claims they've had it easy? Liverpool have been on top since November - pulling further away from any challengers. \"We don't win games the easy way,\" Slot said. \"The easy way is taking control of the ball, pass it around five times and we have a goal and the next goal and the next goal. \"If we achieve something this year, it's mainly to do with the mentality the players have shown.\" They had the comfort of a growing lead as Arsenal faded away in second. There's been a collapse by Manchester City - so dominant in winning the last four titles before the decline no pundit predicted. Pep Guardiola's side is instead in an unusual position, just trying to qualify for the Champions League with a top-five finish. United have been nowhere - languishing in the bottom half of the table. The Old Trafford chant of \"20 times\". Now the Kop can sing that too. And this time the Kop will be filled when the Premier League trophy is handed over, five years on from a fan-less Anfield staging socially-distanced celebrations. And then a new mission will begin - to claim the record outright by winning title number 21."

        "Content": "\n          News correspondent\n              @rachaelvenables\n  A grandmother who claims she was sexually assaulted by a private paramedic on the way to hospital has told Sky News she has been failed by the ambulance service. Warning: This article contains references to sexual abuse and suicide It comes as a staff survey of the same service - the South East Coast Ambulance Service (SECAmb) - heard damning claims of a culture of discrimination and bullying; with allegations of Nazi flags on team video calls and a \"boy's club\" culture where whistleblowers are punished.â€¯ It's been more than a year since a Sky News investigation first heard of a culture of rampant sexual harassment and abuse in ambulance services. These issues have existed for decades right across the country. But now the GMB union, which represents ambulance workers, is calling on the chief executive of SECAmb, Simon Weldon, to resign. It's after a survey of workers heard high instances of inappropriate behaviour and bullying; with a huge fear of speaking out. \n                  Hospital patient had to wait more than 10 days for a bed - as 'unacceptable' crisis laid bare\n                 \n                  How Japan could shape the future of the NHS\n                 \n                  NHS Fife seeking to block public from watching livestream of Sandie Peggie trans row employment tribunal\n                 It's led the GMB to call for an independent investigation, with one representative branding the ambulance trust \"the worst in the country\". The trust told us it is committed to working with unions for positive change. 'I just lay there, terrified' Juliette, 65, has spent four years trying to get her local ambulance trust to listen. In 2021, she accused a private paramedic working with SECAmb of sexually assaulting her. Hit by a car while cycling through Surrey, she remembers lying on the stretcher in agony, afraid to move in case she was paralysed. Two paramedics carried out assessments for around 90 minutes before driving her to hospital. But as soon as she was alone in the back with just one of them, she claims the male paramedic suddenly told her he wanted to \"check her hips\". \"There was no asking, no consent,\" she says. And instead of touching her hips, she claims he sexually assaulted her. \"With his left hand, he opened my shorts up - and put his right hand into my cycling shorts. \"Between my legs.\" She doesn't want to go into the details, but she says she temporarily froze, powerless and terrified of what he might do. All the while he stared down into her eyes and said nothing. \"I felt so uncomfortable. Shamed, frightened, shocked. I didn't want it to continue.\" She said her brain eventually \"snapped into place\" and she moved her legs. She claims he then removed his hand, and sat behind her head in silence for the rest of the journey. \"I just lay there - terrified,\" she whispers.â€¯ She reported it to the police the following day, but with no CCTV in the ambulance, it was her word against his. With no hope of a successful prosecution, the Met Police dropped the case. Then she turned her attention to the ambulance service, hopeful it would act. We've seen correspondence between Juliette's lawyers and SECAmb, which promised to respond to the formal complaint within 25 days. That was repeatedly delayed for several months. \"It was about seven months after the accident. They still hadn't acknowledged anything to do with the sexual assault,\" she recalls. \"They hadn't answered any questions.\"â€¯ Eventually, they effectively said the assault hadn't happened; claiming that Juliette herself had started to remove her cycling shorts, and that \"consent was given\" for an examination after she complained of a pain in her leg. She unequivocally denies every detail of this account. She says it left her feeling \"insulted, betrayed and humiliated\". Why - she asks - would somebody think she had \"wasted all this time\". \"It's too late for me,\" she adds, but she is making a stand to help others avoid the same trauma. Culture of discrimination, harassment and bullying The GMB represents a large number of the 4,000 SECAmb staff, and recently carried out a survey of their members about their experiences of working life. From the nearly 900 responses, the union claims they identified a culture of discrimination towards women staff members with sexual harassment, bullying, and a general \"boys' club\" culture. Of those surveyed, 25.6% had experienced bullying and 26% had witnessed inappropriate conduct. Racism was witnessed by 16% and sexual harassment by 17.2%. What's more, 80% didn't feel confident the trust would support them if they flagged concerning behaviour. 'He's always been into Nazi stuff' Ambulance worker Amelia (not her real name) told Sky News she finally blew the whistle on inappropriate behaviour a few years ago after she joined a video call with colleagues to discuss staffing levels. One of the managers joined them from home. To Amelia's shock, he appeared on their office screen with a large red, white and black Nazi swastika flag prominently behind him.  On his desk was a framed photo of Adolf Hitler, next to what she says looked like a young woman at graduation. On the bookshelves sat a red swastika armband and what she was later told was a World War Two grenade. She was horrified. \"I kept looking around the room thinking, 'why is no one saying anything?'... When I spoke to people afterwards they said: 'Oh yeahâ€¦ he's always been into Nazi stuff.\" At first, she blew the whistle anonymously, but was told she'd have to name herself and put in a formal grievance for it to be investigated. A report seen by Sky News found the manager's \"inappropriate behaviour\" should have been challenged, but he still works for SECAmb. Amelia claims she was isolated by her colleagues, frozen out of meetings and uninvited to team events, saying \"it killed my career\". An independent report found there wasn't enough evidence to prove that she had been deliberately excluded. At one point the police were involved, then days later, she says, \"I had bags of dog faeces on my doorstep. That went on for a few days, I felt like a prisoner in my own home\". \"Whenever I heard sirens, I got palpitations. I was terrified of who would be in that ambulance.\" 'They become the problem' When people like Amelia speak out \"they become the problem\", says Lib Whitfield, a senior GMB organiser. Lib started working with the trust eight years ago, after an independent report was published, highlighting behaviours similar to those referenced in this article. The culture is now the \"worst it's ever been\", says Lib, and she believes it's the \"worst in the country\". \"I am receiving calls every single day from members who are suicidal,\" she adds. Lib says the union has now written to the health secretary, Wes Streeting, with three demands. \"Firstly, we need a full independent investigation into the culture of SECAmb that results in actions and not just words,\" she says. \"Secondly, we are calling for the resignation of the current chief executive who has overseen this getting worse. \"And thirdly, we are calling for an interim chief executive to be appointed who is external to SECAmb and who can have external reporting to ensure they are not corrupted.\" Read more'I was given a choice of bosses to sleep with': Life as a female paramedicAmbulance services must stamp out sexual harassment and bullying, report says We took these allegations to the ambulance trust, which wanted to point out that the alleged events happened before Mr Weldon took over as chief executive. It also said it had issues with the way the anonymous survey was conducted. A spokesperson said in a statement: \"We continue to work hard to make SECAmb a safe organisation for all of our people and are committed to drive real change. \"The historic cases highlighted were thoroughly investigated, including through independent external reviews, and we firmly believe these cases do not reflect the views of the majority of our people on how it feels to work at SECAmb currently. \"We continue to engage openly with the whole trust about the further improvements we want to make and about the changes needed for the ambulance sector as whole. \"We remain absolutely committed to working with our unions to achieve this, although this will only happen with constructive collaboration on all sides.\" Health Secretary Wes Streeting did not respond to our request for an interview, but in a statement a Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said: \"This is an extremely concerning report and we are looking closely at it. Sexual harassment or abuse within the NHS is completely unacceptable and must be dealt with appropriately.\" Anyone feeling emotionally distressed or suicidal can call Samaritans for help on 116 123 or email jo@samaritans.org in the UK. In the US, call the Samaritans branch in your area or 1 (800) 273-TALK."

Ben Houchen, the Tees Valley Mayor, suggests \"coming together\" could work - Robert Jenrick's similar comments in a leaked recording are now well documented. For others, the idea is toxic - one senior Conservatives messages to say a pact would be \"electoral suicide\". Nigel Farage says he has no intention in coalition at any level. His former communications chief Gawain Towler tells me it's \"interesting and notable that the only people talking about pacts and deals are the Tories\". Deals at a local level are not unusual, the bigger question is whether there will be movement at a national level. Who really needs who? Reform UK only have five seats in parliament, but they now often poll ahead of the Tories. A merger of equals seems unlikely. In any pact, someone must come out on top, and it's hard to see Nigel Farage agreeing to serve under Kemi Badenoch. Both sides will argue they have different approaches and policy points, and Reform are chasing Labour too, but as a general election gets closer could principles gives way to practicalities? For now, the fight for the right goes on as Reform and the Conservatives try to work out how not to hand Keir Starmer a second term. Despite not ruling out agreements between the Tories and Reform once the local elections have finished, Ms Badenoch has been at pains to stress she is against any kind of deal with Mr Farage at a national level. On Friday she criticised talk of \"stitch-ups\" ahead of next week's local elections and said she was instead focused on ensuring that voters have a \"credible Conservative offer\". Speculation that the Tories and Reform could join forces heightened after two senior Tories appeared to advocate for some sort of agreement between the two rival parties. Robert Jenrick, the shadow justice secretary, was captured in a video recording leaked to Sky News vowing to  \"bring this coalition together\" to ensure that Conservatives and Reform UK are no longer competing for votes by the time of the next general election.  According to the excusive audio Mr Jenrick - who lost the Tory leadership campaign to Ms Badenoch - said he would try \"one way or another\" to make sure the two right-wing parties do not end up handing a second term to Sir Keir Starmer. Mr Jenrick has denied his words amounted to calling for a pact with Reform. Meanwhile, in an interview with Politico, Tees Valley Mayor Ben Houchen also suggested the two parties should join forces in some way. \"I don't know what it looks like. I don't know whether it's a pact. I don't know whether it's a mergerâ€¦ [or] a pact of trust and confidence or whatever,\" he said. \"But if we want to make sure that there is a sensible centre-right party leading this country, then there is going to have to be a coming together of Reform and the Conservative Party in some way.\" Read more:Could the local elections reshape British politics?'Bring on the fight' over net zero, says Ed Miliband All of the other national parties have launched their campaigns for the local elections ahead of the poll next week. Labour Cabinet Office minister Pat McFadden told Trevor Phillips that he was \"not predicting huge Labour gains on Thursday\". He also ruled out Labour striking deals with any other party. \"The deals on offer after Thursday won't be between Labour and the Tories and Labour and Reform,\" he said. \"But what there's been a lot of debate about is what's going to happen between the Tories and Reform, because I'm not even sure if they're two different parties or one party at the moment.\""

        "Content": "\n          Political editor\n              @BethRigby\n This week's set of elections across England will be a series of firsts: it will be the first big ballot box test of Sir Keir Starmer's premiership and Kemi Badenoch's leadership of the Conservative Party. We will have the first by-election of this parliament in Labour-held Runcorn, the inaugural elections for the mayoralty of Hull and East Yorkshire and Lincolnshire, and our first chance to see if Reform's surge in the polls since the general election can translate into seats. In play are over 1,600 council seats, six mayoralties and the Labour-held seat of Runcorn and Helsby after a by-election was triggered by the Labour MP Mike Amesbury punching a constituent on a night out. And there is plenty at stake for the party leaders with all the upside in the hands of Nigel Farage, who has barely any council seats to defend and hundreds in his sights, as he looks to translate his poll leads into proper governing - be it through mayoral wins or council control. Sir Keir is bracing for an early verdict on his leadership, with the Runcorn by-election a test of nerves for a Labour Party that will be loathed to lose a seat in the northwest of England to a surging Reform Party. For the Conservatives, the pressure is obvious and acute. Of the 23 councils up for grabs, 16 are currently controlled by the Conservative Party and when they last fought these seats in 2021, the Conservatives were riding high on the back of a then popular Boris Johnson and COVID vaccine bounce. \n                  Kemi Badenoch does not rule out local coalitions with Reform after Thursday's council elections\n                 \n                  Tories 'are not doing a deal with Reform,' Kemi Badenoch insists\n                 \n                  Could the local elections reshape British politics?\n                 Back then, the party's national equivalent vote share - an estimate of how the country would have voted if everywhere had had a local election - was at 40%, with Labour at 30%, the Lib Dems at 15%, and other parties at 15%. Their support has collapsed since then, with current polling putting the Conservatives on 22% - an 18-point drop in vote share - while Reform, lumped in with 'other parties' in 2021, is now polling an average 25%. So, expect to see the Conservatives lose control of councils and hundreds of seats as it haemorrhages support to Reform in a night that is set to be miserable for Kemi Badenoch and her party. The Conservatives have majorities in 18 of the 23 councils up for grabs, and could even see the Lib Dems overtake them to become the second-biggest party in local government when it comes to council control. That would be a huge symbolic blow. The only glimmer of hope is whether the party can win the Cambridge and Peterborough mayoral race where a former Peterborough MP is looking to take the mayoralty from Labour.  But like the Conservatives, there is little for Labour to cling on to in this set of elections as the party prepares for a lacklustre night at the ballot box, reflecting its steady drop in the polls following the autumn budget. Support for Sir Keir's government dipped below 30% last November and has continued on that trajectory, with Labour currently polling on average around 23%. Labour has been haemorrhaging council seats in council by-elections since the national poll last July, and insiders are briefing that the party looks set to lose control of Doncaster Council, the only one it has control of in this set of elections, and perhaps the mayoralty of the city. Since last July, there have been by-elections in 95 vacant Labour council seats and Labour has lost 43 of them. But the biggest race on the night for Labour will be the Runcorn by-election, where Reform is challenging to take a parliamentary seat that has long been part of Labour's territory. While Reform set out with the aim to destroy the Conservative Party, Labour insiders know how bad the Reform surge is for their own prospects, with the party coming in second to Labour in 89 constituencies in the 2024 General Election. The party is all too aware of the threat of Nigel Farage, as Reform taps into voters' disillusionment. \"People voted for change in 2024,\" explains one Labour insider. \"We came in with the double whammy of public services on their knees and the economy facing big challenges, and we promised change. People will be judging us. There is change - waiting lists for the NHS are falling six months in a row - but do people notice it yet? Arguably not.\" Labour is preparing to intensify attacks against Reform. The party is already using remarks made by Mr Farage around re-examining the NHS's funding model to launch a series of attack ads around the local elections and is likely to step this up ahead of polling day. But the party is right to be worried by the Reform threat and to give you a bit of flavour of that, we ran a focus group of voters in Doncaster on the latest edition of the Electoral Dysfunction podcast to get a sense of the mood in a city about to re-elect its council and mayor. 'The country is stuck in a doom loop' Luke Tryl, director of More in Common, who carried out that focus group in Doncaster for us, told us that the group's disillusionment with politics and the main political parties was a common refrain all around the country. \"You know, people basically keep hitting the change button, right? You know, they did it in Brexit. They did in 2017 when [Jeremy] Corbyn does very well, Boris Johnson in 2019 was a sort of change and in 2024, change was literally the slogan of Keir Starmer's 2024 campaign. \"And they keep hitting that change and thinking they're not getting the change. And so actually it pervades right across the political spectrum. It's not limited to just the Tories, Labour, Reform. It's just this sense that something isn't happening and the system isn't responding to what we want,\" Mr Tryl says.  The undertone of the focus group reflected this sentiment, as respondents honed in on very common top-three concerns across the country - cost of living, the NHS, immigration - but also the sense of mistrust in politicians of all hues. \"It's not just that people think that the UK is in a bad state, you know, cost of living is bad, the NHS is bad, struggles with immigration, crime,\" Mr Tryl said. \"It's that they don't have faith in our political class to find solutions. I said recently, I think the UK public moves in a bit of a doom loop at the moment and we can't seem to find a way out of it and how that changes.\" This is helping Mr Farage's Reform as voters, turned off by the Tories and disappointed in Labour, look to hit the change button again. \"Britain is broken and needs Reform\" is Mr Farage's pitch. That's not to say that he was universally liked in our Doncaster focus group. \"It wasn't actually massively effusive about Farage personally, and we're starting to pick that up in a few more focus groups,\" noted Mr Tryl. \"It's rather more like, 'I like what Reform is saying' - people tend to particularly like what they say on immigration - but I've got a few questions about Farage and a word I've heard in other groups is baggage. He's got a lot of baggage.\" He added: \"What you're hearing there is people are slightly willing to put that... we tried the Tories for 14 years. We're not that happy with what we've had from Labour so far. So we may as well roll the dice on this guy. And I think that's what you're going to see next week is that rolling the dice.\"  The Conservatives fared particularly badly with the Doncaster focus group, with just two out of the nine respondents even being able to name their leader Kemi Badenoch. \"If you've got no public image whatsoever, and also no trust, then you're not going to pull any votes,\" was the brutal verdict of one respondent as Mr Johnson was brought up as a politician they thought of as more likeable, relatable and capable of taking on Reform. As for Labour, only one of the respondents seemed prepared to give the government more time to turn around the country and deliver on election promises, with others voicing criticism over the government's handling of the winter fuel allowance cuts, high immigration levels and the lack of progress more broadly. Voters were also hostile to Sir Keir, who they believed to be out of touch, privileged and posh. The best Sir Keir can hope for next week is, in the words of Mr Tryl is to \"tread water\" as we watch to see whether Reform can translate polling gains into real governing. A YouGov poll on Friday suggested Reform is in pole position to win the Lincolnshire mayoralty, while the party is ahead in the Hull and East Yorkshire battle, according to the polling. Labour is also nervous about Reform in the Doncaster mayoral race. ðŸ‘‰ Click here to listen to Electoral Dysfunction on your podcast app ðŸ‘ˆ Expectations for Reform are high, with some pollsters predicting the party could make hundreds of gains in traditionally Conservative counties and have a chance of perhaps even gaining control of Labour-held Doncaster council or Durham, where Labour is the largest party. Reform now has over 100 councillors, most of whom have defected from other parties, and is not defending any seats from 2021, so the only way for Mr Farage is up. Mr Tryl expects the Tories to lose 500 to 600 seats and Reform to pick up the same sort of numbers if it manages to organise its support and turn out the vote. Read more:Labour and Reform in battle for Runcorn by-election seatKemi Badenoch does not rule out local coalitions with Reform  So this will be a moment to test whether the Reform momentum in the polls translates into real progress on the ground and sees it become a major electoral force capable of challenging the two main parties across the country. In the general election, the party clocked up votes, but didn't manage to concentrate that support into concrete wins. Can Reform change that in 2025? This set of local elections is far smaller than normal when it comes to the number of councils being contested than normal (Labour's restructuring of local government has left a number of elections postponed), while the 11 million eligible to vote in England are just a quarter of those who could cast a vote across the UK in last year's general election. But these polls are seriously consequential. This will be a moment when we are able to better observe if the two-party system, battered in the 2024 General Election, really is dying. Last July, third parties secured more votes than ever and a record tally of seats as support for the two establishment parties hit a record low. These elections could be the moment that Reform tastes real power and the Liberal Democrats surge. Voters keep saying they want real change. On 1 May, we'll get a better sense of how serious they are in a set of elections that could point to a profoundly different future for British politics."

        "Content": " A trade deal with the US is \"possible\" but not \"certain\", a senior minister has said as he struck a cautious tone about negotiations with the White House. Pat McFadden, the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, told Sunday Morning with Trevor Phillips there was \"a serious level of engagement going on at high levels\" to secure a UK-US trade deal. However, Mr McFadden, a key ally of Sir Keir Starmer, struck a more cautious tone than Chancellor Rachel Reeves on the prospect of a US trade deal, saying: \"I think an agreement is possible - I don't think it's certain, and I don't want to say it's certain, but I think it's possible.\" He went on to say the government wanted an \"agreement in the UK's interests\" and not a \"hasty deal\", amid fears from critics that Number 10 could acquiesce a deal that lowers food standards, for example, or changes certain taxes in a bid to persuade Donald Trump to lower some of the tariffs that have been placed on British goods. Politics latest: UK has 'recognised all along' that Russia is aggressor - minister And asked about the timing of the deal - following recent reports an agreement was imminent - Mr McFadden said: \"We'll keep working with the United States and keep trying to get to an agreement in the coming weeks.\" As well as talks with the US, the UK has also ramped up its efforts with the EU, with suggestions it could include a new EU youth mobility scheme that would allow under-30s from the bloc to live, work and study in the UK and vice versa. Mr McFadden said he believed the government could \"improve upon\" the Brexit deal struck by Boris Johnson, saying it had caused \"an awful lot of bureaucracy and costs here in the UK\". He said \"first and foremost\" on the government's agenda was securing a food and agriculture and a veterinary agreement, saying it was \"such an important area for the UK and an area where we've had so much extra cost and bureaucracy because of Brexit\". He added: \"But again, as with the United States, there's no point in calling the game before it's done. We've still got work to do, and we're doing that work with our partners in the EU.\" The Cabinet Office minister also rejected suggestions the UK would have to choose between pursuing a trade deal with the US and one with the EU - the latter of which has banned chlorinated chicken in its markets - as has the UK - but which the US has historically wanted. Read more:Chancellor Rachel Reeves outlines red lines for US trade dealGreen Party co-leader denies split over trans rights On the issue of chlorinated chicken, Mr McFadden said the government had \"made clear we will not water down animal welfare standards with either party\". \"But I don't agree that it's some fundamental choice beyond where we have to pick one trading partner rather than another. I think that's to misunderstand the nature of the UK economy, and I don't think would be in our interests to put all our eggs in one basket.\" Also speaking to Trevor Phillips was Tory leader Kemi Badenoch, who said the government should be close to closing the deal with the US \"because we got very close last time President Trump was in office\". She also insisted food standards should not be watered down in order to get a deal, saying she did not reach an agreement with Canada when she was in government for that reason. \"What Labour needs to do now is show that they can get a deal that isn't making concessions, so we can have what we had last month before the trade tariffs, and we need serious people doing this,\" she said."

        "Content": " The use of men's and women's toilets at work and in places like shops and hospitals should be based on biological sex - but trans people will also need facilities, the equalities watchdog has said. It comes after a landmark judgment earlier this month on how a woman should be defined in law. The UK Supreme Court declared on 16 April that the words \"woman\" and \"sex\" in the Equality Act 2010 refer to a biological woman and biological sex. The appeal case was brought against the Scottish government by campaign group For Women Scotland (FWS) following unsuccessful challenges at the Court of Session in Edinburgh. The Supreme Court judgment has been interpreted to mean that trans women, who are biologically male but identify as women, can be excluded from women-only spaces like toilets and changing rooms. But the ruling has caused consternation among some politicians and thousands of people protested in central London on 19 April against what they said was a \"betrayal\" of the trans community. Interim guidance has now been issued by the Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) because \"many people have questions about the judgment and what it means for them\". The watchdog is working on a more detailed code of practice, which it said it is aiming to provide to the government for ministerial approval by June.  No plans for 'toilet police' Meanwhile, Cabinet Office minister Pat McFadden has suggested ministers have no plans for \"toilet police\" in the wake of the Supreme Court ruling. But he also acknowledged the government will have to change its practices following the judgment. The EHRC has said trans women \"should not be permitted to use the women's facilities\" in workplaces or public-facing services like shops and hospitals. It said the same applies to trans men, who are biologically female, using men's toilets. However, trans people \"should not be put in a position where there are no facilities for them to use\", the watchdog also insisted. What else has the watchdog guidance said? According to the new guidance, schools must provide single-sex changing facilities for boys and girls over the age of eight. \"Suitable alternative provisions may be required\" for trans pupils, the watchdog said. It added that trans girls \"should not be permitted to use the girls' toilet or changing facilities, and pupils who identify as trans boys (biological girls) should not be permitted to use the boys' toilet or changing facilities\". Sports clubs and other associations of 25 or more people are allowed to be exclusively for biological men or women, the watchdog also said. Read more from Sky News:Pictures of Pope Francis's tomb released as it opens to publicBadenoch does not rule out local coalitions with Reform Sir Keir Starmer, who previously said \"transwomen are women\", welcomed the Supreme Court ruling and said the judgment provided \"clarity\" that \"a woman is an adult female\". The prime minister also said public services now needed to ensure their guidance was \"in the right place according to that judgment\". Mr McFadden was asked by the BBC's Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg what steps the government would take following the ruling and new interim guidance from the EHRC on the matter. He told the BBC: \"Well, we will all have to react to the court judgment and the guidance from the EHRC that you said, but, yes, that's the logical consequence of the judgment and the guidance that's come out - that people use the facilities of their biological sex. \"That's what the court said and that's what the guidance has said.\" Asked if it meant transgender people would be banned from using the toilets of the gender they identify as, Mr McFadden said: \"Look, in reality, when you say ban, am I going to be standing outside toilets? I'm probably not. \"There isn't going to be toilet police. But that is the logical consequence of the court ruling and the EHRC guidance.\" Meanwhile, Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch has called for a \"clear, medically supervised process\" for transitioning, rather than people self-identifying as transgender. Her comments come days after she clashed with Sir Keir on the issue and accused Labour ministers of lying about support for female-only spaces following Sir Keir's U-turn on his views about transgender women."

        "Content": "Counter-terror police are \"assessing\" a second video of a Kneecap performance - after it allegedly saw the rap trio calling for the death of Conservative MPs. The footage is believed to have been taken during one of the Northern Irish band's concerts in November 2023. One member of the group is alleged to have said: \"The only good Tory is a dead Tory. Kill your local MP.\" On Wednesday the Metropolitan Police revealed its counter-terror unit was investigating another clip of a Kneecap performance over claims it showed one member shouting: \"Up Hamas, up Hezbollah\". That video was from a Kneecap gig at London's Kentish Town Forum last November. Hamas and Hezbollah are both proscribed as terrorist groups in the UK. Under Section 12 of the Terrorism Act 2000, it is an offence to express \"an opinion or belief that is supportive of a proscribed organisation\". Commenting on the second clip, a Met Police spokesman said on Sunday: \"We were made aware of a video on April 22, believed to be from an event in November 2024, and it has been referred to the counter-terrorism internet referral unit for assessment and to determine whether any further police investigation may be required. \"We have also been made aware of another video believed to be from an event in November 2023.\" He added that the internet referral unit is \"assessing\" both clips to \"determine whether further police investigation is required\". In their statement in response to the previous Met investigation, Kneecap described it as a \"coordinated smear campaign\". They said they \"use their shows to call out the British and Irish governments' complicity in war crimes\" and that their fans \"see through the lies\".

We recognise the chilling effect that harassment and intimidation of elected representatives can have on our democracy. \"All reports of intimidation, harassment and threats are taken extremely seriously. We work with the police and Parliament to do everything in our power to crack down on threats to elected officials.\" Sky News has contacted Kneecap's management for further comment."

The blast, at the Shahid Rajaei container hub near the southern city of Bandar Abbas, happened on Saturday as Iran held a third round of talks with the US in Oman about Tehran's nuclear programme. Shipping containers burned, goods inside were badly damaged and the explosion was so powerful that windows several miles away were shattered, reports said.  Helicopters and aircraft dumped water from the air on the blaze and by Sunday afternoon it was 90% extinguished, the head of Iran's Red Crescent Society told state media. Officials said port activities had resumed in unaffected parts of Shahid Rajaei. Out of the 752 people who had received treatment for their injuries, 190 were still being treated in medical centres on Sunday, according to Iran's crisis management organisation. Chemicals at the port were suspected to have worsened the blast, but the exact cause of the explosion was not clear. \n                  Eighteen dead and more than 700 injured after chemical explosion at Iran's largest port\n                 \n                  Women in Iran increasingly deciding not to wear headscarves in public\n                 \n                  Inside Iran special - how close is a nuclear deal?\n                 Iran's defence ministry denied international media reports that the explosion may be connected to the mishandling of solid fuel used for missiles.

The Financial Times previously reported two Iranian vessels had shipped from China enough of the ingredient to propel up to 260 mid-range missiles. It was reportedly to help Tehran replenish stocks after its missile attacks on Israel in 2024. Iran's military has sought to deny the delivery of sodium perchlorate from China. Iran's state-run Irna news agency reported on Sunday that Russian President Vladimir Putin deployed several emergency aircraft to Bandar Abbas to provide help."

And under the sun outside Santa Maria Maggiore, they are awaiting the opportunity to visit his tomb. Francis, says Irena, \"was like a rainbow\" who lit up the world. Anna nods along: \"We are so happy to be here.\" The Pope's tomb has become a new source of pilgrimage. More than 30,000 people came to view it during the first morning after the Pope's funeral, the queue snaking from the front of the mighty basilica and then up and down across the square at the back. \n                  Pictures of Pope Francis's tomb released as it opens to the public in Rome basilica\n                 \n                  What Sky News correspondents witnessed at the Pope's funeral\n                 \n                  The Pope's funeral: In pictures\n                 Some were curious visitors, others were devout followers - priests and nuns mixing in the queue with tourists and devoted locals. All of these admired Francis; a very few actually knew him. Father Alessandro Masseroni is a deacon who came to Rome to train to become a priest. On his phone, he shows me a photo of him and Francis, with the Pope offering words of encouragement. He says: \"I had the honour to serve Pope Francis and to talk to him many times and it was a special experience. I understand why he was so loved by all the people - he was simple and direct. \"He was sunny. St Francis was his role model and when I saw the first picture of the Pope's tomb, the first thing I thought was of the tomb of St Francis of Assisi. \"Pope Francis will leave a legacy - it doesn't end with his death but will continue.\"  What are your emotions now, as you wait to visit his tomb, I ask. Father Alessandro pauses and smiles. \"Many emotions of course, but mainly, I thinkâ€¦ thankfulness.\" That has been a recurring aspect among so many of the people we have met in Rome over the past week - the sense that sadness for Francis's death is outweighed by the sense that his was a life that should be celebrated. Volodymyr Borysyak flew in from London on the morning of the Pope's funeral to make his third pilgrimage to Rome. Barely had he arrived than his phone was stolen, a crime he responded to by praying for the thief.

Instead, he is full of smiles.  \"We are happy to be the pilgrims of the world and this is a special day,\" he tells me. \"I know the pope used to pray in this basilica so that is why we will stay so long here to visit Santa Maria Maggiore. \"I think Pope Francis was, is and will be the pope for the world, because of the mercy of his heart and his love for everybody.\""

The UN said the building was fired on by an Israeli tank, which the IDF initially denied. However, on 24 April, the Israeli military admitted it fired on the building \"due to assessed enemy presence and was not identified by the forces as a UN facility\". UNOPS chief Jorge Moreira da Silva said at the time that Israel knew the location of the building and who was working there. He then claimed: \"This was not an accident.\" Read more:Israeli troops shot at Gaza aid workers 'point-blank'UN says food aid in Gaza has run out under Israel's blockade  Sky News understands that the IDF had been previously informed that the building belonged to the UN, and that this is being investigated by the IDF.

Sky News has learnt that Christine Hodgson, who chairs water company Severn Trent, and Andrew Martin, chair of the testing and inspection group Intertek, are the leading contenders for the Whitbread job. Mr Crozier, who has chaired the leisure group since 2018, is expected to step down later this year. The search, which has been taking place for several months, is expected to conclude in the coming weeks, according to one City source. Ms Hodgson has some experience of the leisure industry, having served on the board of Ladbrokes Coral Group until 2017, while Mr Martin was a senior executive at the contract caterer Compass Group and finance chief at the travel agent First Choice Holidays. Under Mr Crozier's stewardship, Whitbread has been radically reshaped, selling its Costa Coffee subsidiary to The Coca-Cola Company in 2019 for nearly Â£4bn. The company has also seen off an activist campaign spearheaded by Elliott Advisers, while Mr Crozier orchestrated the appointment of Dominic Paul, its chief executive, following Alison Brittain's retirement. \n                  Bank chiefs to Reeves: Ditch ring-fencing to boost UK economy\n                 \n                  Money blog: The food industry has a dirty secret - and it's making Britain poorer and unhealthier\n                 \n                  Post Office to unveil Â£1.75bn banking deal with big British lenders\n                 It said last year that it sees potential to grow the network from 86,000 UK bedrooms to 125,000 over the next decade or so.

        "Content": "\n          Political editor\n              @BethRigby\n This week's set of elections across England will be a series of firsts: it will be the first big ballot box test of Sir Keir Starmer's premiership and Kemi Badenoch's leadership of the Conservative Party. We will have the first by-election of this parliament in Labour-held Runcorn, the inaugural elections for the mayoralty of Hull and East Yorkshire and Lincolnshire, and our first chance to see if Reform's surge in the polls since the general election can translate into seats. In play are over 1,600 council seats, six mayoralties and the Labour-held seat of Runcorn and Helsby after a by-election was triggered by the Labour MP Mike Amesbury punching a constituent on a night out. And there is plenty at stake for the party leaders with all the upside in the hands of Nigel Farage, who has barely any council seats to defend and hundreds in his sights, as he looks to translate his poll leads into proper governing - be it through mayoral wins or council control. Sir Keir is bracing for an early verdict on his leadership, with the Runcorn by-election a test of nerves for a Labour Party that will be loathed to lose a seat in the northwest of England to a surging Reform Party. For the Conservatives, the pressure is obvious and acute. Of the 23 councils up for grabs, 16 are currently controlled by the Conservative Party and when they last fought these seats in 2021, the Conservatives were riding high on the back of a then popular Boris Johnson and COVID vaccine bounce. \n                  Kemi Badenoch does not rule out local coalitions with Reform after Thursday's council elections\n                 \n                  Tories 'are not doing a deal with Reform,' Kemi Badenoch insists\n                 \n                  Could the local elections reshape British politics?\n                 Back then, the party's national equivalent vote share - an estimate of how the country would have voted if everywhere had had a local election - was at 40%, with Labour at 30%, the Lib Dems at 15%, and other parties at 15%. Their support has collapsed since then, with current polling putting the Conservatives on 22% - an 18-point drop in vote share - while Reform, lumped in with 'other parties' in 2021, is now polling an average 25%. So, expect to see the Conservatives lose control of councils and hundreds of seats as it haemorrhages support to Reform in a night that is set to be miserable for Kemi Badenoch and her party. The Conservatives have majorities in 18 of the 23 councils up for grabs, and could even see the Lib Dems overtake them to become the second-biggest party in local government when it comes to council control. That would be a huge symbolic blow. The only glimmer of hope is whether the party can win the Cambridge and Peterborough mayoral race where a former Peterborough MP is looking to take the mayoralty from Labour.  But like the Conservatives, there is little for Labour to cling on to in this set of elections as the party prepares for a lacklustre night at the ballot box, reflecting its steady drop in the polls following the autumn budget. Support for Sir Keir's government dipped below 30% last November and has continued on that trajectory, with Labour currently polling on average around 23%. Labour has been haemorrhaging council seats in council by-elections since the national poll last July, and insiders are briefing that the party looks set to lose control of Doncaster Council, the only one it has control of in this set of elections, and perhaps the mayoralty of the city. Since last July, there have been by-elections in 95 vacant Labour council seats and Labour has lost 43 of them. But the biggest race on the night for Labour will be the Runcorn by-election, where Reform is challenging to take a parliamentary seat that has long been part of Labour's territory. While Reform set out with the aim to destroy the Conservative Party, Labour insiders know how bad the Reform surge is for their own prospects, with the party coming in second to Labour in 89 constituencies in the 2024 General Election. The party is all too aware of the threat of Nigel Farage, as Reform taps into voters' disillusionment. \"People voted for change in 2024,\" explains one Labour insider. \"We came in with the double whammy of public services on their knees and the economy facing big challenges, and we promised change. People will be judging us. There is change - waiting lists for the NHS are falling six months in a row - but do people notice it yet? Arguably not.\" Labour is preparing to intensify attacks against Reform. The party is already using remarks made by Mr Farage around re-examining the NHS's funding model to launch a series of attack ads around the local elections and is likely to step this up ahead of polling day. But the party is right to be worried by the Reform threat and to give you a bit of flavour of that, we ran a focus group of voters in Doncaster on the latest edition of the Electoral Dysfunction podcast to get a sense of the mood in a city about to re-elect its council and mayor. 'The country is stuck in a doom loop' Luke Tryl, director of More in Common, who carried out that focus group in Doncaster for us, told us that the group's disillusionment with politics and the main political parties was a common refrain all around the country. \"You know, people basically keep hitting the change button, right? You know, they did it in Brexit. They did in 2017 when [Jeremy] Corbyn does very well, Boris Johnson in 2019 was a sort of change and in 2024, change was literally the slogan of Keir Starmer's 2024 campaign. \"And they keep hitting that change and thinking they're not getting the change. And so actually it pervades right across the political spectrum. It's not limited to just the Tories, Labour, Reform. It's just this sense that something isn't happening and the system isn't responding to what we want,\" Mr Tryl says.  The undertone of the focus group reflected this sentiment, as respondents honed in on very common top-three concerns across the country - cost of living, the NHS, immigration - but also the sense of mistrust in politicians of all hues. \"It's not just that people think that the UK is in a bad state, you know, cost of living is bad, the NHS is bad, struggles with immigration, crime,\" Mr Tryl said. \"It's that they don't have faith in our political class to find solutions. I said recently, I think the UK public moves in a bit of a doom loop at the moment and we can't seem to find a way out of it and how that changes.\" This is helping Mr Farage's Reform as voters, turned off by the Tories and disappointed in Labour, look to hit the change button again. \"Britain is broken and needs Reform\" is Mr Farage's pitch. That's not to say that he was universally liked in our Doncaster focus group. \"It wasn't actually massively effusive about Farage personally, and we're starting to pick that up in a few more focus groups,\" noted Mr Tryl. \"It's rather more like, 'I like what Reform is saying' - people tend to particularly like what they say on immigration - but I've got a few questions about Farage and a word I've heard in other groups is baggage. He's got a lot of baggage.\" He added: \"What you're hearing there is people are slightly willing to put that... we tried the Tories for 14 years. We're not that happy with what we've had from Labour so far. So we may as well roll the dice on this guy. And I think that's what you're going to see next week is that rolling the dice.\"  The Conservatives fared particularly badly with the Doncaster focus group, with just two out of the nine respondents even being able to name their leader Kemi Badenoch. \"If you've got no public image whatsoever, and also no trust, then you're not going to pull any votes,\" was the brutal verdict of one respondent as Mr Johnson was brought up as a politician they thought of as more likeable, relatable and capable of taking on Reform. As for Labour, only one of the respondents seemed prepared to give the government more time to turn around the country and deliver on election promises, with others voicing criticism over the government's handling of the winter fuel allowance cuts, high immigration levels and the lack of progress more broadly. Voters were also hostile to Sir Keir, who they believed to be out of touch, privileged and posh. The best Sir Keir can hope for next week is, in the words of Mr Tryl is to \"tread water\" as we watch to see whether Reform can translate polling gains into real governing. A YouGov poll on Friday suggested Reform is in pole position to win the Lincolnshire mayoralty, while the party is ahead in the Hull and East Yorkshire battle, according to the polling. Labour is also nervous about Reform in the Doncaster mayoral race. ðŸ‘‰ Click here to listen to Electoral Dysfunction on your podcast app ðŸ‘ˆ Expectations for Reform are high, with some pollsters predicting the party could make hundreds of gains in traditionally Conservative counties and have a chance of perhaps even gaining control of Labour-held Doncaster council or Durham, where Labour is the largest party. Reform now has over 100 councillors, most of whom have defected from other parties, and is not defending any seats from 2021, so the only way for Mr Farage is up. Mr Tryl expects the Tories to lose 500 to 600 seats and Reform to pick up the same sort of numbers if it manages to organise its support and turn out the vote. Read more:Labour and Reform in battle for Runcorn by-election seatKemi Badenoch does not rule out local coalitions with Reform  So this will be a moment to test whether the Reform momentum in the polls translates into real progress on the ground and sees it become a major electoral force capable of challenging the two main parties across the country. In the general election, the party clocked up votes, but didn't manage to concentrate that support into concrete wins. Can Reform change that in 2025? This set of local elections is far smaller than normal when it comes to the number of councils being contested than normal (Labour's restructuring of local government has left a number of elections postponed), while the 11 million eligible to vote in England are just a quarter of those who could cast a vote across the UK in last year's general election. But these polls are seriously consequential. This will be a moment when we are able to better observe if the two-party system, battered in the 2024 General Election, really is dying. Last July, third parties secured more votes than ever and a record tally of seats as support for the two establishment parties hit a record low. These elections could be the moment that Reform tastes real power and the Liberal Democrats surge. Voters keep saying they want real change. On 1 May, we'll get a better sense of how serious they are in a set of elections that could point to a profoundly different future for British politics."

They have to do what is right for their communities.\" In response, Nigel Farage said: \"The Tories broke Britain nationally for 14 years, and their councils continue to break local communities with the highest taxes ever and worst services. \"Reform have no intention in forming coalitions with the Tories at any level.\" A total of 23 councils are up for grabs when voters go to the polls on Thursday 1 May - mostly in places that were once deemed Tory shires, until last year's general election. It includes 14 county councils, all but two of which have been Conservative-controlled, as well as eight unitary authorities, all but one of which are Tory. In addition, there is one Labour-controlled borough being contested. Ms Badenoch has set expectations low for the Tories, suggesting they could lose all the councils they are contesting. The last time this set of councils were up for election was in 2021, when the Conservative Party was led by Boris Johnson who was riding high from the COVID vaccine bounce. By Ali Fortescue, political correspondent  Will the right unite? A pact, merger, backroom deal â€“ the question of a Tory-Reform alliance is never far away. Today, Kemi Badenoch did not rule out local coalitions with Reform after Thursdayâ€™s local elections but shut down talk of a national deal. \"Read my lips,\" she said, \"I am not going into any coalition with Nigel Farage.\" But her party's messaging has been inconsistent. Ben Houchen, the Tees Valley Mayor, suggests \"coming together\" could work - Robert Jenrick's similar comments in a leaked recording are now well documented. For others, the idea is toxic - one senior Conservatives messages to say a pact would be \"electoral suicide\". Nigel Farage says he has no intention in coalition at any level. His former communications chief Gawain Towler tells me it's \"interesting and notable that the only people talking about pacts and deals are the Tories\". Deals at a local level are not unusual, the bigger question is whether there will be movement at a national level. Who really needs who? Reform UK only have five seats in parliament, but they now often poll ahead of the Tories. A merger of equals seems unlikely. In any pact, someone must come out on top, and it's hard to see Nigel Farage agreeing to serve under Kemi Badenoch. Both sides will argue they have different approaches and policy points, and Reform are chasing Labour too, but as a general election gets closer could principles gives way to practicalities? For now, the fight for the right goes on as Reform and the Conservatives try to work out how not to hand Keir Starmer a second term. Despite not ruling out agreements between the Tories and Reform once the local elections have finished, Ms Badenoch has been at pains to stress she is against any kind of deal with Mr Farage at a national level. On Friday she criticised talk of \"stitch-ups\" ahead of next week's local elections and said she was instead focused on ensuring that voters have a \"credible Conservative offer\". Speculation that the Tories and Reform could join forces heightened after two senior Tories appeared to advocate for some sort of agreement between the two rival parties. Robert Jenrick, the shadow justice secretary, was captured in a video recording leaked to Sky News vowing to  \"bring this coalition together\" to ensure that Conservatives and Reform UK are no longer competing for votes by the time of the next general election.  According to the excusive audio Mr Jenrick - who lost the Tory leadership campaign to Ms Badenoch - said he would try \"one way or another\" to make sure the two right-wing parties do not end up handing a second term to Sir Keir Starmer. Mr Jenrick has denied his words amounted to calling for a pact with Reform. Meanwhile, in an interview with Politico, Tees Valley Mayor Ben Houchen also suggested the two parties should join forces in some way. \"I don't know what it looks like. I don't know whether it's a pact. I don't know whether it's a mergerâ€¦ [or] a pact of trust and confidence or whatever,\" he said. \"But if we want to make sure that there is a sensible centre-right party leading this country, then there is going to have to be a coming together of Reform and the Conservative Party in some way.\" Read more:Could the local elections reshape British politics?'Bring on the fight' over net zero, says Ed Miliband All of the other national parties have launched their campaigns for the local elections ahead of the poll next week. Labour Cabinet Office minister Pat McFadden told Trevor Phillips that he was \"not predicting huge Labour gains on Thursday\". He also ruled out Labour striking deals with any other party. \"The deals on offer after Thursday won't be between Labour and the Tories and Labour and Reform,\" he said. \"But what there's been a lot of debate about is what's going to happen between the Tories and Reform, because I'm not even sure if they're two different parties or one party at the moment.\""

However, Mr McFadden, a key ally of Sir Keir Starmer, struck a more cautious tone than Chancellor Rachel Reeves on the prospect of a US trade deal, saying: \"I think an agreement is possible - I don't think it's certain, and I don't want to say it's certain, but I think it's possible.\" He went on to say the government wanted an \"agreement in the UK's interests\" and not a \"hasty deal\", amid fears from critics that Number 10 could acquiesce a deal that lowers food standards, for example, or changes certain taxes in a bid to persuade Donald Trump to lower some of the tariffs that have been placed on British goods.

We've still got work to do, and we're doing that work with our partners in the EU.\" The Cabinet Office minister also rejected suggestions the UK would have to choose between pursuing a trade deal with the US and one with the EU - the latter of which has banned chlorinated chicken in its markets - as has the UK - but which the US has historically wanted.

I think that's to misunderstand the nature of the UK economy, and I don't think would be in our interests to put all our eggs in one basket.\" Also speaking to Trevor Phillips was Tory leader Kemi Badenoch, who said the government should be close to closing the deal with the US \"because we got very close last time President Trump was in office\". She also insisted food standards should not be watered down in order to get a deal, saying she did not reach an agreement with Canada when she was in government for that reason. \"What Labour needs to do now is show that they can get a deal that isn't making concessions, so we can have what we had last month before the trade tariffs, and we need serious people doing this,\" she said."

        "Content": "Counter-terror police are \"assessing\" a second video of a Kneecap performance - after it allegedly saw the rap trio calling for the death of Conservative MPs. The footage is believed to have been taken during one of the Northern Irish band's concerts in November 2023. One member of the group is alleged to have said: \"The only good Tory is a dead Tory. Kill your local MP.\" On Wednesday the Metropolitan Police revealed its counter-terror unit was investigating another clip of a Kneecap performance over claims it showed one member shouting: \"Up Hamas, up Hezbollah\". That video was from a Kneecap gig at London's Kentish Town Forum last November. Hamas and Hezbollah are both proscribed as terrorist groups in the UK. Under Section 12 of the Terrorism Act 2000, it is an offence to express \"an opinion or belief that is supportive of a proscribed organisation\". Commenting on the second clip, a Met Police spokesman said on Sunday: \"We were made aware of a video on April 22, believed to be from an event in November 2024, and it has been referred to the counter-terrorism internet referral unit for assessment and to determine whether any further police investigation may be required. \"We have also been made aware of another video believed to be from an event in November 2023.\" He added that the internet referral unit is \"assessing\" both clips to \"determine whether further police investigation is required\". In their statement in response to the previous Met investigation, Kneecap described it as a \"coordinated smear campaign\". They said they \"use their shows to call out the British and Irish governments' complicity in war crimes\" and that their fans \"see through the lies\".

A UK government spokesman commented: \"We unequivocally condemn threatening remarks made towards any individual. \"Political intimidation and abuse must have no place in our society. We recognise the chilling effect that harassment and intimidation of elected representatives can have on our democracy. \"All reports of intimidation, harassment and threats are taken extremely seriously. We work with the police and Parliament to do everything in our power to crack down on threats to elected officials.\" Sky News has contacted Kneecap's management for further comment."
