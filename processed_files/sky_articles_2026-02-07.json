        "Content": "A payment given to Lord Peter Mandelson when he was sacked as ambassador to the US is being reviewed after the latest revelations in the Epstein files.   The peer lost his role in September last year over his relationship with paedophile financier Jeffrey Epstein, just seven months into the job. However, anger in Westminster has grown after the last release of documents, which indicated he leaked information to his friend while he was a government minister. Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer's allies have said he should give the taxpayer-funded handout, which could run into the tens of thousands, back or donate it to a victims' charity. \"Given what we know now, Mandelson should either pay the money back or give it to a charity to support victims,\" a Downing Street source said. The Foreign Office said a review had been launched \"in light of further information that has now been revealed\". The payoff Lord Mandelson received could be as high as £55,000 before tax and deductions, the Sunday Times reported. \n                  'Shocked, sad, angry, betrayed, let down': Gordon Brown on former ally Peter Mandelson\n                 \n                  Police search Peter Mandelson's properties in Camden and Wiltshire\n                 \n                  Labour MPs urge Starmer to reveal if he saw peer's warnings about Mandelson's Epstein links\n                 The Foreign Office previously said it had \"reached a settlement in order to terminate Peter Mandelson's civil service employment with immediate effect, in accordance with legal advice and the terms and conditions of his employment\". Full details of the payoff are set to be revealed in parliament after MPs backed a call for the papers relating to his time in government to be disclosed. The Sunday Times suggests it could be between £38,750 and £55,000, which is based on a three-month payoff of the highest annual salary in the diplomatic service between £155,000 and £220,000. A Foreign Office spokesman said: \"Peter Mandelson's civil service employment was terminated in September 2025 in accordance with legal advice and the terms and conditions of his employment. \"Normal civil service HR processes were followed. Further information will be provided to Parliament as part of the government response to the motion passed last week which is being coordinated by cabinet office. \"A review has been instigated in light of further information that has now been revealed and the ongoing police investigation.\" Lord Mandelson has been accused of sharing market-sensitive information with Epstein after the 2008 global financial crisis. Police investigating claims of misconduct in a public office by Lord Mandelson have concluded their searches of two of his properties - in Camden, north London, and in Wiltshire. The Metropolitan Police said the criminal investigation is \"complex\" and will require a \"significant amount of further evidence gathering and analysis\".

Adrian Darbishire KC arrived at the property shortly before midday, before leaving around 90 minutes later."

        "Content": "Italian police have fired tear gas and water cannon at protesters who threw firecrackers, smoke bombs and bottles at them near a Winter Olympics venue. Officers in riot gear and with shields confronted about 100 protesters, some of whom wore hoods and scarves to cover their faces, after they broke away from a main demonstration and appeared to be trying to reach the Santagiulia Olympic ice hockey rink. A group of protesters also set off smoke bombs and firecrackers about half a mile (800 metres) from the Olympic Village, where around 1,500 athletes are staying. Six people were arrested during the altercation, according to police sources. The main demonstration saw an estimated 10,000 people taking to the streets of Milan on Saturday, on the first full day of the Winter Olympics, to protest against the environmental, economic and social impact of the Games.

Protesters carried cardboard cutouts of trees to represent the trees that were felled to build the new bobsled run in Cortina for the Olympics, arguing that infrastructure projects like this have damaged the environment in mountain communities. \"They bypassed the laws that usually are needed for major infrastructure projects, citing urgency for the Games,\" one protester said, adding that he was concerned that the private company organising the event would eventually pass on debt to Italian taxpayers. The International Olympic Committee argues that the Games largely use existing facilities, making them more sustainable.

US Homeland Security Investigations, an ICE unit that focuses on cross-border crimes, often sends officers to events abroad like the Olympics to help with security. The ICE unit used to crack down on immigration in the US is known as Enforcement and Removal Operations, and there is no indication its officers have been deployed to Italy."

        "Content": "\n          Presenter\n       When I first saw the image of Barack and Michelle Obama as apes come across my social media I thought it must have been fake. I know the US president and those around him have said and done some despicably racist things in the past - but this? Read more: Trump says he didn't make a mistake over Obamas as apes video Prior to being in office, Donald Trump and his father, Fred, were sued by the US Department of Justice in the 70s for refusing to rent apartments to black tenants. He then, in the 80s, led calls for the death penalty for five young black men, who became known as the \"Central Park Five\", who were wrongly convicted of a brutal rape. And even when it became clear they were innocent, he continued to claim they were guilty. And he was the one who led the racist conspiracy theory that Barack Obama was not a legitimate president because, as Trump loudly and wrongly claimed, Obama wasn't born in the US - that became known as the birther conspiracy. But even with that history - and there are more examples - I still could not really believe what I was seeing when that image came across my timeline. Never did I think I'd see a sitting president of the United States posting such a video containing such an overt, unquestionably racist image. The argument made by some that this video, when played in full, isn't racist, is laughable in its naivety and offensive in its assumption about the audience which saw it. Its creator made a decision to depict the Obamas as apes. Its poster made a decision to share it on his platform. Not that this should need explaining, but the dehumanisation of black people in this way is a trope dating back hundreds of years. It's something which had, for many years, been confined to the dustbin of history, while still very much a part of the vocabulary of white supremacists. But something has changed. Maybe it's social media, maybe it's something else, but something has changed. We are in a new reality where, for more than 12 hours, Trump's White House thought this was OK. As I was preparing for today, my five-year-old son was running around the house playing. Each time he passed my screen and that image was up, I had to move my laptop. I didn't want him to see it, to have to explain that, to have to have that conversation. But have that conversation I will, as my mother had with me. There has been an increase in racist language and behaviour online, where it's found an audience and metastasised. It's hard to quantify how much it's increased, as social sites are many and disparate. In the US, a study in the Journal of Epidemiology found in an analysis of 55 million tweets between 2011 and 2021, a 16% increase in racist language. The New York Times reports antisemitic and anti-Muslim hate speech jumped by 919% and 422% respectively in the aftermath of the Hamas attacks on October 7 and the Israeli response. And a study from Goldsmiths University here in the UK found 95% of minority groups see racist content online - 16% see it every day and 42% of those asked said it was damaging to their mental health. So this sort of thing matters. This will not be the last time something like this happens - the White House has taken it down, blaming a junior staffer - which is odd as we are told Trump does all his own posting and it went up at midnight - but at least it's not up there anymore. But the damage has been done, whatever mask there may have been has slipped. The test for all of us now comes in how we respond the next time it happens. Donald Trump has not apologised for the video, shared on his Truth Social account, depicting Barack and Michelle Obama as apes, saying \"I didn't make a mistake\". The post was deleted around 12 hours after being shared. The US president said \"of course\" he condemned the racist parts of the video. In 1973, the Department of Justice sued Donald Trump and his father for alleged racial discrimination at Trump housing developments in New York. The case was settled two years later with no admission of guilt. The five men wrongly convicted of raping a woman in Central Park have sued Donald Trump on accusations of making \"false and defamatory\" statements during a presidential debate against former vice president Kamala Harris in 2024.  Mr Trump has tried to have the lawsuit dismissed, but has so far been unsuccessful."

        "Content": "\n          Asia correspondent\n              @HelenAnnSmith0\n Japanese politics is politer and more understated than most. It's perhaps the reason that Western audiences do not always pay a huge amount of attention. But something feels different this time, and that's largely down to the woman at the centre of this story; the drum-playing, Trump-hugging, China-provoking prime minister who has raised the stakes for both Japan and the region. In central Tokyo, just a few hours before polls opened in the snap election she called, hundreds of people crowded into a small local park to see Sanae Takaichi. Despite the bitterly cold temperatures and the fact that many struggled to see her over the sea of heads, there was a sense that something significant was unfolding. \"I was just passing,\" one woman told me, \"but I couldn't not stop to see her!\" There is no disputing the fact that Takaichi is just different to those who have gone before her. She's a former heavy metal drummer and motorbike rider, and she is happy to jump around the stage at rallies and sing to visiting foreign leaders (Italy's Giorgia Meloni was greeted with a rousing happy birthday). Her outsized character in a scene historically so male and so dry has led to soaring personal approval ratings, 2.6 million followers on X and a one-year wait to buy her signature black handbag. Not to mention the reversal of fortunes seen by her struggling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP): it now looks set to take a majority in Japan's Lower House, just four months after she assumed the leadership in the wake of her unpopular predecessor's resignation. Read more: Can Japan's first female PM tighten her grip on power? Japan's 'Iron Lady' will pursue conservative vision if she wins But she's also far from the liberal champion many might have hoped for in the country's first female leader; she is, in fact, ultra conservative. She's anti gay marriage and a vocal defender of traditional gender roles; she sees Margaret Thatcher as a role model and has leant into a rising feeling of \"foreigner fatigue\" in Japan, directed both at immigrants and tourists. If she secures her own mandate at Sunday's election, it is this conservative vision that she will be pursuing. 'She's like a friendly neighbour or sister' In her hometown of Nara, they think that is a good thing. Here, a small minivan has been converted into a \"battle bus\" of sorts, and her dedicated team of supporters are driving it around the traditional streets, asking locals to sign it, calling her name through the megaphones and asking for their votes. \"She's like a friendly neighbour or sister,\" one old man tells us as he remembers her starting out in politics. 'She is simply doing what is necessary to protect Japan' When I ask one of her team what he makes of her conservative views, he simply responds: \"Rather than labelling it conservatism, I think she is simply doing what is necessary to protect Japan.\" Of course, in any election, domestic policy is a focus; she favours tax cuts and increased public spending to boost a sluggish economy. But the area of her policy that has brought the most attention and the most ire has been her approach to foreign policy and, particularly, her approach to China. Support from Trump According to its constitution, Japan is still a pacifist country, and it has thus long relied on the US for its security. Takaichi has made a particular point of cosying up to Donald Trump's America; his visit to Japan last year was notable for the excess of its warmth, and Trump has actively endorsed her campaign. But she has also been highly hawkish in her attitudes to Japan's largest and most powerful neighbour. The two were already set to be at odds; Takaichi's plan to spend more on and build up Japan's military is a deeply sore point in China, which suffered enormously at its hands during the Second World War. Read more from Sky News:Trump says he didn't make a mistake over Obamas as apes videoOver 80 flood warnings issued in UK as more downpours expected Mixed feelings about standing up to China But things plunged to a new low in November when she said that a Chinese attack on the island of Taiwan (a self-governing democracy that China sees as a breakaway province) would amount to an \"existential threat\" to Japan, and it would have the right to intervene militarily. The comments have caused outrage in China, drawing a raft of damaging retaliations, from the banning of the imports of Japanese seafood to restrictions on its access to crucial rare metals and a pointed suggestion that Chinese travellers should avoid it. Relations are at their lowest ebb for over a decade, and while some Japanese are happy to see their leader stand up to China, others are anxious. \"Seeing China imposing economic sanctions, it proves how thoughtless her remarks were,\" one man at her rally tells me. \"It's definitely more dangerous.\" The reality is that for all the Instagrammable moments, Takaichi's stance on China might well be the key issue that plagues and potentially even defines her leadership; it is not a disagreement that the Chinese will just let go. Japan's lean to the right under a Takaichi-style nationalism might well bring a renewed sense of pride to some, but it could also bring a new jeopardy to all."

On Friday, Iranian and US officials met in Muscat, Oman, to hold indirect nuclear talks. The talks came amid a continued American naval build-up near Iran, which Donald Trump has described as an \"armada\". The US president has repeatedly threatened to take military action since the Iranian regime launched a bloody crackdown against protesters who took to the streets of cities across the country last month. Both sides said more talks are expected to be held soon. On Thursday, the White House press secretary, Karoline Leavitt, told reporters: \"While these negotiations are taking place, I would remind the Iranian regime that the president has many options at ​his disposal, aside from diplomacy as the commander in chief of the most powerful military in the history of the world.\" A regional diplomat who had been briefed by Iran told Reuters news agency that Iran insisted on its \"right to enrich uranium\" during the negotiations. \n                  Iran and US to begin high-stakes talks amid fears of conflict\n                 \n                  After the crackdown: what is happening on the streets of Iran? \n                 \n                  Is Donald Trump about to defy the US Constitution?\n                 The diplomat also said Iran's missile capabilities were not raised in the discussions. Iranian officials ruled out putting the country's missiles, which make up one of the largest missile arsenals in the Middle East, up for discussion. Iran also wants recognition of its right to enrich uranium. \"The prime minister believes that any negotiations must include limiting ballistic missiles and halting support ​for the Iranian axis,\" said the office of Mr Netanyahu, in a statement."

        "Content": "Dozens of flood warnings are in place, along with more than 250 alerts, as relentless rain continues to lash the UK. The Environment Agency (EA) has issued 77 warnings for England, meaning flooding is expected, mainly concentrated in the South West and Midlands. A further 244 flood alerts are in force, meaning flooding is possible, stretching from North Yorkshire to Cornwall, and from the Welsh borders to Norfolk.

The EA usually issues flood warnings 30 minutes to two hours before flooding, according to its website. Broadcast meteorologist • Aberdeen has had zero hours of sunshine since 21 January. It's the longest sunless period there since 1957. • Sheffield has had zero hours of sunshine so far this month.\n • Katesbridge had its wettest February day on record on 5 February - 67.2mm in 24 hours, beating the previous February site record of 42.2mm in 1985. • It's rained every day for the last 37 days in the UK - every day so far this year.\n • Several sites across the UK haven't had an entirely dry day since 30 December, which would mean rain on Sunday would be the 40th consecutive day. • Exeter Airport has not had a dry day since 31 December. • The UK as a whole has had below-average sunshine hours for winter so far. • Rainfall has been quite varied depending on where you live. For example, Eastern Scotland has been very wet, Western Scotland very dry. It issues them when flooding is expected from rivers, from heavy rains that could cause flash floods, and from high tides and surges coupled with strong winds at sea.

England flood alertsScotland flood alertsWales flood alertsNI flood alerts Sunday offers a more mixed picture, with showers and some sunshine, before wet and windy conditions resume at the start of next week. Rain has fallen every day of 2026 in the South West and South Wales, the Met Office announced this week. Both regions have faced 50% more rainfall than usual for January, the forecaster said. Meanwhile, the South East received nearly a third of its average February rainfall in just the first three days of the month. Read more:When will the rain end? What the Met Office is sayingMigrant crossings hit five-year low in stormy January Broadcast meteorologist So far, February is continuing where January left off - grey and wet. Cornwall had its wettest January on record and other parts of the British Isles weren't far behind. If you feel the rain has been relentless, you'd be right. Many places, including Exeter Airport, have recorded rainfall every single day this year. And all that cloud means very little sunshine, adding to the gloomy feel. Aberdeen went nearly two weeks without a glimmer of brightness, and at the moment eastern Scotland has recorded just 1% of their monthly sunshine for February. In just the first five days of February, the city of Aberdeen has also recorded more than their usual monthly rainfall. And the Isle of Wight isn't far behind, currently at 97% of their February rainfall and rising. For context, you would expect them to be around 18% at this stage of the month. So what's going on? The culprit, as it often the case with our weather, is the jet stream. This fast-moving ribbon of air high in our atmosphere steers areas of low pressure around on the ground. Instead of flowing nicely from west to east, it's currently meandering down to the south and this wavy jet has led to blocked weather patterns. Scandinavia is under a large area of high pressure, with settled and largely dry conditions, but we've been stuck with low after low, and a dominant southeasterly airflow has sent bands of showery rain northwards across the country. The jet stream's southerly position has also meant a lot more rain across southern parts of the UK. It turns out northwest Scotland has been quietly enjoying the best of the dry and bright weather. When is it going to improve? There will be some drier and brighter spells between the rainbands but the overall unsettled outlook continues right into next month, not good news for those places already struggling. Until the weather pattern \"unblocks\", there is more rain to come. And things could turn colder with a risk of wintry hazards towards the end of next week. If it's any consolation, we're not alone with these exceptional rainfall totals. A succession of storms has battered Iberia, with Storm Marta the latest to affect Portugal, Spain and Gibraltar this weekend, following on a very wet January which saw some places receive three times the normal rainfall. \"Unfortunately, there's no end in sight,\" said Dan Stroud, operational meteorologist with the Met Office. His colleague Alex Deakin said the trend continued on Friday. He said: \"Friday's been a very soggy day across a good chunk of the country, cold wind continuing to feed in the cloud and the moisture across north-east England and eastern Scotland.\" Speaking earlier this week, Mr Stroud blamed a \"big area of high pressure\" for the sustained bleakness. He said: \"Very little in the way of change, and the reason for it really is that we've got a big area of high pressure way out to the far north and east of the country, and that's stopping areas of low pressure from moving through. \"Until that area of high pressure sort of shifts out of the way, we're not really going to see much of a change in the forecast. \"At the same time, we've got the jet stream way to the south, bringing exceptional wet weather to Spain and Portugal.\""

        "Content": "\n          Sports correspondent\n              @RobHarris\n For a largely sedate and elegant spectacle, the Winter Olympics opening ceremony still became an outlet for rage in Milan. Pleas from International Olympic Committee (IOC) president Kirsty Coventry to be respectful were ignored when four Israelis entered the San Siro in the athlete parade. You had to listen carefully, but boos could be heard over the music in the vast stadium. Simultaneous parades were held at Games clusters across northern Italy - while jeering was reported in Predazzo, there were cheers when Israelis marched in the mountain resort of Cortina d'Ampezzo. Israel has endured more harrowing days at the Olympics, with 11 of their athletes murdered by Palestinian terrorists in a massacre at Munich in 1972. For these Olympics, the IOC faced pressure to ban Israel from competing over the thousands killed in the post-7 October war in Gaza, but rejected those calls. The jeering demonstrated the animosity of some in the crowd towards the Jewish state, with hostility over conflict and geopolitical tensions hard to escape in the ceremony. \n                  Italian police fire tear gas at protesters near Olympics venue\n                 \n                  In pictures: The Winter Olympics opening day\n                 \n                  Crotch enhancements: The latest controversy at the Winter Olympics\n                 Read more: Follow all the updates from the Winter Olympics in Italy Fractures between Europe and the United States were also evident. While American athletes entered to cheers, the brief appearance of vice president JD Vance, waving Stars and Stripes flags with wife, Usha, did prompt more booing and whistling. Anger against the Trump administration has been evident in the buildup to the Games, with protests against Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents being here to protect the US delegation, weeks after their personnel killed two American citizens. But if you were watching on television, you probably didn't hear the booing - drowned out by music or commentators. Italians will have revelled in hearing Mariah Carey paying homage to the hosts by singing iconic 1950s hit Volare in Italian. Maybe you did hear the cheers for Ukraine, a show of solidarity four years into the full-scale invasion by Russia, whose team remains banned. There were enthusiastic roars, too, for Venezuela following Trump's military interventions. The IOC wanted to show a world uniting through sport, hoping these Games are a platform for compassion to shine rather than conflict. \"You'll show us that strength isn't just about winning,\" Ms Coventry told athletes in her address. \"It's about courage, empathy and heart.\" Read more from Sky News:Here's what we've found in Epstein filesNigerian court orders UK to pay £420m It is about a vast Olympics. For the next two weeks, five sporting clusters across northern Italy will be in the sporting spotlight. An Olympic Games has never been as sprawling across such a large footprint. It is an even wider platform-to-platform. But Ms Coventry told her first opening ceremony leading the Olympics that \"when we see rivals embrace at the finish line, we are reminded that we can choose respect\"."

        "Content": "A payment given to Lord Peter Mandelson when he was sacked as ambassador to the US is being reviewed after the latest revelations in the Epstein files.   The peer lost his role in September last year over his relationship with paedophile financier Jeffrey Epstein, just seven months into the job. However, anger in Westminster has grown after the last release of documents, which indicated he leaked information to his friend while he was a government minister. Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer's allies have said he should give the taxpayer-funded handout, which could run into the tens of thousands, back or donate it to a victims' charity. \"Given what we know now, Mandelson should either pay the money back or give it to a charity to support victims,\" a Downing Street source said. The Foreign Office said a review had been launched \"in light of further information that has now been revealed\". The payoff Lord Mandelson received could be as high as £55,000 before tax and deductions, the Sunday Times reported. \n                  'Shocked, sad, angry, betrayed, let down': Gordon Brown on former ally Peter Mandelson\n                 \n                  Police search Peter Mandelson's properties in Camden and Wiltshire\n                 \n                  Labour MPs urge Starmer to reveal if he saw peer's warnings about Mandelson's Epstein links\n                 The Foreign Office previously said it had \"reached a settlement in order to terminate Peter Mandelson's civil service employment with immediate effect, in accordance with legal advice and the terms and conditions of his employment\". Full details of the payoff are set to be revealed in parliament after MPs backed a call for the papers relating to his time in government to be disclosed. The Sunday Times suggests it could be between £38,750 and £55,000, which is based on a three-month payoff of the highest annual salary in the diplomatic service between £155,000 and £220,000. A Foreign Office spokesman said: \"Peter Mandelson's civil service employment was terminated in September 2025 in accordance with legal advice and the terms and conditions of his employment. \"Normal civil service HR processes were followed. Further information will be provided to Parliament as part of the government response to the motion passed last week which is being coordinated by cabinet office. \"A review has been instigated in light of further information that has now been revealed and the ongoing police investigation.\" Lord Mandelson has been accused of sharing market-sensitive information with Epstein after the 2008 global financial crisis. Police investigating claims of misconduct in a public office by Lord Mandelson have concluded their searches of two of his properties - in Camden, north London, and in Wiltshire.

        "Content": "Peter Mandelson committed a \"betrayal of his country\" by allegedly leaking government secrets to Jeffrey Epstein and putting Britain \"at risk\", former prime minister Gordon Brown has said. Lord Mandelson, his ex-business secretary, has been accused of sharing market-sensitive information with the US sex offender after the 2008 global financial crisis. Mr Brown has since been asked about how he felt about his former colleague's behaviour, to which he replied he was \"shocked, sad, angry, betrayed, let down\". \"All of the information he passed on... the papers by other advisers were commercially sensitive; this was financially secret information,\" Mr Brown said. \"It meant that Britain was at risk because of that, the currency was at risk, some of the trading that would happen would be speculative as a result of that. \"There's no doubt that huge commercial damage could have been done and perhaps was done.\" On Saturday afternoon, a top corporate and financial crime lawyer visited Lord Mandelson's house near Regent's Park, London. \n                  We've combed through thousands of pages, photos and videos - here's what we've found in Epstein files\n                 \n                  Norway's crown princess Mette-Marit apologises over Epstein links\n                 \n                  Can Starmer survive the Mandelson scandal? \n                 Adrian Darbishire KC arrived at the property shortly before midday, before leaving around 90 minutes later.

He has previously said: \"I was wrong to believe Epstein following his conviction [in 2008 for procuring a child for prostitution and of soliciting a prostitute] and to continue my association with him afterwards. \"I apologise unequivocally for doing so to the women and girls who suffered.\" It comes as police investigating claims of misconduct in a public office by Lord Mandelson have concluded their searches of two of his properties - in Camden, north London, and in Wiltshire. The Metropolitan Police said the criminal investigation is \"complex\" and will require a \"significant amount of further evidence gathering and analysis\". Mr Brown spoke after emails released as part of the Epstein files revealed the correspondence between Lord Mandelson and the paedophile financier. In the messages, the former Labour peer appears to brief Epstein on internal discussions at the heart of UK government, including giving him advance notice of a €500bn EU bank bailout in 2010. He also told him he was \"trying hard\" to change government policy on bankers' bonuses. The then chancellor Alistair Darling announced a 50% \"super tax\" on bonuses in December 2009, in a bid to prevent pay being inflated by taxpayer-funded bailouts. The documents further suggest that Epstein sent money to Lord Mandelson and his partner, Reinaldo Avila da Silva. Lord Mandelson twice resigned from government amid controversy under Tony Blair, before Mr Brown brought him back into the cabinet. \"I made mistakes, I regret it, it shouldn't have happened,\" Mr Brown said. He said he and his colleagues had been betrayed by Lord Mandelson. But, he added, \"the biggest betrayal was of the women and girls that were trafficked, that were exploited, that were treated as less than human\". He said Sir Keir Starmer had likewise made a mistake by appointing Lord Mandelson as Britain's ambassador to the US last year. \"Keir Starmer was misled and he was betrayed,\" Mr Brown said. \"He has clearly said it was the wrong decision, and it was the wrong decision. Just as I made a mistake, he made a mistake.\" But the ex-prime minister also hailed the current one as a man of \"integrity\". He blamed a \"systemic failure\" in vetting for Lord Mandelson's appointment. \"Mandelson, of course, did appear... to have an unblemished record as the trade commissioner for four years,\" he said. \"Nobody had ever heard of Epstein in the government, and nobody knew of any friendship between Epstein and Mandelson at that time.\" Read more:What do the Epstein files say about Lord Peter Mandelson?Police search Peter Mandelson's properties A government spokesperson said: \"The shameful and disgraceful behaviour revealed this week is wholly incompatible with public service, and it is right that no one is above accountability... We have already strengthened the Ministerial Code... But Gordon Brown is right that further action is needed in light of what has emerged this week - and we have already begun urgent work on how we can do more.\" 'If he doesn't get rid of McSweeney, he's lost the confidence of PLP' On Saturday, MP for Kingston upon Hull East, Karl Turner, called for Downing Street chief of staff, Morgan McSweeney, to go following the Mandelson accusations. Many Labour MPs blame Mr McSweeney for the decision to appoint Lord Mandelson. He told Sky News: \"If the prime minister doesn't get rid of Mr McSweeney, he's lost the confidence of the PLP, it's as simple as that, I don't want it to be the case but it's true.\" He said before that: \"This prime minister would do well to listen to Gordon Brown. I think Gordon Brown should be brought in, actually, to sort out this mess and come up with a plan to clean politics up. \"I think that is something that Gordon would be willing to do, I think the prime minister ought to use him in that regard.\""

        "Content": "Dozens of flood warnings are in place, along with more than 250 alerts, as relentless rain continues to lash the UK. The Environment Agency (EA) has issued 77 warnings for England, meaning flooding is expected, mainly concentrated in the South West and Midlands. A further 244 flood alerts are in force, meaning flooding is possible, stretching from North Yorkshire to Cornwall, and from the Welsh borders to Norfolk. Natural Resources Wales has another 11 flood alerts in place across the border. Scotland has one flood warning and five flood alerts. Check the weather forecast in your area Warwickshire Fire and Rescue Service also warned that levels in the River Dene had \"risen to a state where flooding is imminent\". The EA usually issues flood warnings 30 minutes to two hours before flooding, according to its website. Broadcast meteorologist • Aberdeen has had zero hours of sunshine since 21 January. It's the longest sunless period there since 1957. • Sheffield has had zero hours of sunshine so far this month.\n • Katesbridge had its wettest February day on record on 5 February - 67.2mm in 24 hours, beating the previous February site record of 42.2mm in 1985. • It's rained every day for the last 37 days in the UK - every day so far this year.\n • Several sites across the UK haven't had an entirely dry day since 30 December, which would mean rain on Sunday would be the 40th consecutive day. • Exeter Airport has not had a dry day since 31 December. • The UK as a whole has had below-average sunshine hours for winter so far. • Rainfall has been quite varied depending on where you live. For example, Eastern Scotland has been very wet, Western Scotland very dry. It issues them when flooding is expected from rivers, from heavy rains that could cause flash floods, and from high tides and surges coupled with strong winds at sea. More wet weather is predicted for large parts of the country on Saturday, including blustery showers in the South West and heavy showers in South Wales. England flood alertsScotland flood alertsWales flood alertsNI flood alerts Sunday offers a more mixed picture, with showers and some sunshine, before wet and windy conditions resume at the start of next week. Rain has fallen every day of 2026 in the South West and South Wales, the Met Office announced this week. Both regions have faced 50% more rainfall than usual for January, the forecaster said. Meanwhile, the South East received nearly a third of its average February rainfall in just the first three days of the month. Read more:When will the rain end? What the Met Office is sayingMigrant crossings hit five-year low in stormy January Broadcast meteorologist So far, February is continuing where January left off - grey and wet. Cornwall had its wettest January on record and other parts of the British Isles weren't far behind. If you feel the rain has been relentless, you'd be right. Many places, including Exeter Airport, have recorded rainfall every single day this year. And all that cloud means very little sunshine, adding to the gloomy feel. Aberdeen went nearly two weeks without a glimmer of brightness, and at the moment eastern Scotland has recorded just 1% of their monthly sunshine for February. In just the first five days of February, the city of Aberdeen has also recorded more than their usual monthly rainfall. And the Isle of Wight isn't far behind, currently at 97% of their February rainfall and rising. For context, you would expect them to be around 18% at this stage of the month. So what's going on? The culprit, as it often the case with our weather, is the jet stream. This fast-moving ribbon of air high in our atmosphere steers areas of low pressure around on the ground. Instead of flowing nicely from west to east, it's currently meandering down to the south and this wavy jet has led to blocked weather patterns. Scandinavia is under a large area of high pressure, with settled and largely dry conditions, but we've been stuck with low after low, and a dominant southeasterly airflow has sent bands of showery rain northwards across the country. The jet stream's southerly position has also meant a lot more rain across southern parts of the UK. It turns out northwest Scotland has been quietly enjoying the best of the dry and bright weather. When is it going to improve? There will be some drier and brighter spells between the rainbands but the overall unsettled outlook continues right into next month, not good news for those places already struggling. Until the weather pattern \"unblocks\", there is more rain to come. And things could turn colder with a risk of wintry hazards towards the end of next week. If it's any consolation, we're not alone with these exceptional rainfall totals. A succession of storms has battered Iberia, with Storm Marta the latest to affect Portugal, Spain and Gibraltar this weekend, following on a very wet January which saw some places receive three times the normal rainfall. \"Unfortunately, there's no end in sight,\" said Dan Stroud, operational meteorologist with the Met Office.

The party said it had received advice that a 2023 probe into accusations made by four women was \"flawed in several respects\". Lib Dem leader, Sir Ed Davey, believes he should not be a member of the House of Lords. Lord Rennard, a former chief executive of the party, pointed to a number of investigations, by police and lawyers, which had not resulted in any findings of wrongdoing. Three of the women in the original claim said the latest move by the Liberal Democrats was \"the first signs of change\". 'We did not expect a fair investigation to take so long' The joint statement by Alison Smith, Bridget Harris and Alison Goldsworthy said: \"We decided to speak out in 2013 so that future generations of women could participate in politics safely. \"We did not expect a fair investigation to take so long and hope that the next steps will finally put the matter to rest.\" A spokeswoman for the Lib Dems said: \"Rennard has had the Liberal Democrat whip in the House of Lords and his party membership suspended, and the party is conducting a new investigation into these allegations. \"The party has now received legal advice that the 2013 investigation into allegations against Rennard was flawed in several respects. \"Ed Davey has made clear he believes Rennard should not be a member of the House of Lords and that it should be made easier for peers to be expelled from the Lords for serious misconduct.\" A review carried out in 2013, by senior lawyer Alistair Webster, concluded there was a less than 50% chance of the case against Lord Rennard being proved beyond reasonable doubt. But in a statement summarising his findings, Mr Webster added there was \"broadly credible\" evidence of \"behaviour which violated the personal space and autonomy of the complainants\". What has the peer said? Responding to the latest suspension, Lord Rennard said: \"All allegations made against me were investigated by the Metropolitan Police Service in 2013 in what was acknowledged by one of the complainants to be a 'thorough and professional investigation'. \"After interviewing all concerned and considering any evidence they decided not to send a file to the Crown Prosecution Service and took no further action. \"A thorough investigation of all allegations was then undertaken by an independent lawyer, Alistair Webster KC, following very extensive appeals for any complaints concerning me and any evidence. \"His report submitted to the party in December 2013 concluded that there was insufficient evidence to hold a disciplinary hearing.\" Lord Rennard added: \"The report he submitted did not include the word 'credible'. His report was accepted by the relevant party body in January 2014. \"A further investigation was conducted by another independent lawyer as to whether there were any grounds at all for any form of disciplinary action against me and it concluded that there were not. \"This conclusion was accepted by the party in August 2014 when all disciplinary action against me ended.\""

        "Content": "\n          West of England and Wales correspondent\n              @danwnews\n The Welsh Parliament stands in what was known as Tiger Bay - a multicultural melting pot during the 18-1900s, home to around 50 nationalities working the docks. The area remains diverse. Outside Togayo Cafe we get chatting to Somali-born friends Omar Mohammad and Abdiqadir Mohamoud, who settled in Cardiff in the 90s and early 2000s. \"They talk about immigration like every immigrant that comes here is a bad immigrant,\" Omar tells me - as we discuss the opinion-poll rise of Reform UK in Wales. The latest one puts Nigel Farage's party second behind Plaid Cymru, with Greens third and the long-dominant Labour battling for fourth place with the Conservatives. If it's right, it'll be a political earthquake for a country that has been led by Labour since devolution began - and long before that. \"We're immigrants, we're working, we pay our taxes, and most of the people who come here want a better life. They're not here to destroy this country, they're just here to make their families better.\" \n                  Labour MPs urge Starmer to reveal if he saw peer's warnings about Mandelson's Epstein links\n                 \n                  Starmer branded 'weak' over Mandelson saga - as top Labour figure warns it could bring him down\n                 \n                  Trump grudgingly supports Starmer's Chagos deal\n                 He says he'll vote Labour - and definitely not Reform: \"Because that'll be the last time I'm here then - I'll probably be sent back, sent back!\" But Abdiqadir feels the immigration debate has been blown out of proportion. \"They are fuelling the people who are against immigrants - that is a problem. I think there is an exaggeration in immigration in this country.\" 'Labour promised so much' Forty-five minutes north into the heart of the Welsh Valleys - and you reach the Gurnos Estate in Merthyr Tydfil. Nearly two years ago, Reform leader Nigel Farage came here; it is one of the most deprived areas of Wales. He was launching his 'contract' with the British people - and chose the estate as an example of what he believes are failures by decades of Labour governance in Wales. Friends John Hobby and Peter James are Merthyr born and bred. I ask them if they feel it's time for change. \"It's got to be time for change, isn't it? It can't get any worse. It's got to get better,\" says Peter. \"People of Merthyr voted these people in. And for me they're not doing anything for the people of Merthyr.\" John reveals he'll vote Plaid. \"Because I got no trust in Labour. Because they're not looking after the country - they're bringing people in who's not supposed to be here, taking money from people who are working and people on benefits - taking money from them and giving it to them and giving them houses and God knows what man - not giving us nothing.\" There is disillusionment here - but not just with Labour in Wales. U-turns in Westminster are on people's minds as they prepare to vote. \"Keir Starmer definitely impacts the way I vote in Wales,\" Kevin Williams tells me. He says Labour in Westminster has been a \"disappointment\" and he's lost faith in the party. \"With Reform, they seem to have conviction. The Labour government doesn't seem to have any convictions. He seems to be a weak prime minister. \"Labour promised so much, they were so encouraging, but they haven't kept any of their promises. Not one.\" 'I think we're looking for another identity' This is a post-industrial land - where political loyalty is up for grabs. But party allegiance is not what it once was, according to former miner Ceri Thompson, now a curator at the Big Pit Museum in Torfaen. \"It's often difficult to think back to this, how powerful the trade union was and with that, then the politics and people actually believed, I think, perhaps more in politics than they do today,\" he says. \"I think we're looking for another identity because the identity was all about coal-tips, rugby clubs, headgears, coal, singing miners, and it's got to change. I've noticed more of a Welshness creeping in.\" In the very north of Wales - on the island of Anglesey - is the political home of Rhun ap Iorwerth, Plaid Cymru's leader, who hopes to become the next first minister of Wales. Helen Holland has been a teacher in Llangefni, a town near the centre of the island, for 38 years. She's a Plaid supporter who says Welsh identity and language is hugely important in this election. \"Well goodness me, that is what we are. We are Welsh and everything about us. \"Our language is part of our heritage and why can't we do things in our own language like the French or the Spanish... then hopefully we have a chance that the language will continue with our children.\" Does she feel it is dying sometimes? \"Of course it is.\" There is a problem in Wales when it comes to young people leaving - census data shows more than half of the country's local authorities lost more people aged between 18 and 29 years old than they gained. A lack of industry and jobs is noticed by 38-year-old chief Adam Hughes. \"A lot of my friends have moved away. A lot of my close friends have moved to Australia. I got friends that went to university, got degrees, came back, couldn't get work so have to emigrate abroad again. Unless you've got a solid trade, jobs are scarce around here.\" He seems disillusioned - and admits he probably won't vote in May. \"From what I can see the end result is the same, particularly not here, maybe some parts of the country, but in North Wales, where I live here, I never see any change that affects our lives - so why bother is my general opinion.\" Back in the Valleys - and there is fresh hope among the next generation. Scott James' great-grandfather was a miner - now he has set up the Coaltown Coffee company in the town of Ammanford. They have two branches and sell into Selfridges. \"Our ethos here is to prove a point. It's trying to prove that anything can be done in the post-industrial towns - they shouldn't be forgotten about.\" He says it's \"really important\" to retain as much talent as possible.

For new mum Lauren from Cardiff, the NHS is her priority, with waiting lists remaining among the highest in the UK. \"I just think obviously health needs some more money invested into it, reduced waiting times for patients, access to GP appointments as well. \"I always vote, with the hope something is going to change. But I'm a bit pessimistic that anything will actually change. \"It would be nice, wouldn't it, to vote for a party and they actually follow through with the plans which they said they were going to put in place.\" Peer into the Senedd building in Cardiff Bay and you can see the millions of pounds worth of building work under way to accommodate an extra 36 members of parliament being elected this May. Who'll take the most seats - what the shape of power will be - is all to be decided."

Officers in riot gear and with shields confronted about 100 protesters, some of whom wore hoods and scarves to cover their faces, after they broke away from a main demonstration and appeared to be trying to reach the Santagiulia Olympic ice hockey rink. A group of protesters also set off smoke bombs and firecrackers about half a mile (800 metres) from the Olympic Village, where around 1,500 athletes are staying. Six people were arrested during the altercation, according to police sources.

        "Content": "\n          Asia correspondent\n              @HelenAnnSmith0\n Japanese politics is politer and more understated than most. It's perhaps the reason that Western audiences do not always pay a huge amount of attention. But something feels different this time, and that's largely down to the woman at the centre of this story; the drum-playing, Trump-hugging, China-provoking prime minister who has raised the stakes for both Japan and the region. In central Tokyo, just a few hours before polls opened in the snap election she called, hundreds of people crowded into a small local park to see Sanae Takaichi. Despite the bitterly cold temperatures and the fact that many struggled to see her over the sea of heads, there was a sense that something significant was unfolding. \"I was just passing,\" one woman told me, \"but I couldn't not stop to see her!\" There is no disputing the fact that Takaichi is just different to those who have gone before her. She's a former heavy metal drummer and motorbike rider, and she is happy to jump around the stage at rallies and sing to visiting foreign leaders (Italy's Giorgia Meloni was greeted with a rousing happy birthday). Her outsized character in a scene historically so male and so dry has led to soaring personal approval ratings, 2.6 million followers on X and a one-year wait to buy her signature black handbag. Not to mention the reversal of fortunes seen by her struggling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP): it now looks set to take a majority in Japan's Lower House, just four months after she assumed the leadership in the wake of her unpopular predecessor's resignation. Read more: Can Japan's first female PM tighten her grip on power? Japan's 'Iron Lady' will pursue conservative vision if she wins But she's also far from the liberal champion many might have hoped for in the country's first female leader; she is, in fact, ultra conservative. She's anti gay marriage and a vocal defender of traditional gender roles; she sees Margaret Thatcher as a role model and has leant into a rising feeling of \"foreigner fatigue\" in Japan, directed both at immigrants and tourists. If she secures her own mandate at Sunday's election, it is this conservative vision that she will be pursuing. 'She's like a friendly neighbour or sister' In her hometown of Nara, they think that is a good thing. Here, a small minivan has been converted into a \"battle bus\" of sorts, and her dedicated team of supporters are driving it around the traditional streets, asking locals to sign it, calling her name through the megaphones and asking for their votes. \"She's like a friendly neighbour or sister,\" one old man tells us as he remembers her starting out in politics. 'She is simply doing what is necessary to protect Japan' When I ask one of her team what he makes of her conservative views, he simply responds: \"Rather than labelling it conservatism, I think she is simply doing what is necessary to protect Japan.\" Of course, in any election, domestic policy is a focus; she favours tax cuts and increased public spending to boost a sluggish economy. But the area of her policy that has brought the most attention and the most ire has been her approach to foreign policy and, particularly, her approach to China. Support from Trump According to its constitution, Japan is still a pacifist country, and it has thus long relied on the US for its security. Takaichi has made a particular point of cosying up to Donald Trump's America; his visit to Japan last year was notable for the excess of its warmth, and Trump has actively endorsed her campaign. But she has also been highly hawkish in her attitudes to Japan's largest and most powerful neighbour. The two were already set to be at odds; Takaichi's plan to spend more on and build up Japan's military is a deeply sore point in China, which suffered enormously at its hands during the Second World War. Read more from Sky News:Trump says he didn't make a mistake over Obamas as apes videoOver 80 flood warnings issued in UK as more downpours expected Mixed feelings about standing up to China But things plunged to a new low in November when she said that a Chinese attack on the island of Taiwan (a self-governing democracy that China sees as a breakaway province) would amount to an \"existential threat\" to Japan, and it would have the right to intervene militarily. The comments have caused outrage in China, drawing a raft of damaging retaliations, from the banning of the imports of Japanese seafood to restrictions on its access to crucial rare metals and a pointed suggestion that Chinese travellers should avoid it. Relations are at their lowest ebb for over a decade, and while some Japanese are happy to see their leader stand up to China, others are anxious. \"Seeing China imposing economic sanctions, it proves how thoughtless her remarks were,\" one man at her rally tells me. \"It's definitely more dangerous.\" The reality is that for all the Instagrammable moments, Takaichi's stance on China might well be the key issue that plagues and potentially even defines her leadership; it is not a disagreement that the Chinese will just let go. Japan's lean to the right under a Takaichi-style nationalism might well bring a renewed sense of pride to some, but it could also bring a new jeopardy to all."

        "Content": "Cristiano Ronaldo has missed a second straight game with Saudi Pro League side Al Nassr as he continues his strike. Ronaldo, 41, returned to training this week but was not in the matchday squad named by boss Jorge Jesus. The Portuguese forward missed his side's game against Al Riyadh on Monday but football officials had hoped he would play against Al Ittihad on Friday. According to Sky Sports News, officials felt Friday's fixture would be too big to miss and believe his strike is harming the image of the Saudi Pro League (SPL). It is further reported the five-time Ballon d'Or winner feels his side are not being backed financially as much as their title rivals Al Hilal. Both clubs are owned by The Public Investment Fund (PIF), Saudi Arabia's sovereign wealth fund. Al Nassr recorded their second successive victory without Ronaldo, beating Al Ittihad by 2-0 thanks to goals from Sadio Mane and Angelo Gabriel. They now lie second in the SPL, one point behind Al Hilal. Ronaldo is earning a reported £500,000 a day in the Middle East and has 18 months remaining on his deal.

'No individual determines decisions beyond their club' A spokesperson for the SPL said: \"The Saudi Pro League is structured around a simple principle: every club operates independently under the same rules. \"Clubs have their own boards, their own executives and their own football leadership. Decisions on recruitment, spending and strategy sit with those clubs, within a financial framework designed to ensure sustainability and competitive balance. That framework applies equally across the league. \"Cristiano has been fully engaged with Al Nassr since his arrival and has played an important role in the club's growth and ambition. Like any elite competitor, he wants to win. But no individual - however significant - determines decisions beyond their own club.\" They added: \"Recent transfer activity demonstrates that independence clearly. One club strengthened in a particular way. Another chose a different approach. Those were club decisions, taken within approved financial parameters. \"The competitiveness of the league speaks for itself. With only a few points separating the top four, the title race is very much alive. That level of balance reflects a system that is working as intended. \"The focus remains on football - on the pitch, where it belongs - and on maintaining a credible, competitive competition for players and fans.\""

On Thursday, the White House press secretary, Karoline Leavitt, told reporters: \"While these negotiations are taking place, I would remind the Iranian regime that the president has many options at ​his disposal, aside from diplomacy as the commander in chief of the most powerful military in the history of the world.\" A regional diplomat who had been briefed by Iran told Reuters news agency that Iran insisted on its \"right to enrich uranium\" during the negotiations. \n                  Iran and US to begin high-stakes talks amid fears of conflict\n                 \n                  After the crackdown: what is happening on the streets of Iran? \n                 \n                  Is Donald Trump about to defy the US Constitution?\n                 The diplomat also said Iran's missile capabilities were not raised in the discussions. Iranian officials ruled out putting the country's missiles, which make up one of the largest missile arsenals in the Middle East, up for discussion. Iran also wants recognition of its right to enrich uranium. \"The prime minister believes that any negotiations must include limiting ballistic missiles and halting support ​for the Iranian axis,\" said the office of Mr Netanyahu, in a statement."

The Sudan Doctors Network said the strike was carried out by the paramilitary group Rapid Support Forces (RSF) on a vehicle carrying displaced families on Saturday. Among the dead were two infants, and several others were wounded. It happened close to the city of Rahad, in North Kordofan province, which suffers from a severe medical supplies shortage. The vehicle had been carrying the displaced families who had fled fighting in the Dubeiker area. It comes a day after a World Food Program aid convoy was targeted, killing one and wounding several others. 'Take immediate action' The doctors' group urged the international community and rights organisations to \"take immediate action to protect civilians and hold the RSF leadership directly accountable for these violations\". There was no immediate comment from the RSF, which has been at war against the Sudanese military for control of the country for around three years.

        "Content": "\n          Sports correspondent\n              @RobHarris\n For a largely sedate and elegant spectacle, the Winter Olympics opening ceremony still became an outlet for rage in Milan. Pleas from International Olympic Committee (IOC) president Kirsty Coventry to be respectful were ignored when four Israelis entered the San Siro in the athlete parade. You had to listen carefully, but boos could be heard over the music in the vast stadium. Simultaneous parades were held at Games clusters across northern Italy - while jeering was reported in Predazzo, there were cheers when Israelis marched in the mountain resort of Cortina d'Ampezzo. Israel has endured more harrowing days at the Olympics, with 11 of their athletes murdered by Palestinian terrorists in a massacre at Munich in 1972. For these Olympics, the IOC faced pressure to ban Israel from competing over the thousands killed in the post-7 October war in Gaza, but rejected those calls. The jeering demonstrated the animosity of some in the crowd towards the Jewish state, with hostility over conflict and geopolitical tensions hard to escape in the ceremony. \n                  Italian police fire tear gas at protesters near Olympics venue\n                 \n                  In pictures: The Winter Olympics opening day\n                 \n                  Crotch enhancements: The latest controversy at the Winter Olympics\n                 Read more: Follow all the updates from the Winter Olympics in Italy Fractures between Europe and the United States were also evident. While American athletes entered to cheers, the brief appearance of vice president JD Vance, waving Stars and Stripes flags with wife, Usha, did prompt more booing and whistling. Anger against the Trump administration has been evident in the buildup to the Games, with protests against Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents being here to protect the US delegation, weeks after their personnel killed two American citizens. But if you were watching on television, you probably didn't hear the booing - drowned out by music or commentators. Italians will have revelled in hearing Mariah Carey paying homage to the hosts by singing iconic 1950s hit Volare in Italian. Maybe you did hear the cheers for Ukraine, a show of solidarity four years into the full-scale invasion by Russia, whose team remains banned. There were enthusiastic roars, too, for Venezuela following Trump's military interventions. The IOC wanted to show a world uniting through sport, hoping these Games are a platform for compassion to shine rather than conflict. \"You'll show us that strength isn't just about winning,\" Ms Coventry told athletes in her address. \"It's about courage, empathy and heart.\" Read more from Sky News:Here's what we've found in Epstein filesNigerian court orders UK to pay £420m It is about a vast Olympics.

It is an even wider platform-to-platform. But Ms Coventry told her first opening ceremony leading the Olympics that \"when we see rivals embrace at the finish line, we are reminded that we can choose respect\"."

        "Content": "Japan is holding a snap election on Sunday, in the first electoral test for the country's first female prime minister, Sanae Takaichi, since she became leader.  Her Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) is projected to win a decisive mandate, thanks to the \"sanamania\" among younger voters who idolise the 64-year-old leader, her favourite pink pen and her rice cracker snacks. A recent poll suggests about 90% of voters under 30 support Ms Takaichi, while her overall popularity stands at around 60%. Her personal approval ratings are almost double that of her party, according to a new poll by public broadcaster NHK. Known for being ultra-conservative on social issues such as gender and sexual diversity, Ms Takaichi hopes to win back voters who flocked to emerging populist parties in recent elections. So who is the PM, why is she so popular, and what has she done to enflame tensions with China? Japan's 'Iron Lady' A protege of late prime minister Shinzo Abe, Ms Takaichi was elected by the LDP as their new leader in October, making her country's first female prime minister, leading a governing coalition with the right-wing Japan Innovation Party (JIP). \n                  Japan's drum-playing, Trump-hugging, China-provoking PM Sanae Takaichi raises the stakes\n                 \n                  At least 35 killed after weeks of heavy snowfall in Japan\n                 \n                  Pokémon apologises after Chinese anger over plan for game at Japanese shrine\n                 The presidential election came after her LDP predecessor, Shigeru Ishiba, was forced to step down due to significant losses in the 2024 lower house and 2025 upper house elections. Analysts said the LDP's failed economic policies and political corruption were behind the loss in voter support. This was her third bid for leadership of the LDP, after attempts in 2024 and 2021. Read more from Sky News:Winter Olympics under way with opening ceremonyMystery as Russian general shot at close range During her most recent campaign, Ms Takaichi, whose mother was a police officer and father worked at a car company, said she wanted to become the \"Iron Lady\" - a homage to Margaret Thatcher, the daughter of a Grantham grocer who became Britain's first female prime minister. Ms Takaichi was first elected to parliament as an independent in 1993 to represent the constituency that includes her hometown of Nara, before briefly joining the liberal New Frontier Party in 1994 and then moving to the LDP, when it won the general election in 1996. She has taken on several roles within her party and in government over the last three decades, including minister of economic security, internal affairs, and gender equality. What are her politics? Ms Takaichi has called for a stronger military, more fiscal spending for growth, promotion of nuclear fusion, cybersecurity and tougher policies on immigration. She supports the imperial family's male-only succession and opposes same-sex marriage and a law allowing wives to have separate surnames from their husbands. The new prime minister has stuck with old-fashioned views favoured by male LDP heavyweights, backing financial support for women's health and fertility treatments as part of her party's policy of having women serve in traditional roles of being good mothers and wives. But she also recently talked about her struggles with menopausal symptoms and stressed the need to educate men about female health to help women at school and work. Ms Takaichi is a wartime history revisionist and China hawk who recently enflamed tensions with Beijing over her remarks on Taiwan. In November, she appeared to suggest that Japan could become involved if China takes military action against Taiwan, a self-governing island Beijing considers part of its territory, as this would qualify as \"an existential threat\". In retaliation, China increased economic and diplomatic retribution. Endorsed by Trump and friends with Meloni US President Donald Trump who is trying to maintain a fragile trade truce with China, asked Ms Takaichi not to further aggravate Beijing in a private phone call in November, sources told Reuters. But he had already endorsed her leadership during his visit to Japan in October. He said he was looking forward to hosting her at the White House in March after lauding Ms Takaichi for breaking Japan's glass ceiling. She appears to have found a political best friend in fellow right-wing populist Giorgia Meloni after singing happy birthday to the Italian prime minister and presenting her with cake and gifts during a meeting in Tokyo last month. The women snapped a selfie together - with Ms Meloni later posting an anime version next to the caption: \"Two distant nations, but ever closer. Friendship and harmony.\" The pair shared a long hug as they said goodbye, with the Italian prime minister telling her Japanese counterpart: \"Count always on me, okay? For whatever you need. I know it's not easy but we'll do it together.\" Why is she so popular with young voters? A drummer in a heavy-metal band and a motorbike rider as a student, Ms Takaichi has built a large social media following that tops any of her rivals, with 2.6 million followers on X compared to about 64,000 for Yoshihiko Noda, the leader of Japan's main opposition party. Many of her posts have gone viral, including clips of her drumming to the hit song Golden from Netflix's K-Pop Demon Hunters film alongside South Korean President Lee Jae-myung, or her serenading Ms Meloni. Her upbeat image has earned her strong approval ratings. \"She has a clear, decisive way of speaking,\" Takeo Fujimura, a 24-year-old clerical worker, said. \"She communicates in a bright, positive way and I think that energy resonates with young people.\" Her personal style has also been praised by fans, who rushed to snap up the £660 black leather bag Ms Takaichi regularly carries, causing a nine-month backlog at the brand Hamano. There is a similar hype around the pink ballpoint pen she uses for note taking in parliament and the shrimp rice crackers she has been spotted holding while travelling by train. But some analysts question whether enough young people will actually go and vote for Ms Takaichi, as younger people have historically been less likely to vote than older generations that had helped the LDP to a near-unbroken post-war rule in Japan but are not the guarantee of power they once were. Why has she called an election? Ms Takaichi's call for this month's snap election in January has been seen as an attempt to capitalise on her strong approval ratings of around 70% to help her beleaguered governing party gain more seats. Polls show that the LDP could capture around 300 seats in the 465-seat lower house - the more powerful of the parliamentary chambers. This would be a major improvement on the current razor-thin majority the LDP and its coalition partner JIP have in the lower house after losing many seats in 2024 and being defeated in the upper house election last July. The LDP and JIP are hoping they can secure a supermajority of more than two-thirds, which would give Ms Takashi's coalition the ability to push through legislation even if it doesn't secure enough votes in the upper house. In December, Ms Takichi's cabinet approved a record 122.3 trillion yen (£565 billion) budget that needs parliamentary approval before the upcoming fiscal year starting April to fund measures to fight inflation, support low-income households and projects to help economic growth. Winning the election would help her pass this budget after opposition leaders criticised her for delaying it with the snap election. Polling and media reports suggest that some voters have not been convinced by Ms Takaichi and her party, as her promised fiscal largesse has been partly credited for the yen sliding. But opposition groups in Japan are seen as too splintered to win an election, with several polls putting Ms Takaichi's party and coalition partner firmly in the lead."

Nancy Guthrie, whose daughter is NBC's Today show co-host Savannah Guthrie, is feared to have been kidnapped. The 84-year-old was last seen at her own home near Tucson, Arizona, on the evening of Saturday 31 January, with a local TV station since receiving two messages that appear to be connected to the case. One demanded money in exchange for her return and contained information about her Apple watch and floodlights on her property. On Friday, a spokesperson for the convenience store chain Circle K told NBC News, Sky News's US partner, that officers visited one of their stores after \"receiving a tip regarding a vehicle of interest, and our team has provided them access to the store's surveillance video\". Officials have not said whether the vehicle or vehicles are connected to any part of the disappearance. It comes as the FBI and Pima County Sheriff's Department said they were aware of a \"new message regarding Nancy Guthrie\". It was not clear what the message was or if it was connected to previously reported notes. The message was sent to Tucson TV station KOLD, three officials briefed on the meeting told NBC News. The FBI is working to confirm if it came from the same sender as the first reported ransom note, the sources said. They stressed that the FBI has not yet verified if the first note came from someone who may have taken Ms Guthrie from her home. Ms Guthrie's children have released two videos appealing to her apparent kidnappers. On Wednesday, Savannah Guthrie posted a video in which she tearfully pleaded for her mother's safe return and appealed to the presumed kidnappers to open a line of communication with the family.

City sources said that NatWest was expected to pay between £2.5bn and £3bn to buy Evelyn, which offers a broad range of wealth management services to thousands of customers. An announcement confirming the deal could come in the early part of next week. Buying Evelyn, which was previously known as Tilney Smith & Williamson, will strengthen NatWest's presence in one of the areas identified by Paul Thwaite, its chief executive, as a priority for the bank. NatWest, which is expected to report strong full-year results at the end of next week, has embarked on a simplification drive since Mr Thwaite took over in 2023. Analysts said that buying Evelyn would represent a logical strategic move for NatWest's Coutts arm as well as its affluent customer segment. Although it is a sizeable deal, a price of under £3bn is modest in the context of NatWest's market capitalisation of almost £52bn. Its shares have risen by close to 50% during the last year.

Royal Bank of Canada had been linked to a bid, although it was unclear whether it formally tabled an offer this week. Evelyn had close to £65bn in assets under management as of last August, when it reported half-year results, making it a significant player in the sector in the UK. The auction of Evelyn comes amid a torrent of corporate activity in the wealth management sector. Demographics and the drive to push Britons into longer-term saving, investment and financial planning have driven growth across large parts of the industry in recent years - a trend which is expected to continue. Canaccord Genuity's wealth arm is also on the block and could fetch a price of over £1bn. Acquiring Evelyn will also trigger a return to NatWest for Evelyn's chief executive, Paul Geddes, if he remains involved with the business. Mr Geddes joined the then Royal Bank of Scotland before the financial crisis, running its insurance arm, which included brands such as Direct Line and Churchill. He oversaw its spinoff from the high street lender, which at the time was under majority government ownership. Evelyn is owned by the private equity firms Permira and Warburg Pincus, having merged their respective firms Tilney and Smith & Williamson in 2020. Last year, Evelyn's professional services arm was sold to the buyout firm Apax Partners. The auction of the wealth management business is being handled by bankers at Evercore. NatWest and Barclays both declined to comment, while Permira has been contacted for comment."

The peer lost his role in September last year over his relationship with paedophile financier Jeffrey Epstein, just seven months into the job. However, anger in Westminster has grown after the last release of documents, which indicated he leaked information to his friend while he was a government minister. Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer's allies have said he should give the taxpayer-funded handout, which could run into the tens of thousands, back or donate it to a victims' charity. \"Given what we know now, Mandelson should either pay the money back or give it to a charity to support victims,\" a Downing Street source said. The Foreign Office said a review had been launched \"in light of further information that has now been revealed\".

Full details of the payoff are set to be revealed in parliament after MPs backed a call for the papers relating to his time in government to be disclosed. The Sunday Times suggests it could be between £38,750 and £55,000, which is based on a three-month payoff of the highest annual salary in the diplomatic service between £155,000 and £220,000. A Foreign Office spokesman said: \"Peter Mandelson's civil service employment was terminated in September 2025 in accordance with legal advice and the terms and conditions of his employment. \"Normal civil service HR processes were followed.

Lord Mandelson, his ex-business secretary, has been accused of sharing market-sensitive information with the US sex offender after the 2008 global financial crisis. Mr Brown has since been asked about how he felt about his former colleague's behaviour, to which he replied he was \"shocked, sad, angry, betrayed, let down\". \"All of the information he passed on... the papers by other advisers were commercially sensitive; this was financially secret information,\" Mr Brown said. \"It meant that Britain was at risk because of that, the currency was at risk, some of the trading that would happen would be speculative as a result of that. \"There's no doubt that huge commercial damage could have been done and perhaps was done.\" On Saturday afternoon, a top corporate and financial crime lawyer visited Lord Mandelson's house near Regent's Park, London. \n                  We've combed through thousands of pages, photos and videos - here's what we've found in Epstein files\n                 \n                  Norway's crown princess Mette-Marit apologises over Epstein links\n                 \n                  Can Starmer survive the Mandelson scandal? \n                 Adrian Darbishire KC arrived at the property shortly before midday, before leaving around 90 minutes later.

The Metropolitan Police said the criminal investigation is \"complex\" and will require a \"significant amount of further evidence gathering and analysis\". Mr Brown spoke after emails released as part of the Epstein files revealed the correspondence between Lord Mandelson and the paedophile financier. In the messages, the former Labour peer appears to brief Epstein on internal discussions at the heart of UK government, including giving him advance notice of a €500bn EU bank bailout in 2010. He also told him he was \"trying hard\" to change government policy on bankers' bonuses. The then chancellor Alistair Darling announced a 50% \"super tax\" on bonuses in December 2009, in a bid to prevent pay being inflated by taxpayer-funded bailouts. The documents further suggest that Epstein sent money to Lord Mandelson and his partner, Reinaldo Avila da Silva. Lord Mandelson twice resigned from government amid controversy under Tony Blair, before Mr Brown brought him back into the cabinet. \"I made mistakes, I regret it, it shouldn't have happened,\" Mr Brown said. He said he and his colleagues had been betrayed by Lord Mandelson. But, he added, \"the biggest betrayal was of the women and girls that were trafficked, that were exploited, that were treated as less than human\". He said Sir Keir Starmer had likewise made a mistake by appointing Lord Mandelson as Britain's ambassador to the US last year. \"Keir Starmer was misled and he was betrayed,\" Mr Brown said. \"He has clearly said it was the wrong decision, and it was the wrong decision. Just as I made a mistake, he made a mistake.\" But the ex-prime minister also hailed the current one as a man of \"integrity\". He blamed a \"systemic failure\" in vetting for Lord Mandelson's appointment. \"Mandelson, of course, did appear... to have an unblemished record as the trade commissioner for four years,\" he said. \"Nobody had ever heard of Epstein in the government, and nobody knew of any friendship between Epstein and Mandelson at that time.\" Read more:What do the Epstein files say about Lord Peter Mandelson?Police search Peter Mandelson's properties A government spokesperson said: \"The shameful and disgraceful behaviour revealed this week is wholly incompatible with public service, and it is right that no one is above accountability...

Many Labour MPs blame Mr McSweeney for the decision to appoint Lord Mandelson. He told Sky News: \"If the prime minister doesn't get rid of Mr McSweeney, he's lost the confidence of the PLP, it's as simple as that, I don't want it to be the case but it's true.\" He said before that: \"This prime minister would do well to listen to Gordon Brown. I think Gordon Brown should be brought in, actually, to sort out this mess and come up with a plan to clean politics up. \"I think that is something that Gordon would be willing to do, I think the prime minister ought to use him in that regard.\""

        "Content": "\n          West of England and Wales correspondent\n              @danwnews\n The Welsh Parliament stands in what was known as Tiger Bay - a multicultural melting pot during the 18-1900s, home to around 50 nationalities working the docks. The area remains diverse. Outside Togayo Cafe we get chatting to Somali-born friends Omar Mohammad and Abdiqadir Mohamoud, who settled in Cardiff in the 90s and early 2000s. \"They talk about immigration like every immigrant that comes here is a bad immigrant,\" Omar tells me - as we discuss the opinion-poll rise of Reform UK in Wales. The latest one puts Nigel Farage's party second behind Plaid Cymru, with Greens third and the long-dominant Labour battling for fourth place with the Conservatives. If it's right, it'll be a political earthquake for a country that has been led by Labour since devolution began - and long before that. \"We're immigrants, we're working, we pay our taxes, and most of the people who come here want a better life. They're not here to destroy this country, they're just here to make their families better.\" \n                  Labour MPs urge Starmer to reveal if he saw peer's warnings about Mandelson's Epstein links\n                 \n                  Starmer branded 'weak' over Mandelson saga - as top Labour figure warns it could bring him down\n                 \n                  Trump grudgingly supports Starmer's Chagos deal\n                 He says he'll vote Labour - and definitely not Reform: \"Because that'll be the last time I'm here then - I'll probably be sent back, sent back!\" But Abdiqadir feels the immigration debate has been blown out of proportion. \"They are fuelling the people who are against immigrants - that is a problem. I think there is an exaggeration in immigration in this country.\" 'Labour promised so much' Forty-five minutes north into the heart of the Welsh Valleys - and you reach the Gurnos Estate in Merthyr Tydfil. Nearly two years ago, Reform leader Nigel Farage came here; it is one of the most deprived areas of Wales. He was launching his 'contract' with the British people - and chose the estate as an example of what he believes are failures by decades of Labour governance in Wales. Friends John Hobby and Peter James are Merthyr born and bred. I ask them if they feel it's time for change. \"It's got to be time for change, isn't it? It can't get any worse. It's got to get better,\" says Peter. \"People of Merthyr voted these people in. And for me they're not doing anything for the people of Merthyr.\" John reveals he'll vote Plaid. \"Because I got no trust in Labour. Because they're not looking after the country - they're bringing people in who's not supposed to be here, taking money from people who are working and people on benefits - taking money from them and giving it to them and giving them houses and God knows what man - not giving us nothing.\" There is disillusionment here - but not just with Labour in Wales. U-turns in Westminster are on people's minds as they prepare to vote. \"Keir Starmer definitely impacts the way I vote in Wales,\" Kevin Williams tells me. He says Labour in Westminster has been a \"disappointment\" and he's lost faith in the party. \"With Reform, they seem to have conviction. The Labour government doesn't seem to have any convictions. He seems to be a weak prime minister. \"Labour promised so much, they were so encouraging, but they haven't kept any of their promises. Not one.\" 'I think we're looking for another identity' This is a post-industrial land - where political loyalty is up for grabs. But party allegiance is not what it once was, according to former miner Ceri Thompson, now a curator at the Big Pit Museum in Torfaen. \"It's often difficult to think back to this, how powerful the trade union was and with that, then the politics and people actually believed, I think, perhaps more in politics than they do today,\" he says. \"I think we're looking for another identity because the identity was all about coal-tips, rugby clubs, headgears, coal, singing miners, and it's got to change. I've noticed more of a Welshness creeping in.\" In the very north of Wales - on the island of Anglesey - is the political home of Rhun ap Iorwerth, Plaid Cymru's leader, who hopes to become the next first minister of Wales. Helen Holland has been a teacher in Llangefni, a town near the centre of the island, for 38 years. She's a Plaid supporter who says Welsh identity and language is hugely important in this election. \"Well goodness me, that is what we are. We are Welsh and everything about us. \"Our language is part of our heritage and why can't we do things in our own language like the French or the Spanish... then hopefully we have a chance that the language will continue with our children.\" Does she feel it is dying sometimes? \"Of course it is.\" There is a problem in Wales when it comes to young people leaving - census data shows more than half of the country's local authorities lost more people aged between 18 and 29 years old than they gained. A lack of industry and jobs is noticed by 38-year-old chief Adam Hughes. \"A lot of my friends have moved away. A lot of my close friends have moved to Australia. I got friends that went to university, got degrees, came back, couldn't get work so have to emigrate abroad again. Unless you've got a solid trade, jobs are scarce around here.\" He seems disillusioned - and admits he probably won't vote in May. \"From what I can see the end result is the same, particularly not here, maybe some parts of the country, but in North Wales, where I live here, I never see any change that affects our lives - so why bother is my general opinion.\" Back in the Valleys - and there is fresh hope among the next generation. Scott James' great-grandfather was a miner - now he has set up the Coaltown Coffee company in the town of Ammanford. They have two branches and sell into Selfridges. \"Our ethos here is to prove a point. It's trying to prove that anything can be done in the post-industrial towns - they shouldn't be forgotten about.\" He says it's \"really important\" to retain as much talent as possible. Read more from Sky News:Suffolk strangler survivor: police treated me like a 'silly little girl'Move out of Westminster or face 60 years of repairs, MPs warned \"We have some phenomenal people, phenomenal education around this area... and to see them leave from where they're from, not because they're not happy living here, just because they're looking for opportunities, is really sad to see.\" 'I'm pessimistic that anything will actually change' This is no normal election for Wales - there are big changes coming; a reformed voting system, a change in constituencies and an increase in the number of politicians. For new mum Lauren from Cardiff, the NHS is her priority, with waiting lists remaining among the highest in the UK. \"I just think obviously health needs some more money invested into it, reduced waiting times for patients, access to GP appointments as well. \"I always vote, with the hope something is going to change. But I'm a bit pessimistic that anything will actually change. \"It would be nice, wouldn't it, to vote for a party and they actually follow through with the plans which they said they were going to put in place.\" Peer into the Senedd building in Cardiff Bay and you can see the millions of pounds worth of building work under way to accommodate an extra 36 members of parliament being elected this May. Who'll take the most seats - what the shape of power will be - is all to be decided."

The party said it had received advice that a 2023 probe into accusations made by four women was \"flawed in several respects\". Lib Dem leader, Sir Ed Davey, believes he should not be a member of the House of Lords. Lord Rennard, a former chief executive of the party, pointed to a number of investigations, by police and lawyers, which had not resulted in any findings of wrongdoing. Three of the women in the original claim said the latest move by the Liberal Democrats was \"the first signs of change\". 'We did not expect a fair investigation to take so long' The joint statement by Alison Smith, Bridget Harris and Alison Goldsworthy said: \"We decided to speak out in 2013 so that future generations of women could participate in politics safely. \"We did not expect a fair investigation to take so long and hope that the next steps will finally put the matter to rest.\" A spokeswoman for the Lib Dems said: \"Rennard has had the Liberal Democrat whip in the House of Lords and his party membership suspended, and the party is conducting a new investigation into these allegations. \"The party has now received legal advice that the 2013 investigation into allegations against Rennard was flawed in several respects. \"Ed Davey has made clear he believes Rennard should not be a member of the House of Lords and that it should be made easier for peers to be expelled from the Lords for serious misconduct.\" A review carried out in 2013, by senior lawyer Alistair Webster, concluded there was a less than 50% chance of the case against Lord Rennard being proved beyond reasonable doubt. But in a statement summarising his findings, Mr Webster added there was \"broadly credible\" evidence of \"behaviour which violated the personal space and autonomy of the complainants\". What has the peer said? Responding to the latest suspension, Lord Rennard said: \"All allegations made against me were investigated by the Metropolitan Police Service in 2013 in what was acknowledged by one of the complainants to be a 'thorough and professional investigation'. \"After interviewing all concerned and considering any evidence they decided not to send a file to the Crown Prosecution Service and took no further action. \"A thorough investigation of all allegations was then undertaken by an independent lawyer, Alistair Webster KC, following very extensive appeals for any complaints concerning me and any evidence. \"His report submitted to the party in December 2013 concluded that there was insufficient evidence to hold a disciplinary hearing.\" Lord Rennard added: \"The report he submitted did not include the word 'credible'. His report was accepted by the relevant party body in January 2014. \"A further investigation was conducted by another independent lawyer as to whether there were any grounds at all for any form of disciplinary action against me and it concluded that there were not. \"This conclusion was accepted by the party in August 2014 when all disciplinary action against me ended.\""

        "Content": "Police investigating the disappearance of a US TV host's mother are searching for a vehicle or vehicles that may be connected to her case. Nancy Guthrie, whose daughter is NBC's Today show co-host Savannah Guthrie, is feared to have been kidnapped. The 84-year-old was last seen at her own home near Tucson, Arizona, on the evening of Saturday 31 January, with a local TV station since receiving two messages that appear to be connected to the case. One demanded money in exchange for her return and contained information about her Apple watch and floodlights on her property. On Friday, a spokesperson for the convenience store chain Circle K told NBC News, Sky News's US partner, that officers visited one of their stores after \"receiving a tip regarding a vehicle of interest, and our team has provided them access to the store's surveillance video\". Officials have not said whether the vehicle or vehicles are connected to any part of the disappearance. It comes as the FBI and Pima County Sheriff's Department said they were aware of a \"new message regarding Nancy Guthrie\". It was not clear what the message was or if it was connected to previously reported notes. The message was sent to Tucson TV station KOLD, three officials briefed on the meeting told NBC News. The FBI is working to confirm if it came from the same sender as the first reported ransom note, the sources said. They stressed that the FBI has not yet verified if the first note came from someone who may have taken Ms Guthrie from her home. Ms Guthrie's children have released two videos appealing to her apparent kidnappers. On Wednesday, Savannah Guthrie posted a video in which she tearfully pleaded for her mother's safe return and appealed to the presumed kidnappers to open a line of communication with the family. On Thursday evening, her son Cameron Guthrie said in a video posted to his sister's Instagram account: \"Whoever is out there holding our mother, we want to hear from you.\" Read more:A neighbourhood left stunned by a crime that's mystifying USThree months until crucial Welsh elections US President Donald Trump, speaking to reporters on Air Force One, said late on Friday that the investigation into Ms Guthrie's disappearance was going \"very well\". \"We have some clues that I think are very strong,\" he added. \"We have some things that may be coming out reasonably soon.\" US attorney general Pam Bondi told reporters earlier on Friday that federal authorities were assisting Arizona officials, but she declined to offer details. \"It breaks my heart for Savannah and for her family,\" she added. Meanwhile, the sheriff investigating Ms Guthrie's disappearance said concern about her condition is growing because authorities say she needs daily medicine. Pima County Sheriff Chris Nanos said: \"Her conditions, I would imagine, are worsening day by day. \"She requires medication. And I have no way of knowing whether they're getting that medication to her.\" Ms Guthrie was said to have a pacemaker and dealt with high blood pressure and heart issues, according to the sheriff's dispatcher audio on broadcastify.com."

        "Content": "Police have caught a man juggling fire while riding a unicycle on a pedestrian crossing.  Footage shows the unicyclist performing on the pedestrian crossing at the intersection between US-85 and East 60th Avenue in Commerce City, Colorado. The man, wearing a red hat, blue trousers and a colourful jacket, can be seen driving forwards and backwards on the crossing, entertaining motorists waiting for the traffic light to turn green. He expertly balances on the unicycle, even lifting a leg at one point to balance on just one pedal, all while juggling three torches, before hopping off his vehicle and running out of the way of the waiting cars. \"Our drone caught his act, which was both quite good and quite illegal,\" the Commerce City Police Department wrote in a social media post. The force said the performance violated several laws, including trespassing and impeding traffic by failing to vacate the crossing in time. \"Let's all take a moment to appreciate this man's talents, then all agree that we aren't going to do stuff like this,\" officers warned in the post.
