        "Content": "\n          Crime correspondent\n              @skymartinbrunt\n Britain's most-wanted fugitive is still on the run - exactly 20 years after the fatal shooting of a young mother of three. Kevin Parle is a suspect in the murder of Lucy Hargreaves, 22, who was shot dead at her home in Liverpool before the house was set on fire on 3 August 2005. Since then, after many appeals for information, there has been no confirmed sighting, word or trace of him. Two decades on, Ms Hargreaves' family have had no justice. Two young men prosecuted for her murder had charges dropped when a judge ruled there was insufficient evidence against them. In a statement marking the anniversary of her death, they said: \"The way we lost Lucy is not something families can ever truly come to terms with - it is still incredibly difficult and painful to think about. \"Over the past 20 years, people will have talked with family and friends. A number of people were contacted by males using a phone that was stolen along with a vehicle used in Lucy's murder. \"We appeal directly to them to please come forward. Now is the time.\" Three men burst into Lucy's home 20 years ago today, shot her dead as she slept on a sofa, and set alight the duvet she'd been sleeping under. It's believed the gang were looking for her boyfriend Gary Campbell, who was upstairs. He fled from a window with their two-year-old daughter and then tried in vain to save Ms Hargreaves. Mr Campbell had allegedly been a passenger in a stolen car that had hit and killed a young boy 12 years earlier, supposedly the motive for the shooting. He denied he was in the car at the time. Howard Rubbery, head of the Serious Crime Review Unit at Merseyside Police said: \"The family remain absolutely devastated by Lucy's death. \"It's important to note Lucy is an absolutely innocent victim. She's not from a family of criminality. She wasn't involved in criminality. \"The hunt for Kevin Parle is very much on, and we ask anybody with information, anybody who is close to Parle and knows where he is, to please come forward. \"There were three males responsible for this offence and we are looking for justice for Lucy's family in relation to all three. \"I do believe that there are people out there who have yet to speak to the police, even though it's 20 years on, who hold information that's absolutely vital to our investigation.\" Police believe Parle, now in his 40s, fled to Spain where he hid among the vast expat community with criminal help. Several years later, I tracked his movements to a holiday complex near Torrevieja, where staff convinced me he had stayed there for several weeks. 'Huge value to organised crime' Former Scotland Yard detective Peter Bleksley, who recently spent four years on a personal hunt for Parle, also visited the complex and said: \"He was bold and he was brash and he had a girlfriend at one point. \"The police actually should have captured him there, but they were too late.\" He claimed he nearly caught up with Parle at a villa elsewhere in Spain, but spooked him into disappearing again. Mr Bleksley hosted an award-winning podcast and wrote a book in which he chronicled his manhunt. He said: \"Kevin Parle has remained hidden because he is funded, protected, looked after and of huge value to global, serious and organised crime.\" Parle can't be hard to spot - he's well-built, 6ft 5in tall, red-haired with a face scar and, originally at least, has a Liverpool accent. Of course, he might be dead. Mr Bleksley said: \"I can think of many reasons why certain criminals would want to get rid of Kevin Parle because he could, in terms of evidence about the cases that he's wanted for, should he flip and become a witness for the Crown, be highly damaging for a lot of very tasty criminals.\" Parle is also wanted in connection with the murder of 16-year-old Liam Kelly, who was shot dead over an alleged Â£200 debt in June 2004, a year before Lucy's death. Parle was arrested and questioned, but then freed on bail. There have been reports of the fugitive in Australia and Dubai, but nothing to corroborate any of them. If he's alive and if no one is prepared to shop him, what might lead to his capture? \"I think when he has a fallout with those who have guarded him, funded him, fed him, put a roof over his head and all of that, maybe even paid for his plastic surgery that could have altered his appearance,\" Mr Bleksley said. \"When he finally has a fallout, when he's no longer of use, then perhaps that will be the day that somebody goes, Peter, he's here.\""

        "Content": "Hamas has said it will not disarm unless an independent Palestinian state is established with Jerusalem as its capital. The militant group said it was issuing a statement \"in response to media reports quoting US envoy Steve Witkoff, claiming [Hamas] has shown willingness to disarm\". It continued: \"We reaffirm that resistance and its arms are a legitimate national and legal right as long as the occupation continues. \"This right is recognised by international laws and norms, and it cannot be relinquished except through the full restoration of our national rights - first and foremost, the establishment of an independent, fully sovereign Palestinian state with Jerusalem as its capital.\" Hamas also condemned Mr Witkoff's visit to an aid distribution centre in Gaza on Friday as \"nothing more than a premeditated staged show\". Donald Trump's Middle East envoy Mr Witkoff and Mike Huckabee, the US ambassador to Israel, visited a centre run by the controversial Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF).  Hamas said the trip was \"designed to mislead public opinion, polish the image of the occupation, and provide it with political cover for its starvation campaign and continued systematic killing of defenceless children and civilians in the Gaza Strip\". Mr Witkoff said he spent \"over five hours in Gaza\". In a post on X on Friday, he said: \"The purpose of the visit was to give [President Trump] a clear understanding of the humanitarian situation and help craft a plan to deliver food and medical aid to the people of Gaza.\" Elidalis Burges, a critical care nurse in Gaza, told Sky News she saw the US visit as a \"PR stunt\" and that the American officials were \"just being shown a small portion of what is actually happening\".  \"I think the visit to the GHF site was just a controlled visit dictated by the Israeli military,\" she said. \"If they really wanted people to see what is happening here, they would allow international journalists from around the world to enter. \"They would allow the leaders of the world to come here and see.\" Hamas releases hostage video It comes as Hamas released a video showing Israeli man, Evyatar David, being held hostage in what appears to be a tunnel.  Mr David was taken from the Nova Music Festival on 7 October 2023. His family have given permission for media outlets to show the video. More than a dozen killed by Israeli fire Gaza health officials have said 18 people, including eight who were trying to access food, were killed by Israeli fire on Saturday. Witness Yahia Youssef told Reuters news agency he helped carry three people wounded by gunshots and saw others lying on the ground near a food distribution centre. In response to questions about several eyewitness accounts of violence at one of its facilities, GHF said \"nothing [happened] at or near our sites\". The US and Israel-backed GHF has been marred by controversy and fatal shootings ever since it was set up earlier this year. According to the United Nations' human rights office, at least 859 people have been killed \"in the vicinity\" of GHF aid sites since late May. Read more:Doctor says colleague 'followed and killed by drone''Little confidence' in US officials seeing full picture Dr Tom Adamkiewicz, who is working at a hospital in Gaza, has said Palestinian children, women and men are \"being shot at, basically like rabbits\". It is a \"level of barbarity I don't think the world has seen\", he told Sky News. The Israel Defence Forces has repeatedly said it \"categorically rejects the claims of intentional harm to civilians\" and has blamed Hamas militants for fomenting chaos and endangering civilians.  The war in Gaza began when Hamas-led militants killed around 1,200 people, mostly civilians, in an attack on Israel on 7 October 2023 and abducted 251 others. Of those, they still hold around 50, with 20 believed to be alive, after most of the others were released in ceasefires or other deals. Israel's retaliatory offensive has killed more than 60,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry, which does not differentiate between militants and civilians in its count."

        "Headline": "India appeared to double down on Russian oil after Donald Trump criticised the relationship between the two major economies - as his frustration with Russian President Vladimir Putin mounts.",
        "Content": "By Victoria Seabrook, news reporter  India has indicated it will defy threats made by US President Donald Trump and continue buying Russian oil. The world's third-largest crude importer - after China and the US - cashed in on cheap Russian oil when its price plummeted after Vladimir Putin's full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Historically, it had bought most of its crude from countries in the Middle East. But this changed after the invasion in February 2022, when western countries slapped sanctions on Russia in a bid to choke off money fuelling Moscow's war chest.  It prompted the recent energy crisis that saw household bills in the UK soar. On Friday, the Indian foreign ministry said its relationship with Russia was \"steady and time-tested\", and warned against viewing it through the lens of another country. \n                  Trump orders two nuclear subs to be moved closer to Russia\n                 \n                  Trump ally calls for big tech 'united front' to fight UK and EU online safety laws\n                 \n                  Epstein abuse survivor Virginia Giuffre wanted files released, her family say\n                 Addressing a weekly meeting, spokesman Randhir Jaiswal said India's general position on procuring energy was guided by supply in the markets and prevailing global circumstances. The sentiment was echoed by two further government sources cited by the Reuters news agency. \"These are long-term oil contracts,\" one of the sources said. \"It is not so simple to just stop buying overnight.\" India is highly dependent on oil imports, which supply 87% of its needs, according to the International Energy Agency. The comments follow a threat made by President Trump to impose a 25% tariff on goods from India, as well as an additional import tax, because of New Delhi's purchases of Russian oil. The US president made ending the war in Ukraine a top priority - pledging to do so within his first 24 hours in office. But recently Mr Trump - who has repeatedly praised the Mr Putin over the years - has started to sour on the Russian leader for failing to agree to a ceasefire in Ukraine.  He called it \"disappointing\" and also threatened new economic sanctions on Russia if progress is not made. Mr Trump also this week said he had ordered two US nuclear submarines to be positioned in the \"appropriate regions\" in a row with former Russian president Dmitry Medvedev. The pressure on India comes after it upped it Russian crude purchases from 68,000 barrels per day in January 2022 to 1.12 million barrels per day by June that year. Supplies rose as high as nearly 40% of India's imports at one point, making Russia the largest supplier of crude to New Delhi, according to the Press Trust of India, citing data from analytics firm Kpler. Home to 1.3 billion people, India is expected to become an even bigger oil consumer over the remainder of the decade, fuelled by spectacular growth in its economy, as well as rising population and demographics. Demand has been rising fastest for petrol, with rising household incomes sparking a boom in motorcycle and car ownership."

The Metropolitan Police has since imposed conditions on the protest and counter-protest outside the Thistle City Barbican Hotel in Islington. The protest was organised by local residents under the banner \"Thistle Barbican needs to go - locals say no\". The group of several hundred people waved union flags and banners, and one man chanted: \"Get these scum off our streets.\" A larger group staged a counter demonstration to voice support for asylum seekers, bearing a banner that read: \"Refugees are welcome.\" People inside the hotel, believed to be migrants, watched on, with some waving and blowing kisses from the windows.

One was for also breaching those conditions, as well as twice assaulting an emergency worker. Police also arrested a 22-year-old woman for expressing support for Palestine Action. And a 33-year-old man, who was a part of the anti-immigration demonstration, was arrested for a racially aggravated public order offence. Rival groups separated by police Another protest was scheduled in Newcastle on Saturday, outside The New Bridge Hotel, as anti-migrant sentiment ripples through some communities around the country, also flaring up recently in Epping.  The counter-protest in London was organised by local branches of Stand Up To Racism, and supported by former Labour leader and Islington North MP Jeremy Corbyn. Other community groups including Finsbury Park Mosque and Islington Labour Party were also involved. Groups online that backed the original protest include \"Patriots of Britain\" and \"Together for the Children\". At one point, a large group of masked protesters dressed in black, calling themselves anti-fascists, appeared from a side street and marched towards the rival group outside the hotel. The two groups briefly clashed before police rushed in to separate them. Why are asylum hotels used? The government is legally required to provide accommodation and subsistence to destitute asylum seekers while their claims are being decided, most of whom are prohibited from working. A jump in the use of hotels since 2020 has been attributed to the impacts of the COVID pandemic, a backlog in unresolved asylum cases, and an increase in the number of migrants crossing the Channel in small boats. However, the number of asylum seekers living in hotels has fallen recently, from 38,079 at the end of 2024 to 32,345 at the end of March 2025, according to the Refugee Council. How police tried to keep groups apart The police imposed conditions on both groups in London to prevent \"serious disorder\" and minimise disruption to the community. Those in the anti-asylum hotel protest were told to remain within King Charles Square, and to gather not before 1pm and wrap up by 4pm. Those in the counter-protest were to required to stay in an area in Lever Street, and assemble only between 12pm and 4pm, but were still in eye and ear shot of the other group. Chief Superintendent Clair Haynes, in charge of the policing operation, said: \"We have been in discussions with the organisers of both protests in recent days, building on the ongoing engagement between local officers, community groups and partners. \"We understand that there are strongly held views on all sides. \"Our officers will police without fear or favour, ensuring those exercising their right to protest can do so safely, but intervening at the first sign of actions that cross the line into criminality.\" Meanwhile, the protest in Newcastle was promoted by online posts saying it was \"for our children, for our future\". The \"stop the far right and fascists in Newcastle\" counter-protest was organised by Stand Up To Racism at the nearby Laing Art Gallery."

        "Content": "\n          Arts and entertainment correspondent\n        For years now, many performers at Edinburgh Fringe have spoken about their struggles to afford the sky-high prices for their accommodation each August. This year, with Oasis's reunion tour coming to the city for three nights, the cost of securing a room for a month at the biggest arts festival in the world is even higher. Comedian Marc Borrows says \"the 'Oasis effect' on the Fringe economy has been catastrophic\". Rather fittingly, his stand-up show this year is called The Britpop Hour. \"It's an idea I'd had in my back pocket for a while,\" he explains. \"Then the band reformed and when I saw they were playing Edinburgh I thought 'yeah, this is the year to do this!'\" While he's thrilled that the Gallagher brothers are coming to town, it means many performers are taking a financial hit. \"I'll give you an example, I tried to get the same flat that I've had the last two years at the Fringe, a student flat, nothing fancy, and it costs an extra thousand pounds this year.\" Because of the increased demand for beds, newcomer Amy Albright will be sleeping in her red Volkswagen for her two-week stint at the Fringe. \"Costs are even more expensive,\" she says. \"It's just not an option for me, so instead I'm living in my car.\" With blackout blinds and a portable coffee maker, she says it's actually not as bad as some might think. \"I park just outside of town in a really nice safe area, I use a gym for showers ... this saves me so much money ... I wouldn't be able to afford to perform at the Fringe otherwise.\" Holly Spillar's show Tall Child explores her relationship with class. She was fortunate enough to be one of 180 recipients of a Â£2,500 bursary from the Edinburgh Festival Fringe Society. It is the third year the Keep it Fringe fund has been run, backed this year by a Â£1m injection of government money. As Holly explains: \"I live month to month on a minimum wage job ... and it costs me about five grand to do the fringe.\" Alongside the grant, she's also had to take out a loan, which she says will take her two years to pay back. \"It's a very precarious situation you put yourself in just to be in the room,\" she adds. Chloe Petts - now an established name on the comedy circuit - says the problem needs to be recognised for being less about Oasis and more about a problem that's been brewing for years. \"Accommodation is just totally out of control,\" she says. \"If this leads us to further conversations about that, then fantastic but ... it has to be a conversation about how it's totally unaffordable for the average person to come to the Fringe, and I think that's stopping a lot of people coming up who deserve to be here.\" Scottish comedian Susan McCabe, a lifelong Oasis fan, reckons there's no point getting too worked up, especially given the siblings fractious relationship. \"We are here every year and they may not even be here for those three gigs ... they might have fallen out by then!\" She adds: \"It is what it is, at the end of the day ... they were the greatest rock and roll band of the 1990s, just let them be.\" Read more:Jewish comedian says shows cancelled - as Gaza in spotlightWatch: How do geopolitics feed into Fringe festival? â¢ Amy Albright is performing her stand-up at locations across Edinburgh, including Not My Audience!, on 8 Augustâ¢ Holly Spillar: Tall Child is at Underbelly until 24 Augustâ¢ Chloe Petts: Big Naturals is at Pleasance Courtyard until 24 Augustâ¢ Susan McCabe: Best Behaviour is at Gordon Aikman Theatre until 24 Augustâ¢ The Britpop Hour with Marc Burrows is at Underbelly until 25 August"

The militant group said it was issuing a statement \"in response to media reports quoting US envoy Steve Witkoff, claiming [Hamas] has shown willingness to disarm\". It continued: \"We reaffirm that resistance and its arms are a legitimate national and legal right as long as the occupation continues. \"This right is recognised by international laws and norms, and it cannot be relinquished except through the full restoration of our national rights - first and foremost, the establishment of an independent, fully sovereign Palestinian state with Jerusalem as its capital.\" Hamas also condemned Mr Witkoff's visit to an aid distribution centre in Gaza on Friday as \"nothing more than a premeditated staged show\". Donald Trump's Middle East envoy Mr Witkoff and Mike Huckabee, the US ambassador to Israel, visited a centre run by the controversial Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF).  Hamas said the trip was \"designed to mislead public opinion, polish the image of the occupation, and provide it with political cover for its starvation campaign and continued systematic killing of defenceless children and civilians in the Gaza Strip\". Mr Witkoff said he spent \"over five hours in Gaza\". In a post on X on Friday, he said: \"The purpose of the visit was to give [President Trump] a clear understanding of the humanitarian situation and help craft a plan to deliver food and medical aid to the people of Gaza.\" Elidalis Burges, a critical care nurse in Gaza, told Sky News she saw the US visit as a \"PR stunt\" and that the American officials were \"just being shown a small portion of what is actually happening\".  \"I think the visit to the GHF site was just a controlled visit dictated by the Israeli military,\" she said. \"If they really wanted people to see what is happening here, they would allow international journalists from around the world to enter. \"They would allow the leaders of the world to come here and see.\" Hamas releases hostage video It comes as Hamas released a video showing Israeli man, Evyatar David, being held hostage in what appears to be a tunnel.  Mr David was taken from the Nova Music Festival on 7 October 2023. His family have given permission for media outlets to show the video. More than a dozen killed by Israeli fire Gaza health officials have said 18 people, including eight who were trying to access food, were killed by Israeli fire on Saturday. Witness Yahia Youssef told Reuters news agency he helped carry three people wounded by gunshots and saw others lying on the ground near a food distribution centre. In response to questions about several eyewitness accounts of violence at one of its facilities, GHF said \"nothing [happened] at or near our sites\". The US and Israel-backed GHF has been marred by controversy and fatal shootings ever since it was set up earlier this year. According to the United Nations' human rights office, at least 859 people have been killed \"in the vicinity\" of GHF aid sites since late May.

The Israel Defence Forces has repeatedly said it \"categorically rejects the claims of intentional harm to civilians\" and has blamed Hamas militants for fomenting chaos and endangering civilians.  The war in Gaza began when Hamas-led militants killed around 1,200 people, mostly civilians, in an attack on Israel on 7 October 2023 and abducted 251 others. Of those, they still hold around 50, with 20 believed to be alive, after most of the others were released in ceasefires or other deals. Israel's retaliatory offensive has killed more than 60,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry, which does not differentiate between militants and civilians in its count."

The now 24-year-old looks skeletal, with his shoulder blades protruding from his back, and says he has not eaten for three days. The distressing videos show him apparently digging his own grave. He worked in a restaurant, according to a video posted by Labour Friends of Israel, before he was abducted from the Nova music festival on 7 October 2023.  Since then, he has been held in captivity in Gaza, and the videos suggest he is being kept in dark tunnels and surviving on scarce portions of lentils and beans.

I barely get drinking water.\" The video shows him talking through what ate in July, which has been recorded on a handmade calendar hung up on the side of an underground Gaza tunnel. Speaking while under captivity and under duress, he adds: \"They give me what they can get.\" At the end of the video, he is digging a hole. The subtitle reads: \"This is the grave where I think I'm going to be buried in. Time is running out.\" He then appears to break down, crouching on the floor and leaning his head on his arm while still clinging to the shovel. In a statement, his family said: \"We are forced to witness our beloved son and brother, Evyatar David, deliberately and cynically starved in Hamas's tunnels in Gaza - a living skeleton, buried alive. \"Our son has only a few days left to live in his current condition.\" They added: \"Israel and the international community must oppose Hamas's cruelty and ensure that our Evyatar immediately receives proper nutrition. \"The intentional starvation, torture, and abuse of Evyatar for propaganda purposes violate even the lowest standards of humanitarian law and basic human decency.\"  'Famine' looms in Gaza On Friday, US special envoy Steve Witkoff visited a site where the US and Israel-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF) has been distributing food in Gaza.

        "Content": "By Victoria Seabrook, news reporter  India has indicated it will defy threats made by US President Donald Trump and continue buying Russian oil. The world's third-largest crude importer - after China and the US - cashed in on cheap Russian oil when its price plummeted after Vladimir Putin's full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Historically, it had bought most of its crude from countries in the Middle East. But this changed after the invasion in February 2022, when western countries slapped sanctions on Russia in a bid to choke off money fuelling Moscow's war chest.  It prompted the recent energy crisis that saw household bills in the UK soar. On Friday, the Indian foreign ministry said its relationship with Russia was \"steady and time-tested\", and warned against viewing it through the lens of another country. \n                  Trump orders two nuclear subs to be moved closer to Russia\n                 \n                  Trump ally calls for big tech 'united front' to fight UK and EU online safety laws\n                 \n                  Epstein abuse survivor Virginia Giuffre wanted files released, her family say\n                 Addressing a weekly meeting, spokesman Randhir Jaiswal said India's general position on procuring energy was guided by supply in the markets and prevailing global circumstances. The sentiment was echoed by two further government sources cited by the Reuters news agency. \"These are long-term oil contracts,\" one of the sources said. \"It is not so simple to just stop buying overnight.\" India is highly dependent on oil imports, which supply 87% of its needs, according to the International Energy Agency. The comments follow a threat made by President Trump to impose a 25% tariff on goods from India, as well as an additional import tax, because of New Delhi's purchases of Russian oil. The US president made ending the war in Ukraine a top priority - pledging to do so within his first 24 hours in office. But recently Mr Trump - who has repeatedly praised the Mr Putin over the years - has started to sour on the Russian leader for failing to agree to a ceasefire in Ukraine.  He called it \"disappointing\" and also threatened new economic sanctions on Russia if progress is not made. Mr Trump also this week said he had ordered two US nuclear submarines to be positioned in the \"appropriate regions\" in a row with former Russian president Dmitry Medvedev. The pressure on India comes after it upped it Russian crude purchases from 68,000 barrels per day in January 2022 to 1.12 million barrels per day by June that year. Supplies rose as high as nearly 40% of India's imports at one point, making Russia the largest supplier of crude to New Delhi, according to the Press Trust of India, citing data from analytics firm Kpler. Home to 1.3 billion people, India is expected to become an even bigger oil consumer over the remainder of the decade, fuelled by spectacular growth in its economy, as well as rising population and demographics. Demand has been rising fastest for petrol, with rising household incomes sparking a boom in motorcycle and car ownership."

Steve Witkoff and the US ambassador to Israel, Mike Huckabee, toured a Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF) distribution site in the southern city of Rafah on Friday. The Israeli-backed American contractor's efforts to deliver food to the region have been mired in violence and controversy, with hundreds killed by Israeli fire while walking to such aid sites since May, according to eyewitnesses, health officials and the UN human rights office. Israel's military says it has only fired warning shots at people who approached its forces, while GHF said its armed contractors have only fired warning shots to prevent deadly crowding.  Ms Hadithy said the situation in Gaza is \"absolutely desperate\" and a school classroom's worth of children \"are dying every single day\". She said there was \"a tangible difference in the amount of starvation and the emaciation of our patients\" during the three weeks she was in Gaza, adding: \"Even the severity of and relentlessness of the bombings was worse. \"It was mass casualty after mass casualty, with people being blown up in their tents, which were meant to be in green zones. The situation was catastrophic.\" She said one colleague - who she described as \"patient, joyful and hardworking\" - was followed home one day by a quadcopter drone, according to eyewitness testimony from fellow medical workers. The drone \"didn't kill him on the route where he was on his own, it waited until he was in his tent and greeted his three children and killed all of them\", she added. During her time in Gaza, Ms Hadithy said she saw \"emaciated children\", adding: \"So now you've got two million starving people in [an area] the same size as Exeter, which in our country and in our census in 2021 had 130,000 people in it. \"That's two million people with no water, no sanitation, no food, no medical supplies.\" Ms Hadithy also said Gazan health workers themselves are starving. \"Never before have I seen such dignified, committed people,\" she added.

        "Content": "A car has been found during the search for a man suspected of killing the parents, grandmother and uncle of a baby girl found abandoned in a US state.\n\n Austin Robert Drummond, 28, is suspected of having murdered four relatives in Tennessee - James M Wilson, 21, Adrianna Williams, 20, Cortney Rose, 38, and Braydon Williams, 15, who were identified on Wednesday. Mr Wilson and Adrianna Williams were the parents of the infant found alive in a car seat in a front yard on Tuesday afternoon. Police say Drummond then dropped off the baby and made people aware of the child, in an act of \"compassion\". However, officers added Drummond remains on the run and should be considered \"armed and dangerous\". Ms Rose was Adrianna and Braydon Williams' mother, according to District Attorney Danny Goodman. No details have been given on how they were murdered. Drummond dropped off the seven-month-old infant and brought attention to people nearby to come get the child, Tennessee Bureau of Investigation Director David Rausch said during a news conference. The baby is safe and being cared for, according to Stephen Sutton, a spokesperson for the Lake and Dyer county sheriffs. \"While this was an extremely tragic and violent event... there was a sign of compassion, if you will,\" Mr Rausch said. \"That tells us that there's a possibility that Austin may have a sense that there is hope for him to be able to come in and have a conversation about what happened.\" Mr Rausch said he believes it was a targeted attack by Drummond, who had a relationship with the victims and their family. A relative of the victims posted on Facebook after the deaths, saying the suspect has \"literally been nothing short of amazing to us and our kids\", according to our US partner network NBC News. \"We all trusted him,\" the relative added.

The Tennessee Bureau of Investigation has said it obtained warrants for Drummond. He is wanted on four counts of first-degree murder, one count of aggravated kidnapping, and weapons offences. Authorities offered a $15,000 reward for information leading to his arrest. Drummond was convicted of one count of aggravated robbery in August 2014, according to public records. His sentence ended in September 2024, according to Tennessee Department of Correction records. He was charged criminally for activities inside the prison, including attempted murder, after he completed the sentence that put him behind bars, District Attorney Mr Goodman said. Drummond was out on bond on the other charges at the time of the killings, he added."

        "Content": "A car has been found during the search for a man suspected of killing the parents, grandmother and uncle of a baby girl found abandoned in a US state.\n\n Austin Robert Drummond, 28, is suspected of having murdered four relatives in Tennessee - James M Wilson, 21, Adrianna Williams, 20, Cortney Rose, 38, and Braydon Williams, 15, who were identified on Wednesday. Mr Wilson and Adrianna Williams were the parents of the infant found alive in a car seat in a front yard on Tuesday afternoon. Police say Drummond then dropped off the baby and made people aware of the child, in an act of \"compassion\". However, officers added Drummond remains on the run and should be considered \"armed and dangerous\". Ms Rose was Adrianna and Braydon Williams' mother, according to District Attorney Danny Goodman. No details have been given on how they were murdered. Drummond dropped off the seven-month-old infant and brought attention to people nearby to come get the child, Tennessee Bureau of Investigation Director David Rausch said during a news conference. The baby is safe and being cared for, according to Stephen Sutton, a spokesperson for the Lake and Dyer county sheriffs. \"While this was an extremely tragic and violent event... there was a sign of compassion, if you will,\" Mr Rausch said. \"That tells us that there's a possibility that Austin may have a sense that there is hope for him to be able to come in and have a conversation about what happened.\" Mr Rausch said he believes it was a targeted attack by Drummond, who had a relationship with the victims and their family. A relative of the victims posted on Facebook after the deaths, saying the suspect has \"literally been nothing short of amazing to us and our kids\", according to our US partner network NBC News. \"We all trusted him,\" the relative added.

The Tennessee Bureau of Investigation has said it obtained warrants for Drummond. He is wanted on four counts of first-degree murder, one count of aggravated kidnapping, and weapons offences. Authorities offered a $15,000 reward for information leading to his arrest. Drummond was convicted of one count of aggravated robbery in August 2014, according to public records.

        "Content": "A jury has ruled that Tesla is partly to blame for the death of a young woman who was hit by an electric car on Autopilot. Naibel Benavides Leon was stargazing at the time of the collision, which sent her flying 22m (75ft) through the air in Florida. Her boyfriend was seriously injured in the 2019 incident, while her body was discovered in a wooded area. The company has now been ordered to pay $243m (Â£183m) in damages to Ms Benavides Leon's family, and to her partner Dillon Angulo. Jurors concluded that not all of the blame could be put on a reckless driver who admitted he was distracted by his phone before he hit the young couple. The motorist, George McGee, reached a separate settlement with the victims' families in an earlier case. Brett Schreiber, who represented the victims, said: \"Tesla designed Autopilot only for controlled-access highways yet deliberately chose not to restrict drivers from using it elsewhere, alongside Elon Musk telling the world Autopilot drove better than humans. \n                  Tesla looks to cheaper model as revenue suffers worst drop in over a decade\n                 \n                  Can Tesla survive without Trump?\n                 \n                  Revealed: The huge financial impact of Elon Musk's row with Donald Trump\n                 \"Today's verdict represents justice for Naibel's tragic death and Dillon's lifelong injuries.\"  Tesla - and Elon Musk - have said it will appeal the verdict, labelling it \"wrong\" and a setback for automotive safety. The verdict would also work to \"jeopardise Tesla's and the entire industry's efforts to develop and implement life-saving technology\", the company warmed. Tesla had claimed Mr McGee was solely to blame for the fatal crash because he had reached down to pick up a dropped mobile phone as his Model S sped through an intersection in Key Largo, Florida, at about 62mph. Mr McGee allegedly did not receive alerts as he ran a stop sign and a red light - and the plaintiffs' lawyer argued that the driver's assistance should have warned the driver and braked before the collision. The collision sent Ms Benavides Leon flying 22m (75ft) through the air, with her body later being discovered in a wooded area, while Mr Angulo suffered serious injuries. \"To be clear, no car in 2019, and none today, would have prevented this crash,\" Tesla said. \"This was never about Autopilot; it was a fiction concocted by plaintiffs' lawyers blaming the car when the driver - from day one - admitted and accepted responsibility.\" Read more from Sky News:Trump hits out again at 'stubborn moron'World's oldest baby born in the US Lawyers for the plaintiffs also alleged that Tesla either hid or lost key evidence, including data and video recorded seconds before the collision. They showed the court that the company had the evidence all along, despite repeated denials, after hiring a forensic data expert who dug it up. After being shown the evidence, Tesla said it made a mistake and honestly hadn't thought it was there. Past cases against Tesla were dismissed or settled, so the verdict in this case could encourage more legal action. Miguel Custodio, a car crash lawyer not involved in this trial, added: \"This will open the floodgates. It will embolden a lot of people to come to court.\" The verdict comes as Mr Musk plans to roll out a driverless taxi service, hoping to convince people his vehicles are safe enough to drive on their own. Improvements to the company's driver assistance and partial self-driving features have been made in recent years - but in 2023, 2.3 million Tesla vehicles were recalled amid fears Autopilot was failing to sufficiently alert drivers not paying attention to the road."

        "Content": "By Martin Kimber, business producer  Some of the world's leading tech companies are betting big on very small innovations. Last week, Samsung released its Galaxy Z Fold 7 which - when open - has a thickness of just 4.2mm, one of the slimmest folding phones ever to hit the market. And Honor, a spin-off from Chinese smartphone company Huawei, will soon ship its latest foldable - the slimmest in the world. Its new Honor Magic V5 model is only 8.8mm thick when folded, and a mere 4.1mm when open. Apple is also expected to release a foldable in the second half of next year, according to a note by analysts at JPMorgan published this week. The race to miniaturise technology is speeding up, the ultimate prize being the next evolution in consumer devices. Whether it be wearable devices, such as smartglasses, watches, rings or foldables - there is enormous market potential for any manufacturer that can make its products small enough. Despite being thinner than its predecessor, Honor claims its Magic V5 also offers significant improvements to battery life, processing power, and camera capabilities. \n                  Weekend Money: 'My seven-year-old pays rent' - when should parents start charging and how much?\n                 \n                  185-year-old Bridgerton costumier Angels screens investors\n                 \n                  US trade war: The state of play as Trump signs order imposing new tariffs - but there are more delays\n                 Hope Cao, a product expert at Honor told Sky News the progress was \"due largely to our silicon carbon battery technology\". These batteries are a next-generation breakthrough that offers higher energy density compared to traditional lithium-ion batteries, and are becoming more common in consumer devices. Honor also told Sky News it had used its own AI model \"to precisely test and find the optimum design, which was both the slimmest, as well as, the most durable.\" However, research and development into miniaturisation goes well beyond just folding phones. A company that's been at the forefront of developing augmented reality (AR) glasses, Xreal, was one of the first to release a viable pair to the consumer market. Xreal's Ralph Jodice told Sky News \"one of our biggest engineering challenges is shrinking powerful augmented reality technology into a form factor that looks and feels like everyday sunglasses\". Xreal's specs can display images on the lenses like something out of a sci-fi movie - allowing the wearer to connect most USB-C compatible devices such as phones, laptops and handheld consoles to an IMAX-sized screen anywhere they go. Experts at The Metaverse Society suggest prices of these wearable devices could be lowered by shifting the burden of computing from the headset to a mobile phone or computer, whose battery and processor would power the glasses via a cable. However, despite the daunting challenge, companies are doubling down on research and making leaps in the area. Social media giant Meta is also vying for dominance in the miniature market. Meta's Ray-Ban sunglasses (to which they recently added an Oakley range), cannot project images on the lenses like the pair from Xreal - instead they can capture photos, footage and sound. When connected to a smartphone they can even use your phone's 5G connection to ask Meta's AI what you're looking at, and ask how to save a particular type of houseplant for example. Gareth Sutcliffe, a tech and media analyst at Enders Analysis, tells Sky News wearables \"are a green field opportunity for Meta and Google\" to capture a market of \"hundreds of millions of users if these devices sell at similar rates to mobile phones\". Li-Chen Miller, Meta's vice president of product and wearables, recently said: \"You'd be hard-pressed to find a more interesting engineering problem in the company than the one that's at the intersection of these two dynamics, building glasses [with onboard technology] that people are comfortable wearing on their faces for extended periods of time ... and willing to wear them around friends, family, and others nearby.\" Mr Sutcliffe points out that \"Meta's R&D spend on wearables looks extraordinary in the context of limited sales now, but should the category explode in popularity, it will be seen as a great strategic bet.\" Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg's long-term aim is to combine the abilities of both Xreal and the Ray-Bans into a fully functioning pair of smartglasses, capable of capturing content, as well as display graphics onscreen. However, despite recently showcasing a prototype model, the company was at pains to point out that it was still far from ready for the consumer market. This race is a marathon not a sprint - or as Sutcliffe tells Sky News \"a decade-long slog\" - but 17 years after the release of the first iPhone, people are beginning to wonder what will replace it - and it could well be a pair of glasses."

        "Content": "\n          City editor\n              @MarkKleinmanSky\n One of the worldâs leading supplier of costumes to stars of stage and screen is in talks to secure external investment for the first time in its 185-year-old history. Sky News has learnt that Angels, which is based in London, is working with advisers to raise millions of pounds from the sale of a minority stake in the business. Kroll, the professional services firm, has been engaged to oversee the talks with prospective investors, which has been dubbed Project Carousel. This weekend, City sources said that Angels - which was founded in 1840 - had initiated talks with a number of parties who had a track record of investing in the media and showbusiness industries. Initial offers are understood to have been submitted in the last six weeks, with discussions ongoing. The company's principal clients include the BBC, Netflix, Amazon's Prime Video, Paramount Pictures and The Walt Disney Company. It saw its financial performance hit hard by the pandemic and then the Hollywood writers' and actors' strikes in 2023, which brought much of the film and television industries to a standstill. Angels has been through seven generations of family ownership, and is currently chaired by Tim Angel, a former chairman of BAFTA. The company was founded by Daniel Angel, who had arrived in London from Frankfurt in 1813 and set up a barrow selling secondhand clothing. Years later, when an actor asked if he could rent a suit rather than buy it from Mr Angel, his hire business took off, according to an history of the business published online. Notable moments in Angels' history included being called in during the 1920s to re-dress Madame Tussauds' collection of waxworks after the premises had been destroyed by fire. The company has supplied costumes for 47 Best Costume Oscar-winners, including Hamlet, Doctor Zhivago, Star Wars, Chariots of Fire, Braveheart, The English Patient, Shakespeare in Love, The Great Gatsby, and The Grand Budapest Hotel. It has also played a role supplying 37 Best Costume BAFTA-winners, according to information circulated by Kroll to potential investors. In 2016, Angels was itself awarded a BAFTA for Outstanding British Contribution to Cinema. Angels' collection of costumes numbers more than 1 million items, which would stretch for more than ten miles if hung next to each other. Its former head office on London's Shaftesbury Avenue is now a fancy dress shop with costumes available for hire. \"Our industry has been through some of its toughest years, from COVID and strikes to the LA fires, at one point leaving over 80% of our sector unemployed,\" said Jeremy Angel, a director of Angels. \"We stood by our staff, protected the business, and made it through. \"We are optimistic now with many new productions starting and government incentives coming in [and are] seeking a small investment to help us grow and continue supporting designers, directors, and actors, just as we've done since my family founded the business in 1840.\" Angels is understood to have recorded a loss in its last financial year but is forecasting a return to profitability in 2026, according to figures supplied by Kroll to interested parties."

        "Content": "\n          Political reporter\n              @alexrogerssky\n Zarah Sultana and Jeremy Corbyn may be the figureheads of a new left-wing party, but already there is a battle over leadership. The confusion behind the initial launch speaks to a wider debate happening behind closed doors as to who should steer the party - now and in the future. Already, in the true spirit of Mr Corbyn's politics, there is talk of an open leadership contest and grassroots participation. Some supporters of the new party - which is being temporarily called \"Your Party\" while a formal name is decided by members - believe that allowing a leadership contest to take place honours Mr Corbyn's commitment to open democracy.  They point out that under Mr Corbyn's leadership of the Labour Party, members famously backed plans to make it easier for local constituency parties to deselect sitting MPs - a concept he strongly believed in. His allies now say the former Labour leader, who is 76, is open to there being a leadership contest for the new party, possibly at its inaugural conference in the autumn, where names lesser known than himself can throw their hat into the ring. \"Jeremy would rather die than not have an open leadership contest,\" one source familiar with the internal politics told Sky News. \n                  Green leadership contenders reject calls for Corbyn pact - and say party must retain 'distinctive identity'\n                 \n                  How Corbyn's new party is preparing for battle - and where insiders think they could win\n                 \n                  Inside Jeremy Corbyn's new party: Is the Labour left making a comeback?\n                 However, there have been suggestions that Ms Sultana appears to be less keen on the idea of a leadership contest, and that she is more committed to the co-leadership model than her political partner. Those who have been opposed to the co-leadership model believe it could give Ms Sultana an unfair advantage and exclude other potential candidates from standing in the future.  One source told Sky News they believed Mr Corbyn should lead the party for two years, to get it established, before others are allowed to stand as leader. They said Ms Sultana, who became an independent MP after she was suspended from Labour for opposing the two-child benefit cap, was \"highly ambitious but completely untested as leader\" and \"had a lot of growing into the role to do\". \"It's not about her - it's about taking a democratic approach, which is what we're supposed to be doing,\" they said. \"There are so many people who have done amazing things locally and they need to have a chance to emerge as leaders. \"We are not only fishing from a pool of two people. \"It needs to be an open contest. Nobody needs to be crowned.\" Sky News approached Zarah Sultana for a comment. Although she didn't respond directly, she later tweeted her response. While Mr Corbyn and Ms Sultana undoubtedly have the biggest profiles out of would-be leaders, advocates for a grassroots approach to the leadership point to the success some independent candidates have enjoyed at a local level - for example, 24-year-old British Palestinian Leanne Mohamad, who came within 528 votes of unseating Health Secretary Wes Streeting in Ilford North.  Fiona Lali of the Revolutionary Communist Party, who stood in last year's general election for the Stratford and Bow constituency, has also been mentioned in some circles as someone with potential leadership credentials. However, sources close to Mr Corbyn and Ms Sultana downplayed suggestions of any divide over the leadership model, pointing out that their joint statement acknowledged that members would \"decide the party's direction\" at the inaugural conference in the autumn, including the model of leadership and the policies that are needed to transform society. Read more:Where insiders think Corbyn's new party could winPM would be foolish not to recognise threat party poses A spokesperson for Mr Corbyn told Sky News: \"Jeremy will be working with Zarah, his independent colleagues, and people from trade unions and social movements up and down the country to make an autumn conference a reality. \"This will be the moment where people come together to launch a new democratic party that belongs to the members.\""

        "Content": "Kemi Badenoch has said she does not see herself as Nigerian and no longer has a passport for the country she grew up in. The leader of the Conservative Party was born in the London suburb of Wimbledon but was raised in Lagos, Nigeria. When Nigeria's economy collapsed in the 1990s, Ms Badenoch, then aged 16, moved back to the UK to live with a family friend and continue her education. Speaking to former MP and television presenter Gyles Brandreth on the Rosebud podcast, Ms Badenoch said as most of her life has been in the UK, she \"does not identify\" as Nigerian. \"I'm Nigerian through ancestry, by birth, despite not being born there because of my parents... but by identity I'm not really,\" the North West Essex MP said. \"I have not renewed my Nigerian passport, I think, not since the early 2000s.\" Ms Badenoch added that her home is now where her family is, which includes her extended political family. On Nigeria, she said: \"I know the country very well, I have a lot of family there, and I'm very interested in what happens there.\" \"But home is where my now family is, and my now family is my children, it's my husband and my brother and his children, in-laws. The Conservative Party is very much part of my family - my extended family, I call it,\" she added. Ms Badenoch said on her return to Nigeria after her father, Femi, who was a GP with his own clinic, died, she faced a \"big fandango\" to get a visa. She also said her early experiences in Nigeria shaped her political outlook, including why she doesn't like socialism. \"I remember never quite feeling that I belonged there,\" she added.

A spokesperson for Ms Badenoch responded to Mr Shettima at the time, saying the Conservative leader was \"not the PR for Nigeria\"."

The four US, Russian and Japanese astronauts pulled up in their SpaceX capsule after launching from NASA's Kennedy Space Centre. Their arrival brought the current number of people at the station to 11. While a 15-hour trip is considered speedy by US standards, the Russians hold the record for the fastest trip to the space station - a lightning-fast three hours. The four astronauts to join the team on the ISS are NASA's Zena Cardman and Mike Fincke, Japan's Kimiya Yui and Russia's Oleg Platonov - each of whom had been originally assigned to other missions. \"Hello, space station,\" Mr Fincke radioed as soon as the capsule belonging to billionaire Elon Musk's space company docked high above the South Pacific. Ms Cardman and another astronaut were pulled from a SpaceX flight last year to make room for NASA's two stuck astronauts, Boeing Starliner test pilots Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams, who ended up stranded on the ISS for nine months. Mr Fincke and Mr Yui had been training for the next Starliner mission but switched to SpaceX as Starliner is grounded by thruster and other problems until 2026.

        "Content": "A jury has ruled that Tesla is partly to blame for the death of a young woman who was hit by an electric car on Autopilot. Naibel Benavides Leon was stargazing at the time of the collision, which sent her flying 22m (75ft) through the air in Florida. Her boyfriend was seriously injured in the 2019 incident, while her body was discovered in a wooded area. The company has now been ordered to pay $243m (Â£183m) in damages to Ms Benavides Leon's family, and to her partner Dillon Angulo. Jurors concluded that not all of the blame could be put on a reckless driver who admitted he was distracted by his phone before he hit the young couple. The motorist, George McGee, reached a separate settlement with the victims' families in an earlier case. Brett Schreiber, who represented the victims, said: \"Tesla designed Autopilot only for controlled-access highways yet deliberately chose not to restrict drivers from using it elsewhere, alongside Elon Musk telling the world Autopilot drove better than humans. \n                  Tesla looks to cheaper model as revenue suffers worst drop in over a decade\n                 \n                  Can Tesla survive without Trump?\n                 \n                  Revealed: The huge financial impact of Elon Musk's row with Donald Trump\n                 \"Today's verdict represents justice for Naibel's tragic death and Dillon's lifelong injuries.\"  Tesla - and Elon Musk - have said it will appeal the verdict, labelling it \"wrong\" and a setback for automotive safety. The verdict would also work to \"jeopardise Tesla's and the entire industry's efforts to develop and implement life-saving technology\", the company warmed. Tesla had claimed Mr McGee was solely to blame for the fatal crash because he had reached down to pick up a dropped mobile phone as his Model S sped through an intersection in Key Largo, Florida, at about 62mph. Mr McGee allegedly did not receive alerts as he ran a stop sign and a red light - and the plaintiffs' lawyer argued that the driver's assistance should have warned the driver and braked before the collision. The collision sent Ms Benavides Leon flying 22m (75ft) through the air, with her body later being discovered in a wooded area, while Mr Angulo suffered serious injuries. \"To be clear, no car in 2019, and none today, would have prevented this crash,\" Tesla said. \"This was never about Autopilot; it was a fiction concocted by plaintiffs' lawyers blaming the car when the driver - from day one - admitted and accepted responsibility.\" Read more from Sky News:Trump hits out again at 'stubborn moron'World's oldest baby born in the US Lawyers for the plaintiffs also alleged that Tesla either hid or lost key evidence, including data and video recorded seconds before the collision. They showed the court that the company had the evidence all along, despite repeated denials, after hiring a forensic data expert who dug it up. After being shown the evidence, Tesla said it made a mistake and honestly hadn't thought it was there. Past cases against Tesla were dismissed or settled, so the verdict in this case could encourage more legal action. Miguel Custodio, a car crash lawyer not involved in this trial, added: \"This will open the floodgates. It will embolden a lot of people to come to court.\" The verdict comes as Mr Musk plans to roll out a driverless taxi service, hoping to convince people his vehicles are safe enough to drive on their own. Improvements to the company's driver assistance and partial self-driving features have been made in recent years - but in 2023, 2.3 million Tesla vehicles were recalled amid fears Autopilot was failing to sufficiently alert drivers not paying attention to the road."

        "Content": "By Martin Kimber, business producer  Some of the world's leading tech companies are betting big on very small innovations. Last week, Samsung released its Galaxy Z Fold 7 which - when open - has a thickness of just 4.2mm, one of the slimmest folding phones ever to hit the market. And Honor, a spin-off from Chinese smartphone company Huawei, will soon ship its latest foldable - the slimmest in the world. Its new Honor Magic V5 model is only 8.8mm thick when folded, and a mere 4.1mm when open. Apple is also expected to release a foldable in the second half of next year, according to a note by analysts at JPMorgan published this week. The race to miniaturise technology is speeding up, the ultimate prize being the next evolution in consumer devices. Whether it be wearable devices, such as smartglasses, watches, rings or foldables - there is enormous market potential for any manufacturer that can make its products small enough. Despite being thinner than its predecessor, Honor claims its Magic V5 also offers significant improvements to battery life, processing power, and camera capabilities. \n                  Weekend Money: 'My seven-year-old pays rent' - when should parents start charging and how much?\n                 \n                  185-year-old Bridgerton costumier Angels screens investors\n                 \n                  US trade war: The state of play as Trump signs order imposing new tariffs - but there are more delays\n                 Hope Cao, a product expert at Honor told Sky News the progress was \"due largely to our silicon carbon battery technology\". These batteries are a next-generation breakthrough that offers higher energy density compared to traditional lithium-ion batteries, and are becoming more common in consumer devices. Honor also told Sky News it had used its own AI model \"to precisely test and find the optimum design, which was both the slimmest, as well as, the most durable.\" However, research and development into miniaturisation goes well beyond just folding phones. A company that's been at the forefront of developing augmented reality (AR) glasses, Xreal, was one of the first to release a viable pair to the consumer market. Xreal's Ralph Jodice told Sky News \"one of our biggest engineering challenges is shrinking powerful augmented reality technology into a form factor that looks and feels like everyday sunglasses\". Xreal's specs can display images on the lenses like something out of a sci-fi movie - allowing the wearer to connect most USB-C compatible devices such as phones, laptops and handheld consoles to an IMAX-sized screen anywhere they go. Experts at The Metaverse Society suggest prices of these wearable devices could be lowered by shifting the burden of computing from the headset to a mobile phone or computer, whose battery and processor would power the glasses via a cable. However, despite the daunting challenge, companies are doubling down on research and making leaps in the area. Social media giant Meta is also vying for dominance in the miniature market. Meta's Ray-Ban sunglasses (to which they recently added an Oakley range), cannot project images on the lenses like the pair from Xreal - instead they can capture photos, footage and sound. When connected to a smartphone they can even use your phone's 5G connection to ask Meta's AI what you're looking at, and ask how to save a particular type of houseplant for example. Gareth Sutcliffe, a tech and media analyst at Enders Analysis, tells Sky News wearables \"are a green field opportunity for Meta and Google\" to capture a market of \"hundreds of millions of users if these devices sell at similar rates to mobile phones\". Li-Chen Miller, Meta's vice president of product and wearables, recently said: \"You'd be hard-pressed to find a more interesting engineering problem in the company than the one that's at the intersection of these two dynamics, building glasses [with onboard technology] that people are comfortable wearing on their faces for extended periods of time ... and willing to wear them around friends, family, and others nearby.\" Mr Sutcliffe points out that \"Meta's R&D spend on wearables looks extraordinary in the context of limited sales now, but should the category explode in popularity, it will be seen as a great strategic bet.\" Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg's long-term aim is to combine the abilities of both Xreal and the Ray-Bans into a fully functioning pair of smartglasses, capable of capturing content, as well as display graphics onscreen. However, despite recently showcasing a prototype model, the company was at pains to point out that it was still far from ready for the consumer market. This race is a marathon not a sprint - or as Sutcliffe tells Sky News \"a decade-long slog\" - but 17 years after the release of the first iPhone, people are beginning to wonder what will replace it - and it could well be a pair of glasses."

        "Content": "\n          Arts and entertainment correspondent\n        For years now, many performers at Edinburgh Fringe have spoken about their struggles to afford the sky-high prices for their accommodation each August. This year, with Oasis's reunion tour coming to the city for three nights, the cost of securing a room for a month at the biggest arts festival in the world is even higher. Comedian Marc Borrows says \"the 'Oasis effect' on the Fringe economy has been catastrophic\". Rather fittingly, his stand-up show this year is called The Britpop Hour. \"It's an idea I'd had in my back pocket for a while,\" he explains. \"Then the band reformed and when I saw they were playing Edinburgh I thought 'yeah, this is the year to do this!'\" While he's thrilled that the Gallagher brothers are coming to town, it means many performers are taking a financial hit. \"I'll give you an example, I tried to get the same flat that I've had the last two years at the Fringe, a student flat, nothing fancy, and it costs an extra thousand pounds this year.\" Because of the increased demand for beds, newcomer Amy Albright will be sleeping in her red Volkswagen for her two-week stint at the Fringe. \"Costs are even more expensive,\" she says. \"It's just not an option for me, so instead I'm living in my car.\" With blackout blinds and a portable coffee maker, she says it's actually not as bad as some might think. \"I park just outside of town in a really nice safe area, I use a gym for showers ... this saves me so much money ... I wouldn't be able to afford to perform at the Fringe otherwise.\" Holly Spillar's show Tall Child explores her relationship with class. She was fortunate enough to be one of 180 recipients of a Â£2,500 bursary from the Edinburgh Festival Fringe Society. It is the third year the Keep it Fringe fund has been run, backed this year by a Â£1m injection of government money. As Holly explains: \"I live month to month on a minimum wage job ... and it costs me about five grand to do the fringe.\" Alongside the grant, she's also had to take out a loan, which she says will take her two years to pay back. \"It's a very precarious situation you put yourself in just to be in the room,\" she adds. Chloe Petts - now an established name on the comedy circuit - says the problem needs to be recognised for being less about Oasis and more about a problem that's been brewing for years. \"Accommodation is just totally out of control,\" she says. \"If this leads us to further conversations about that, then fantastic but ... it has to be a conversation about how it's totally unaffordable for the average person to come to the Fringe, and I think that's stopping a lot of people coming up who deserve to be here.\" Scottish comedian Susan McCabe, a lifelong Oasis fan, reckons there's no point getting too worked up, especially given the siblings fractious relationship. \"We are here every year and they may not even be here for those three gigs ... they might have fallen out by then!\" She adds: \"It is what it is, at the end of the day ... they were the greatest rock and roll band of the 1990s, just let them be.\" Read more:Jewish comedian says shows cancelled - as Gaza in spotlightWatch: How do geopolitics feed into Fringe festival? â¢ Amy Albright is performing her stand-up at locations across Edinburgh, including Not My Audience!, on 8 Augustâ¢ Holly Spillar: Tall Child is at Underbelly until 24 Augustâ¢ Chloe Petts: Big Naturals is at Pleasance Courtyard until 24 Augustâ¢ Susan McCabe: Best Behaviour is at Gordon Aikman Theatre until 24 Augustâ¢ The Britpop Hour with Marc Burrows is at Underbelly until 25 August"

        "Content": "Fans attending this month's Coldplay concerts in Hull could find themselves going viral thanks to the band's kiss cam. Dr Paul Sewell, chairman of rugby league team Hull Kingston Rovers, has confirmed that the famous kiss cam - which caught a US tech boss embracing one of his employees - will make an appearance at the British band's shows at Craven Park stadium. In a post on X, Dr Sewell wrote: \"To those business sorts bringing their PAs - the 'Big Kiss Cam' will feature!!\" It comes after the internet was sent into a frenzy over a clip of the chief executive of tech firm Astronomer, Andy Byron, being caught cuddling the company's chief people officer, Kristin Cabot, during a concert in Boston. The pair were picked from the crowd during the gig at the Gillette Stadium, in Massachusetts, on 16 July, and projected onto the big screen by the band's kiss cam. Once both of them realise, Mr Byron quickly ducks out of view, while Ms Cabot plunges her head into her hands and turns her back to the screen.  Coldplay's lead singer Chris Martin poked fun at the couple at the time - quipping: \"Either they're having an affair or they're very shy.\" Both Mr Byron and Ms Cabot subsequently resigned from Astronomer after the footage was posted online, and the company later released a tongue-in-cheek clip on social media - featuring Chris Martin's ex-wife Gwyneth Paltrow as a \"temporary spokesperson\".

It will be the first time the band has played in Hull and, in a world first for a stadium show, the Wembley gigs will be powered entirely by solar, wind and kinetic energy."

        "Content": "\n          News reporter\n              @ConnorSephton\n  A bishop who interrupted a church concert in his dressing gown - and told singers to \"leave his house\" - has formally apologised to the choir. Jonathan Baker was filmed standing barefoot at a microphone as he criticised performers for making a \"terrible racket\" at St Andrew's Church in central London. Addressing the City Academy Voices choir directly, the bishop of Fulham said: \"I write to apologise for the distress and offence I caused in bringing the concert to a premature end. \"This should not have happened â¦ I also apologise for remarks which were made in haste, and which have understandably caused hurt and distress.\" Mr Baker had demanded for the performance to stop because it was 10pm - and says he didn't realise the choir had booked the church until 11pm. In the statement obtained by Sky News, he added: \"I have lived here on site at St Andrew's for 10 years, for much of which City Academy has rehearsed and performed here. \"You have been, and continue to be, welcome - and I hope that you will be able to continue the relationship with us. \n                  Lucy was murdered in 2005.

A church employee then asked the crowd to leave quietly and for the musicians to step down from the stage, attracting boos from the audience. The choir went on to perform one last song, an A cappella version of ABBA's Dancing Queen, before bringing their show to a close.

Benedict Collins had said: \"This work deserves respect, not to be disparaged as a 'terrible racket'. The people here had put their heart and soul into it. \"The bishop cut them off in midstream, preventing soloists who had worked their hardest from singing - and preventing the audience, which included people of all ages, from enjoying it to the end.\" The choir told Sky News it was \"upsetting\" that they were unable to finish their show as planned, but \"hold no hard feelings and wish the bishop well\". A spokesperson added: \"If anyone is thinking of joining one of our choirs, the City Academy Voices rehearse on Mondays in central London. Dressing gowns optional.\""
