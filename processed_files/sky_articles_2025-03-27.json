        "Content": " The King has cancelled engagements on Friday due to \"temporary side effects\" from his cancer treatment. Buckingham Palace said after \"scheduled and ongoing medical treatment for cancer\" on Thursday morning, the King \"experienced temporary side effects that required a short period of observation in hospital\". \"His Majesty's afternoon engagements were therefore postponed,\" the statement added. The palace said the 76-year-old was now back at Clarence House but \"as a precautionary measure, acting on medical advice, tomorrow's diary programme will also be rescheduled\". \"His Majesty would like to send his apologies to all those who may be inconvenienced or disappointed as a result,\" the palace said. Sky's royal correspondent Laura Bundock said we are being \"advised this isn't a major problem in terms of his ongoing recovery\". A source also described it as a \"most minor bump in a road that is very much heading in the right direction\". Royal correspondent This news was unexpected, even though we've known the King is still undergoing treatment for his cancer. It is also unusual for the King to cancel engagements, especially this day in Birmingham which will have been meticulously planned.  That said, the palace is keen to stress he should be back to work as normal next week, and there's no sense this will have any effect on the upcoming state visit to Italy. \n The King enjoys his work and won't be happy letting people down. Some have said his work is what has helped keep him going through his diagnosis.\n Aides say this is a \"bump in the road\" and that overall the King's progress is heading in the right direction.\n But the fact they decided to make this announcement shows it was of some concern. It is also a reminder he remains a cancer patient, and with that, facing all the uncertainty and unpredictability the disease can present.\n The King revealed in February 2024 that he had been diagnosed with cancer and was beginning treatment. \n                  Prince William meets Clarkson's Farm star to discuss challenges the industry is facing\n                 \n                  Prince William's style of diplomacy is welcome in these tense times\n                 \n                  Prince William meets Estonia's president amid tensions with Russia\n                 He returned to public duties in April last year and sources suggested in December his treatment would continue in 2025 and was \"moving in a positive direction\". Following the side effects on Thursday, the King had to postpone audiences with ambassadors in the afternoon and was due to visit Birmingham on Friday. The palace said he was \"greatly disappointed\" to have to miss the trip but it hopes it can be rescheduled. The King and Queen are also set for a state visit to Italy in just over a week's time. On Wednesday, the King had a typically busy day of activities. He was at London's Somerset House, where he unveiled a plaque, before hosting a reception at Buckingham Palace in the evening. Last week, the royals also made a three-day visit to Northern Ireland.

He is maintaining as best he can all the challenges and tasks his role requires.\""

Following the summit, the prime minister spoke at a news conference at the UK ambassador's residence in Paris and accused the Russian president of \"playing games\" and \"playing for time\". He told reporters he would like to see a peace deal in Ukraine develop in a matter of days and weeks instead of months. When questioned about the \"reassurance force\", Sir Keir said it was \"designed to deter\" Mr Putin and defend whatever peace deal is agreed. He added: \"This will require the engagement and support of the United States\".

While there were no details about which nations would contribute military assets, Sir Keir did confirm the coalition had \"200 planners from 30 countries\". Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy gave a positive reaction to the summit, adding there were \"a number of countries who are prepared - either through the air or with boots on the ground - to provide security guarantees to Ukraine\". Sir Keir also confirmed that Parliament would \"have a say\" if British troops were deployed on a long-term basis. Donald Trump has said he wants to broker a swift end to the war. But a series of bilateral talks between the US and the warring sides has yet to yield significant results. Agreements brokered by the US to safeguard shipping in the Black Sea and to halt long-range strikes on energy infrastructure have been widely welcomed as a first step toward peace. But Ukraine and Russia have disagreed over the details and accused each other of violating the deals."

        "Content": "By Laura Bundock, health correspondent, and Megan Harwood-Baynes, social affairs and health reporter  The mother of a young girl operated on 17 times by a now-suspended surgeon has told Sky News she's \"angry and so upset\" and fears her daughter may never walk again. Her child is only eight years old and now needs further surgery, including a hip replacement. She was one of nine patients whose treatment fell below the expected standard at Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge. The Department of Health told Sky News the situation is \"incredibly concerning\". The little girl's case was uncovered following an external review into the specialist paediatric surgeon who has since been suspended. The child was born with hip dysplasia, a condition affecting the hip socket, which can usually be fixed. But issues with her operations have left her using a wheelchair and crutches. Her mother, who's asked not to be named, said: \"It's like a big limp. She is not stable and can't balance on that leg, so she always has to have an aide with her because she would fall over and hurt herself.\" Notes given to the family list a catalogue of serious issues involving the surgeon's treatment, including \"problems with both judgement and technique\". Cambridge University Hospitals Trust is now reviewing 800 patients treated by the same surgeon. Of these, 700 are children who underwent planned orthopaedic surgery. Another 100 are patients who received emergency trauma surgery. What's troubling the family now is that concerns were first raised about the surgeon a decade ago. The mother said: \"My daughter wasn't born until 2016, so had the trust acted on this correctly, my daughter probably would never have seen that consultant and she would have probably been fine.\" An independent external investigation team is assessing whether issues could have been addressed earlier. Sky News has spoken to several clinicians working at Addenbrooke's. One is so concerned that they've contacted Health Secretary Wes Streeting, claiming the damage caused was \"all avoidable\" and that \"many lives have been ruined\". Read more on Sky News:Putin says US is serious about GreenlandEuropean allies not united on armed deployment in UkraineWoman charged with stalking McCann family 'The pain was all the time' Tammy Harrison is 12 years old and has cerebral palsy. She was also operated on by the now-suspended surgeon. There's no evidence of any wrongdoing yet, but one of her operations didn't work and left her in agonising pain. \"It felt like I was being stabbed. The pain was all the time, I couldn't move and I couldn't even get out of bed,\" Tammy said. She's now unable to sit on the floor, and her legs are different lengths. Her mum, Lynn, said she became worried about her care shortly after the operation. She said: \"The pain level wasn't deteriorating. It just seemed like she was getting worse. And at the six-week review, I asked, why is she still in so much pain? And it was just brushed underneath her carpet.\" Cambridge University Hospitals say they're deeply sorry and will do everything they can to support families and patients. Lawyers representing one of the families say the numbers potentially impacted are \"staggering\". Medical negligence solicitor at Osborne Law, Jodi Newton, said: \"It's clearly shocking in terms of the types of patients involved, in that most of those are children, and numbers - what we don't know is whether there is going to be more patients than those already identified. It could be in its thousands.\" Families are now anxiously waiting for answers and the truth about their children's treatment. 'I wish I had spoken up more' Lynn Harrison said: \"I'm glad it's come to light, and I wasn't being an overprotective mum. \"But I am angry. I wish I had spoken up more and pushed further because other patients might not have had to suffer.\""

        "Content": "\n          Europe correspondent\n              @adamparsons\n  As European summits on the Ukraine war go, this one had the feel of a tempting, high-end takeaway meal. You look forward to it and it tastes great. The delivery is superb, but it's all over with disconcerting speed and then, an hour or two later, you're wondering if you ever actually ate anything. What we got here were lots of good wishes, plenty of diplomatic heft, and a torrent of words. Sir Keir Starmer, Emmanuel Macron and Volodymyr Zelenskyy all praised the summit and built up the idea that Europe was united like rarely before, standing at a crucial juncture. Each spoke with enthusiasm and fluency. Each emphasised their disdain for Russia's promises and their desire to push Russia. There was a new phrase called into action - a \"reassurance force\" that might be in place to police a ceasefire. But then there were the ingredients that were missing. For one - real clarity about what is being planned, or demanded. About how Russia can be persuaded, much less forced, into stopping its aggression. And desperate caution over the taut relationship with the United States. When I asked Starmer how he could possibly rely on an administration whose senior figures had described European leaders as \"pathetic\" and \"freeloaders\", he dodged the question. Another colleague asked for details about a deadline that the prime minister had referenced - what, and when, was it, he asked. What became clear was that the leaders had not actually agreed to impose a deadline as we might understand it, but had actually concluded that there should be a deadline. At some point. And about something. Read more on Sky News:Putin says US is serious about GreenlandSix dead after tourist submarine sinks in Egypt Progress was made, and it should not be downgraded. It's clear that military planning and intelligence will come from Europe to a greater level than it had done previously, and that there is a consensus that the Ukrainian armed forces will need to be bolstered for the long term. There is also a growing sense that Europe needs to drastically improve its military preparedness by spending more, working together more, and by building more of its own equipment. The days of buying quite so much from the Americans are, quite clearly, under review. The problem is that Trump and his team are operating in a way that feels alien to the members of this self-styled 'coalition of the willing'. The president is prone to make huge disruptive promises, and then leaving others to either pick up the pieces or else to reverse engineer their way to some kind of result. Thoughtful deliberation, for so long the bedrock of diplomacy, appears absent, and European leaders, who tend to love a bit of debate and pondering, don't quite know how to react."

        "Content": " The Serbian ambassador to Britain has said critics should \"wait for the results\" of an investigation after claims an illegal sonic weapon was used against protesters earlier this month. He told The World With Yalda Hakim that no illegal weapon was used at the anti-government protest in Belgrade and that \"independent experts\" had been invited to investigate. \"According to statements of our government officials… nothing [illegal] was used that day,\" Goran Aleksic said. \"Independent experts were invited to come to Serbia to do a thorough analysis of this. And I think the best thing is to wait for the results of that and then to draw conclusions.\" More than half a million people have signed a petition calling for an independent investigation. Recent footage has added to mounting speculation surrounding dispersal tactics used at the 15 March demonstration attended by tens of thousands of people in Serbia's capital. The incident took place during a 15-minute period of silence to honour victims of the Novi Sad disaster in 2024 - when a concrete canopy at a rail station collapsed, killing 16 people. Footage shows protesters holding up their lit mobile phones when suddenly there was a swooshing sound, and the crowds started running away. Sonic weapons, which are illegal in Serbia, emit sound waves that can trigger physical and psychological effects, including dizziness, severe headaches, sharp ear pain, disorientation, eardrum ruptures, or even irreversible hearing damage. Serbia's populist president, Aleksandar Vucic, has dismissed the claims as \"lies and fabrications\". Ilic Sunderic, who was at the rally, said it was \"quiet and peaceful and then we heard something we could not see… like a sound rolling toward us\". It was, she said, \"a subdued sound lasting only two to three seconds but very unusual and very frightening, like a sound from hell\". \"I have been going to protests for 30 years, but I've never heard anything like this,\" she added.

The Red Sea, renowned for its coral reefs and marine life, is a major hub for Egypt's crucial tourism industry, in which Russian tourists play an increasingly large part. A United Nations report ranked Egypt first in Africa for tourism revenues in 2024 at $14.1bn (£11bn), more than twice what it earns in Suez Canal revenues, highlighting tourism's vital role in sustaining the hard-pressed economy. However, some tourist companies have stopped or limited travelling on the Red Sea due to the dangers from conflicts in the region. In November, four people drowned and 33 were rescued when a tourist diving boat was struck by high waves and sank within minutes."

        "Content": "\n          Political correspondent\n              @wizbates\n  Chancellor Rachel Reeves delivered her spring statement this week. Now we've heard the detail we've picked out three key policy areas from Labour's plan for change - health, growth and housing - and asked three experts to give their verdict. Here's their view on how the government is doing so far: Politics latest: Follow live updates The pledge: Ending hospital backlogs to meet the NHS standard of 92% of patients in England waiting no longer than 18 weeks for elective treatment. The expert: Matthew Taylor, chief executive of the NHS Confederation The verdict: \n                  'Child poverty will increase for first time under Labour and it's paving way for Reform', Corbyn warns Starmer\n                 \n                  'Why would they target that?': Backlash over welfare cuts on 'people that need extra help'\n                 \n                  Lower-income households set to be £500 poorer after chancellor's spring statement - thinktank\n                 I think the critical thing was the financially challenging environment we find ourselves in is going to be even more challenging next year and the year after. So, we're talking about an unprecedented squeeze on the overall amount of money available to the health service. The NHS leaders I represent are having to make cuts of 6%, 7%, 8% in their overall budgets, but they know now that the year after and the year after that are going to be even tougher.  How about NHS modernisation? If we don't do things differently, I fear what we'll see is what we've seen in the past, which is more money going into acute hospitals. This is the most expensive, least effective way of providing healthcare. Rather, more money should be going into primary, into community. So we really have to accelerate the reform process if we're going to be able to get more with less. The score: 7/10 …but we're waiting for a 10-year plan, and until we really know what the plan is, it's very difficult to judge. The pledge: Raising living standards in every part of the United Kingdom, so working people have more money in their pocket as we aim to deliver the highest sustained growth in the G7. The expert: Praful Nargund, director and founder of the Good Growth Foundation The verdict: In the short term, it's still very hard for the economy. I mean, you're looking at the OBR downgrading growth, halving their growth estimate for this year. You have a better picture longer term. You see the housing and planning reforms, meaning gains in productivity and growth. You're seeing household disposable income potentially rise at the end of the parliament by £500 per household. What about the cost of living? People want to see change more quickly. They want to see benefits more quickly from an economy changing. Also, we're far too exposed to volatility and instability in the world, especially with Trump tariffs coming down the line. The score: 7/10 Long term some really good reforms are coming. Short term we want to see a whole government approach to getting growth happening very soon.  The pledge: Building 1.5 million homes in England and fast-tracking planning decisions on at least 150 major economic infrastructure projects - more than the last 14 years combined. The expert: Clare Miller, chief executive at Clarion Housing Group The verdict: There was the announcement from the chancellor that she's putting an extra £2bn of capital investment into the affordable homes programme. Investment in that area will enable us to be able to build more homes. However, it's not a silver bullet. And clearly what we need is a long-term solution in order to enable charitable housing associations like my own, and to be able to work with the government to deliver over the longer term. What do you think about leasehold properties? What the government would like to do is to move to a common hold form of tenure, which potentially gives the residents living in those blocks more control and more say over the services that are delivered to those residents. I think that that is a positive step. But we will have to see how it is rolled out. The score: ??? Forgive me for not giving a mark out of 10 at this stage, because I think we have only seen the first steps."

A suspect was overpowered and apprehended in the Gravenstraat area shortly after the incident by a member of the public. The suspect was said to have sustained an injury to his leg, and was taken to hospital. As of late Thursday, the motive behind the attack was unclear and remained under investigation. Police said it was considering the possibility that it was a random attack. \n                  One person killed and several hurt after explosion in The Hague\n                 \n                  Organised crime gang members jailed after helping smuggle up to £7bn worth of drugs into UK\n                 \n                  What we know about violence involving football fans in Amsterdam\n                 The area was cordoned off and several ambulances were called to the scene.

        "Content": " The King has cancelled engagements on Friday due to \"temporary side effects\" from his cancer treatment. Buckingham Palace said after \"scheduled and ongoing medical treatment for cancer\" on Thursday morning, the King \"experienced temporary side effects that required a short period of observation in hospital\". \"His Majesty's afternoon engagements were therefore postponed,\" the statement added. The palace said the 76-year-old was now back at Clarence House but \"as a precautionary measure, acting on medical advice, tomorrow's diary programme will also be rescheduled\". \"His Majesty would like to send his apologies to all those who may be inconvenienced or disappointed as a result,\" the palace said. Sky's royal correspondent Laura Bundock said we are being \"advised this isn't a major problem in terms of his ongoing recovery\". A source also described it as a \"most minor bump in a road that is very much heading in the right direction\". Royal correspondent This news was unexpected, even though we've known the King is still undergoing treatment for his cancer. It is also unusual for the King to cancel engagements, especially this day in Birmingham which will have been meticulously planned.  That said, the palace is keen to stress he should be back to work as normal next week, and there's no sense this will have any effect on the upcoming state visit to Italy. \n The King enjoys his work and won't be happy letting people down. Some have said his work is what has helped keep him going through his diagnosis.\n Aides say this is a \"bump in the road\" and that overall the King's progress is heading in the right direction.\n But the fact they decided to make this announcement shows it was of some concern. It is also a reminder he remains a cancer patient, and with that, facing all the uncertainty and unpredictability the disease can present.\n The King revealed in February 2024 that he had been diagnosed with cancer and was beginning treatment. \n                  Prince William meets Clarkson's Farm star to discuss challenges the industry is facing\n                 \n                  Prince William's style of diplomacy is welcome in these tense times\n                 \n                  Prince William meets Estonia's president amid tensions with Russia\n                 He returned to public duties in April last year and sources suggested in December his treatment would continue in 2025 and was \"moving in a positive direction\". Following the side effects on Thursday, the King had to postpone audiences with ambassadors in the afternoon and was due to visit Birmingham on Friday. The palace said he was \"greatly disappointed\" to have to miss the trip but it hopes it can be rescheduled. The King and Queen are also set for a state visit to Italy in just over a week's time. On Wednesday, the King had a typically busy day of activities. He was at London's Somerset House, where he unveiled a plaque, before hosting a reception at Buckingham Palace in the evening. Last week, the royals also made a three-day visit to Northern Ireland.

        "Content": "\n          Political reporter\n              @fayebrownSky\n  Child poverty is set to increase under a Labour government for the first time in history and an \"alternative path\" is needed to stop the rise of Reform UK, Sir Keir Starmer has been warned. A joint statement signed by former Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn and other cross-party MPs calls for a wealth tax on those with assets over £10m \"so we can rebuild our schools and hospitals\". Politics Live: Protesters interrupt minister's speech The letter, in response to Rachel Reeves's spring statement, says the chancellor has made a \"choice\" to push more disabled people and children into poverty by announcing departmental spending cuts while increasing money invested into defence. \"This isn't about scarcity, it's about priorities\", it said, adding: \"This is set to be the first Labour government in history under which child poverty increases. \"Labour's failure has paved the way for Reform. We need an alternative path. \"Parroting the rhetoric of Reform UK on migrants, minorities and Muslims just endorses their scapegoating and makes society worse for us all.\" \n                  Labour unease builds over suggestions ministers could axe digital tax on tech giants\n                 \n                  UK will 'keep all options on the table' amid Trump's trade wars, PM says\n                 \n                  Lower-income households set to be £500 poorer after chancellor's spring statement - thinktank\n                 As well as Mr Corbyn, who is now an independent MP, the statement was signed by suspended Labour MPs Sarah Zultana and Apsana Begum, Green MPs, independents and other figures calling for \"progressive politics\".  It comes ahead of the launch of Reform UK's local election campaign on Friday, with the party hoping to make gains in May after overtaking Labour in multiple polls. The letter describes the \"alternative path\" as one where the richest in society and multinational companies face higher taxes, rent controls are brought in, water and energy are nationalised and money is invested \"in welfare, not warfare\". These measures have previously been ruled out by Ms Reeves, but she is coming under pressure following her spring statement on Wednesday. Spring statement takeaways The economic update included a £2.2bn increase in defence spending over the next year to help the government reach its goal of spending 2.5% of GDP on defence by 2027. The chancellor also deepened previously announced welfare cuts alongside further departmental spending reductions to make up for £10bn in lost fiscal headroom since her October budget, caused by poor growth and global instability. The government's own impact assessment estimates another 250,000 people - including 50,000 children - could be pushed into relative poverty by 2030 because of the measures. However Ms Reeves said that assessment did not take into account steps the government was taking to get people back into work. She has also rejected a separate analysis that suggests the average family could be £1,400 a year worse off by the end of the decade. Labour MPs unhappy  Several Labour MPs have spoken out against the cuts and some have said they will vote against them. However Ms Reeves is believed to have staved off a full-scale rebellion for now, as most trust she is serious about getting the nation's finances back on track. Read More:Backlash over welfare cutsCorbyn brands benefit cuts a 'disgrace'  The chancellor is determined to stick to her self-imposed fiscal rules, including using tax receipts rather than borrowing to account for day-to-day spending. However she may come under pressure to change course if global factors like Donald Trump's trade war eat into her fiscal headroom again by the time of the next budget in October - meaning she would have to raise taxes or announce further spending cuts in order to balance the books. The Institute for Fiscal Studies has warned tax rises are likely in the autumn as Ms Reeves has left herself vulnerable to forecast changes, speculating that pensioners and the wealthiest could be targeted in the raid. Earlier this week, a YouGov poll found three quarters of the British public would support tax rises on the very richest over expected cuts to public spending, including a 2% wealth tax on net assets worth more than £10m."

Overall, there was a 2.9% decrease in the number of sewage spills last year compared to 2023, according to water company data collected and analysed by the Environment Agency. Despite this small improvement in the number of events, the duration of spills - the amount of time a water treatment plant discharges untreated sewage into a river or the sea - increased by 0.2%. \"This year's data shows we are still a long way off where we need to be to stop unnecessary sewage pollution,\" said Alan Lovell, chair of the Environment Agency. The EA says it has secured £10.2bn from water companies to reduce sewage dumping. \"While these improvements get under way, we expect water companies to do what customers pay it to do: ensure their existing assets are maintained and operating properly,\" said Mr Lovell. 'Stark reminder' \n                  Three quarters of a million pieces of rubbish found on UK beaches\n                 \n                  An abundance of marine life - but the wildlife of the Falkland Islands is more vulnerable than most\n                 \n                  New planning bill could be the government's most important - but will it work in practice?\n                 The latest data is bad, if not unexpected news, for the government. \"These figures are disgraceful and are a stark reminder of how years of underinvestment have led to water companies discharging unacceptable levels of sewage into our rivers, lakes and seas,\" said Environment Secretary Steve Reed.  The government says part of its £100bn public infrastructure investment plans will address water pollution. But repairing or replacing thousands of miles of ageing water pipes and dilapidated water treatment works, as well as building new ones, is expected to take decades. This year, it also introduced the Water (Special Measures) Act which it said it would use to get \"tough\" on water companies. The bill allows for the banning of bonuses for water company bosses failing to meet targets and allows criminal charges to be brought against companies in breach of the law. The government, however, may soon find itself in the stink. Read more from Sky News:BAFTA TV Awards nominations revealedPair held in probe into vandalism at Trump golf resort Last week, environment watchdog the Office for Environmental Protection (OEP) announced it was launching an investigation into whether proposed plans from the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA) to clean up waterways are in breach of the law. The OEP is to decide whether DEFRA's plans, implemented by the Environment Agency and the water regulator Ofwat, are too generic and fail to address the environmental risk of sewage pollution at particular sites. England, for example, is home to the majority of the world's chalk stream rivers and streams that are particularly sensitive to sewage pollution. 'Still broken' For clean water campaigners, the latest data is just more of the same. \"The water industry is still broken,\" said James Wallace, chief executive of River Action. He added: \"The numbers are staggering: over 3.6 million hours of sewage spills from almost 450,000 discharges. \"That's equivalent to 412 continuous years of sewage polluting our rivers, lakes and seas.\" The frustration for consumers is that many of us will see significant increases to our bills in order to finance the investments being demanded by Ofwat and the government to meet pollution targets. Last year, an independent Water Commission was launched by the government. Led by Sir Jon Cunliffe, it is charged with coming up with long-term reforms for the way water companies are regulated. The commission should look at the structure and ownership of water companies themselves, according to campaigners. \"[It] must put an end to this failed privatisation experiment and force real reform of the industry and regulators,\" said Mr Wallace. \"We need to learn from our European neighbours, and use finance and governance models that put people and nature before investors.\""

        "Content": "By Laura Bundock, health correspondent, and Megan Harwood-Baynes, social affairs and health reporter  The mother of a young girl operated on 17 times by a now-suspended surgeon has told Sky News she's \"angry and so upset\" and fears her daughter may never walk again. Her child is only eight years old and now needs further surgery, including a hip replacement. She was one of nine patients whose treatment fell below the expected standard at Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge. The Department of Health told Sky News the situation is \"incredibly concerning\". The little girl's case was uncovered following an external review into the specialist paediatric surgeon who has since been suspended. The child was born with hip dysplasia, a condition affecting the hip socket, which can usually be fixed. But issues with her operations have left her using a wheelchair and crutches. Her mother, who's asked not to be named, said: \"It's like a big limp. She is not stable and can't balance on that leg, so she always has to have an aide with her because she would fall over and hurt herself.\" Notes given to the family list a catalogue of serious issues involving the surgeon's treatment, including \"problems with both judgement and technique\". Cambridge University Hospitals Trust is now reviewing 800 patients treated by the same surgeon. Of these, 700 are children who underwent planned orthopaedic surgery. Another 100 are patients who received emergency trauma surgery. What's troubling the family now is that concerns were first raised about the surgeon a decade ago. The mother said: \"My daughter wasn't born until 2016, so had the trust acted on this correctly, my daughter probably would never have seen that consultant and she would have probably been fine.\" An independent external investigation team is assessing whether issues could have been addressed earlier. Sky News has spoken to several clinicians working at Addenbrooke's. One is so concerned that they've contacted Health Secretary Wes Streeting, claiming the damage caused was \"all avoidable\" and that \"many lives have been ruined\".

She was also operated on by the now-suspended surgeon. There's no evidence of any wrongdoing yet, but one of her operations didn't work and left her in agonising pain. \"It felt like I was being stabbed. The pain was all the time, I couldn't move and I couldn't even get out of bed,\" Tammy said. She's now unable to sit on the floor, and her legs are different lengths. Her mum, Lynn, said she became worried about her care shortly after the operation. She said: \"The pain level wasn't deteriorating. It just seemed like she was getting worse. And at the six-week review, I asked, why is she still in so much pain? And it was just brushed underneath her carpet.\" Cambridge University Hospitals say they're deeply sorry and will do everything they can to support families and patients. Lawyers representing one of the families say the numbers potentially impacted are \"staggering\". Medical negligence solicitor at Osborne Law, Jodi Newton, said: \"It's clearly shocking in terms of the types of patients involved, in that most of those are children, and numbers - what we don't know is whether there is going to be more patients than those already identified. It could be in its thousands.\" Families are now anxiously waiting for answers and the truth about their children's treatment. 'I wish I had spoken up more' Lynn Harrison said: \"I'm glad it's come to light, and I wasn't being an overprotective mum. \"But I am angry. I wish I had spoken up more and pushed further because other patients might not have had to suffer.\""

        "Content": "UK greenhouse gas emissions fell by 3.5% last year compared with 2023, according to provisional government figures. The Energy Department (DESNZ) said climate-warming emissions generated in the UK were 371.4 million tonnes of carbon equivalent in 2024. That's down from 385 million tonnes in 2023 and 406 million tonnes in 2022. The latest figure is 54% lower than in 1990. As a signatory to the 2015 Paris Agreement, the UK is aiming to reduce emissions by 68% by 2030 and 81% by 2035 compared with 1990 levels. The aim is to get to net-zero by 2050, meaning Britain would no longer be adding to the total amount of gases in the atmosphere. DESNZ said the fall was largely due to reductions from the electricity supply and industry sectors, which made up 10% and 13% of emissions respectively. \n                  Shell's new strategy is good news for your savings\n                 \n                  Climate action will make British people 'more secure', says UK envoy, after Badenoch claimed it would hit living standards\n                 \n                  Fresh evidence of global warming - as politicians question climate action\n                 Electricity supply drove the largest share of the reduction, as more electricity imports and increased renewable generation led to lower gas and coal use in power stations. The UK's last coal-fired power station, Ratcliffe-on-Soar in Nottinghamshire, actually closed at the end of September. Domestic transport was the biggest emitter in 2024, added DESNZ, making up 30% of total emissions. However, it was down 1.5% on the previous year. Emissions in the building and product use sector - already the UK's second-largest emitter, making up 21% of the total - increased by 2.3%. Notably, last year was a record for renewable energy generation, such as wind and solar. It was the source of 50.8% of the UK's electricity in 2024, up from 46.4%, according to DESNZ. It's the first year renewables have exceeded 50%.

However, he said that \"while emissions are falling, we're still very much dependent on expensive and polluting gas for our energy\". \"The government must put a stop to the great gas rip-off and rapidly make renewables the backbone of our energy system to lower our bills for good,\" Mr Parr added."

The French president said some nations disagreed on the proposed deployment of an armed force to back up an eventual peace deal in Ukraine, with only some wanting to take part. \"It is not unanimous,\" he said during a news conference after the third summit of the so-called \"coalition of the willing\" on Thursday, with leaders meeting in Paris to coordinate their stance.

Following the summit, the prime minister spoke at a news conference at the UK ambassador's residence in Paris and accused the Russian president of \"playing games\" and \"playing for time\". He told reporters he would like to see a peace deal in Ukraine develop in a matter of days and weeks instead of months. When questioned about the \"reassurance force\", Sir Keir said it was \"designed to deter\" Mr Putin and defend whatever peace deal is agreed. He added: \"This will require the engagement and support of the United States\".

While there were no details about which nations would contribute military assets, Sir Keir did confirm the coalition had \"200 planners from 30 countries\". Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy gave a positive reaction to the summit, adding there were \"a number of countries who are prepared - either through the air or with boots on the ground - to provide security guarantees to Ukraine\". Sir Keir also confirmed that Parliament would \"have a say\" if British troops were deployed on a long-term basis. Donald Trump has said he wants to broker a swift end to the war. But a series of bilateral talks between the US and the warring sides has yet to yield significant results. Agreements brokered by the US to safeguard shipping in the Black Sea and to halt long-range strikes on energy infrastructure have been widely welcomed as a first step toward peace. But Ukraine and Russia have disagreed over the details and accused each other of violating the deals."

        "Content": " The Serbian ambassador to Britain has said critics should \"wait for the results\" of an investigation after claims an illegal sonic weapon was used against protesters earlier this month. He told The World With Yalda Hakim that no illegal weapon was used at the anti-government protest in Belgrade and that \"independent experts\" had been invited to investigate. \"According to statements of our government officials… nothing [illegal] was used that day,\" Goran Aleksic said. \"Independent experts were invited to come to Serbia to do a thorough analysis of this. And I think the best thing is to wait for the results of that and then to draw conclusions.\" More than half a million people have signed a petition calling for an independent investigation. Recent footage has added to mounting speculation surrounding dispersal tactics used at the 15 March demonstration attended by tens of thousands of people in Serbia's capital. The incident took place during a 15-minute period of silence to honour victims of the Novi Sad disaster in 2024 - when a concrete canopy at a rail station collapsed, killing 16 people. Footage shows protesters holding up their lit mobile phones when suddenly there was a swooshing sound, and the crowds started running away. Sonic weapons, which are illegal in Serbia, emit sound waves that can trigger physical and psychological effects, including dizziness, severe headaches, sharp ear pain, disorientation, eardrum ruptures, or even irreversible hearing damage. Serbia's populist president, Aleksandar Vucic, has dismissed the claims as \"lies and fabrications\". Ilic Sunderic, who was at the rally, said it was \"quiet and peaceful and then we heard something we could not see… like a sound rolling toward us\". It was, she said, \"a subdued sound lasting only two to three seconds but very unusual and very frightening, like a sound from hell\". \"I have been going to protests for 30 years, but I've never heard anything like this,\" she added.

The Red Sea, renowned for its coral reefs and marine life, is a major hub for Egypt's crucial tourism industry, in which Russian tourists play an increasingly large part. A United Nations report ranked Egypt first in Africa for tourism revenues in 2024 at $14.1bn (£11bn), more than twice what it earns in Suez Canal revenues, highlighting tourism's vital role in sustaining the hard-pressed economy. However, some tourist companies have stopped or limited travelling on the Red Sea due to the dangers from conflicts in the region. In November, four people drowned and 33 were rescued when a tourist diving boat was struck by high waves and sank within minutes."

The MS-13, or Mara Salvatrucha, is an international criminal gang that was set up in Los Angeles in the 1980s. It was formed by immigrants who had fled El Salvador's civil war to protect Salvadoran immigrants from rival gangs. The group was declared a terrorist organisation by the Trump administration last month. In a Truth Social post, President Trump said: \"Just captured a major leader of MS13\". He did not offer additional details. Mr Trump has previously blamed the gang's growth on lax immigration policies in the US. Ms Bondi told reporters that the suspect was living illegally in the US, around 35 miles (56km) from Washington.

        "Content": " At least 27 people have been killed and dozens injured in South Korea as wildfires continue to rage across the southeast of the country. Thousands of personnel and more than 100 helicopters have been deployed to battle the fires - which officials have described as the worst in the country's history. Historic temples, houses and factories are among the more than 300 buildings and structures that have been destroyed in the fires. Korea Forest Service chief Lim Sang-seop said \"a small amount\" - less than 5 millimetres - of rain was expected in the area on Thursday - not enough to play a meaningful role in extinguishing the wildfires. A pilot whose helicopter crashed during efforts to contain a blaze and four firefighters and other workers who died after being trapped by fast-moving flames driven by strong winds are among those who have been killed. Authorities have not disclosed details of the civilian dead, except that many were in their 60s and 70s. They suspect human error caused several of the wildfires that began last Friday, including cases where people started fires while clearing overgrown grass from family tombs or with sparks during welding work. The wildfires have burned 35,810 hectares (88,488 acres) of land in the southeast, the government's disaster response centre said in a report on Thursday. Observers say it is the worst figure of its kind in South Korea.  The fires have also injured more than 30 people, destroyed about 320 buildings and structures, and forced more than 24,200 people to evacuate. As of Thursday morning, the disaster response centre said authorities were mobilising more than 9,000 people and about 120 helicopters to battle the wildfires.

Last night, strong winds and smoke-filled skies forced authorities in Andong to order evacuations, including in Hahoe Folk Village - a UNESCO World Heritage Site founded around in the 14th-15th centuries. Hikers were advised to leave the scenic Jiri Mountain as another fire spread closer. Officials said earlier this week that firefighters had extinguished most of the flames from the largest wildfires in key areas, but wind and dry conditions allowed them to spread again. In Uiseong, about 20 of the 30 structures at the Gounsa temple complex, which was said to be originally built in the 7th century, were completely burned down. Among them were two state-designated \"treasures\" - a pavilion-shaped building erected overlooking a stream in 1668, and a Joseon dynasty structure built in 1904 to mark the longevity of a king. The Korea Forest Service has raised its wildfire warning to the highest level, requiring local governments to assign more workers to emergency response, tighten entry restrictions for forests and parks, and recommend that military units withhold live-fire exercises."

        "Content": " US immigration authorities have detained and revoked the visa of a Turkish student - accusing her of supporting Hamas. Footage showed masked and plain clothes agents taking 30-year-old Rumeysa Ozturk into custody near her home in Somerville, Massachusetts. The doctoral student, at Tufts University near Boston, had voiced support for Palestinians in Israel's war in Gaza. US Department of Homeland Security (DHS) spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin said in a post on X that DHS and US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) investigations had determined the Turkish national had \"engaged in activities in support of Hamas, a foreign terrorist organization that relishes the killing of Americans\". \"A visa is a privilege not a right,\" she said. \"Glorifying and supporting terrorists who kill Americans is grounds for visa issuance to be terminated,\" she added, giving no further details. Mahsa Khanbabai, the student's lawyer, said in a petition filed in a Boston federal court that Ozturk, who is Muslim, was meeting friends for iftar, a meal that breaks a fast at sunset during Ramadan, when she was detained on Tuesday night. Ms Khanbabai said in a statement: \"We are unaware of her whereabouts and have not been able to contact her.\" She added no charges had been filed against Ozturk \"that we are aware of\". Ozturk was one of four students who wrote an article in a student newspaper last March that criticised Tufts' response to Israel's war on Hamas and attacks in Gaza. A DHS spokesperson confirmed on Wednesday that Ozturk was being detained in Louisiana - despite a judge ordering her not to be moved out of the District of Massachusetts without 48 hours advance notice - and that her student visa had been terminated. It comes after Mahmoud Khalil, a Palestinian graduate student at Columbia University who has held a US permanent residency green card since 2024, was arrested and threatened with deportation earlier this month. 'It looked like a kidnapping' Video of the arrest shows six people with their faces covered approach Ozturk at around 5.30pm on Tuesday, before taking her phone away. The student is seen yelling as she is handcuffed, while one person is heard telling her: \"We're the police.\" A man is heard asking the six \"why are you hiding your faces?\" before the DHS agents lead her away. Michael Mathis, a 32-year-old software engineer whose surveillance camera captured the arrest, told the Associated Press news agency \"it looked like a kidnapping\". He added: \"They approach her and start grabbing her with their faces covered. They're covering their faces. They're in unmarked vehicles.\" Read more: Legal proceedings against Khalil are an American tolerance testHow UK student Gaza protests were handled by police and universities Hundreds of people protested on Wednesday, demanding her release and accusing both Republicans and Democrats of failing to protect immigrants and stand up for Palestinians. \"If you've seen the video clip, it's unfathomable,\" Reyyan Bilge, a friend of Ozturk, said. \"She's walking by herself as a young innocent woman, having nothing to do with any of the complaints... or claims [of antisemitism against students] that have been made. \"There's no reason for any of this. Let alone being discriminatory in any way, or racist or antisemitic in any way, she is an utterly nice soul and a decent person.\"  Sunil Kumar, president of Tufts University, said in a statement that the university \"had no pre-knowledge of this incident and did not share any information with federal authorities prior to the event\". As of Wednesday evening, the ICE's online detainee locator system listed Ozturk as being held at the South Louisiana ICE Processing Center in Basile.

Friends told the Associated Press news agency that Ozturk was not closely involved in pro-Palestinian protests, but that after the article was published, her name, photo and work history were featured by Canary Mission. The website says it documents people who \"promote hatred of the USA, Israel and Jews on North American college campuses\". After her arrest, the Turkish Embassy in Washington said it was keeping in regular contact with the student's family, monitoring the situation closely and engaged in \"initiatives\" with the State Department and ICE."

        "Content": "People in Europe should stockpile three days' worth of food, water and other essentials in case of a crisis, the EU has said. Cyberattacks, climate change, and disease are increasing the chances of an emergency, and the 450 million people living in the 27-nation bloc need to be ready, its preparedness and crisis management commissioner Hadja Lahbib said. As she announced a new strategy for dealing with future disasters on Wednesday, Ms Lahbib said the threats currently facing Europeans \"are more complex than ever, and they are all interconnected\". She said it was important to \"make sure people have essential supplies for at least 72 hours in a crisis\".  World leaders hold Ukraine summit - latest Food, water, torches, ID papers, medicine, and shortwave radios were among the items she said citizens should stock. Similarly, she said the EU itself should build up a \"strategic reserve\" and stockpile other critical resources, including firefighting planes, medical, energy, and transport equipment, as well as specialised assets against chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear threats. \"We can no longer rely on ad hoc reactions,\" Ms Lahbib warned. The warning comes as the EU rethinks its defence and security, especially after the Trump administration warned that Europe must take more responsibility for it. In recent years, the union has weathered COVID-19 and the threat from Russia, including its attempts to exploit Europe's dependence on its natural gas to weaken support for Ukraine.

It included advice on what to do in case of nuclear attack. Not all countries have the same level of crisis preparedness, and the EU Commission also wants to encourage them to coordinate better in case of an emergency."

The 24-year-old suspect from El Salvador was identified as one of the top three leaders in the United States of the street gang, which has a reputation for extreme violence, Pam Bondi said during a news conference after his arrest. She told reporters: \"The bad guy is in jail.\" \"America is safer today because one of the top domestic terrorists in MS-13... is off the streets. \"We want to make our schools safer. We want to make your neighbourhoods safer.

The MS-13, or Mara Salvatrucha, is an international criminal gang that was set up in Los Angeles in the 1980s. It was formed by immigrants who had fled El Salvador's civil war to protect Salvadoran immigrants from rival gangs. The group was declared a terrorist organisation by the Trump administration last month. In a Truth Social post, President Trump said: \"Just captured a major leader of MS13\". He did not offer additional details. Mr Trump has previously blamed the gang's growth on lax immigration policies in the US. Ms Bondi told reporters that the suspect was living illegally in the US, around 35 miles (56km) from Washington. She said the suspect was recruited by the MS-13 at a young age, and led the gang's operation on the East Coast.

        "Content": "\n          Business and economics reporter\n              @taaffems\n Payday banking outages will happen again but are unlikely to occur tomorrow, according to a banking technology expert. Online banking failures on the final Friday of the last two months, payday for many, were seen as millions of customers of different institutions were locked out of accounts or unable to send or receive payments. At the end of January, Barclays experienced problems in branches and online for days, while in February issues - which did not appear to be related - were encountered by Lloyds, Halifax, Nationwide, TSB, Bank of Scotland and First Direct. Money blog: Trump car tariffs condemned around world  Similar outages \"will absolutely happen again\", said Paul Taylor, chief executive of bank technology company Thought Machine, which sells cloud computing solutions to the banking industry. Given the attention generated by the last two paydays, Mr Taylor said his guess is this Friday will be safe as every bank's chief information officer is \"super aware\" of the day and that \"it would be devastating for reputation if anything happened\". The troubles, however, are not unique to the last two paydays but have just been more visible and complained about, Mr Taylor told Sky News. \n                  Nearly 100 Santander UK branches to close - with 750 jobs at risk\n                 \n                  Monument Bank in talks to raise £200m ahead of Nasdaq IPO\n                 \n                  Insurance unicorn Marshmallow finalises fundraising at £1.5bn valuation\n                 \"My guess is that we're talking about visibility, not occurrence. I'm aware of bank problems on paydays for many years.\" Through his job, Mr Taylor said he speaks to a major bank every day and counts Lloyds Banking Group as a client. Why are glitches happening? These issues will continue to arise as lenders grapple with \"creaking infrastructure\", Mr Taylor said. \"The sheer volume of payments can overwhelm the bank, and that's why it's particularly susceptible on this [pay] day\". \"The problem that banks have is that the systems are old and the systems are fragile\", he said. \"One problem causes a knock-on effect, and that knock-on effect ripples through the bank, and then the end result is on payday that the payments don't get made\". Solving the issue is expensive and time-consuming, he added, even for banks that have enjoyed higher profits in recent years, thanks to elevated interest rates.  Many banks are moving to more modern infrastructure, Mr Taylor said, but it takes time and banks don't want to get it wrong. But some are \"so entrenched in this legacy technology\", he said. The UK banks are \"not that bad\" when compared to international competition and each spend billions on IT every year, Mr Taylor caveated. Despite this, no banks contacted by Sky News said glitches wouldn't happen again. What went wrong on paydays? And when banks were asked what caused the glitches last payday, none responded with an explanation. After parts of Barclays were down in January, the phenomenon began being investigated by the influential Treasury Committee of MPs. As part of this, banks were asked to outline the outages they've experienced and why. In the days before the February payday, nine top UK banks told the committee typical reasons for failures included problems with third-party suppliers, disruption caused by systems changes and internal software malfunctions.

What have banks said? TSB and Natwest referred Sky News to the banking lobby group UK Finance, which said it did not know what was behind the past two payday problems. \"The banking industry invests significantly in the resilience of systems and technology,\" UK Finance's managing director of operational resilience David Raw told Sky News. \"The ongoing investment means incidents which cause significant disruption happen very rarely,\" he said \"Incidents can be short in duration, but if an issue does arise the bank will always work extremely hard to rectify it as quickly as possible and minimise the customer impact.\" Santander UK said it was not affected by the last two payday outages. \"We have robust systems in place to ensure that our services remain operational for customers,\" a spokesperson said. \"Since January 2023, our services have been available to customers for 99.9% of the time. When there is a disruption, our priority is to minimise its impact and restore services as quickly as possible and support customers through our alternative channels and ensure that no customer is left out of pocket as a result.\" A spokesperson for HSBC, which also owns First Direct, said: \"We continue to invest in our operational resilience to provide the best possible service for our customers\". \"The end of each month brings increased transaction volumes and heightened demand across the banking services industry, and so we plan accordingly - enhancing system capacity as well as limiting non-essential, back-end system changes and updates.\" Nationwide, The Co-operative Bank, Lloyds - who also own the Halifax and Bank of Scotland brands - did not respond to Sky News's request. Barclays did not comment."

        "Content": "\n          City editor\n              @MarkKleinmanSky\n Britain's second-biggest steel producer is kicking off a consultation that could lead to the closure of its two blast furnaces and more than half of its workforce losing their jobs - a move that will pile pressure on the government to improve an offer of taxpayer aid to the company. Sky News has learnt that British Steel was on Thursday morning in discussions with trade unions about a redundancy process that could result in between 2,000 and 2,500 employees being axed out of a workforce of 3,500. One trade union source said that meetings were taking place on Thursday morning, with a public statement about plans to accelerate the closure of Scunthorpe's two blast furnaces emerging soon after. The company said the consultations related to the closure of the blast furnaces, steelmaking operations and a reduction of steel rolling mill capacity in Scunthorpe. Money latest: Trump car tariffs condemned around the world The launch of the redundancy consultation comes amid an impasse between Jingye Group, British Steel's Chinese owner, over a government subsidy package to aid the company's transition to greener steel production. Sky News revealed on Wednesday that Jingye had this week rejected a £500m offer from the government. \n                  Bank payday outages 'will absolutely happen again', tech expert says\n                 \n                  Boohoo's Debenhams renaming at risk amid Ashley row\n                 \n                  Money blog: Trump car tariffs condemned around world; Tesla takes hit; UK faces big consequences\n                 Sarah Jones, the industry minister, told MPs that talks were continuing, while an urgent question is expected to be answered in the House of Commons on Thursday. The £500m proposal - aimed at facilitating the Scunthorpe-based group's transition to green steel production - follows years of talks aimed at salvaging the future of the UK's second-biggest producer.Its scale is equivalent to the sum awarded to the larger Tata Steel as part of a £1.25bn package finalised last year. Whitehall sources said that Jingye's business plan would involve a smaller number of jobs being cut if a switch to electric arc furnaces took place, with the redundancies also staggered over a longer period. However, the Chinese group has argued that that transition would only be possible with a larger sum of government funding, they added.  In a statement sent to Sky News, the Community union's general secretary, Roy Rickhuss, said: \"This is a dark day for our steel industry and for our country. \"We urge Jingye and the UK Government to get back around the table to resume negotiations before it is too late. \"Cruciallly, Jingye have not ruled out retaining the blast furnaces during a transition to low carbon steelmaking if they can secure the backing of the Government. \"The closures at Scunthorpe would represent a hammer blow to communities which were built on steel, and where the industry still supports thousands of jobs directly and thousands more through extensive supply chains. \"Given that we are now on the cusp of becoming the only G7 country without domestic primary steelmaking capacity, it is no exaggeration to say that our national security is gravely threatened. \"This would be catastrophic at any time, let alone in the current era of geopolitical instability and volatility. Steel is an essential component of defensive infrastructure, just as it is to wider plans to invest in growth across the country.  The rejection of the £500m offer leaves Scunthorpe's future on a knife-edge, although Whitehall sources said that all parties involved in the negotiations were hopeful that a deal could yet be struck. However, the package offered so far falls well short of the sum that Jingye has been seeking from the government during several rounds of talks since Labour won last summer's general election. The Chinese-owned group is thought to have requested £1bn or more from ministers - double the amount handed to Tata Steel, owner of the Port Talbot steelworks in South Wales, last autumn. British Steel, which was taken over by Jingye in 2020 after a spell in public ownership, employs several thousand people at its sites in Scunthorpe, Teesside and elsewhere. It has been pushing for taxpayer funding to support a transition to green steelmaking by replacing Scunthorpe's two blast furnaces with cleaner electric arc furnaces. Reports late last year suggested that nationalisation was an option being explored by ministers.  The government's proposal comes at a deeply sensitive time for Britain's steel industry, with fears of swingeing US tariffs exacerbating concerns that the sector's viability will be put at risk. Last month, Mr Reynolds published the government's Plan for Steel consultation, which will include up to £2.5bn in funding for the industry, in line with a commitment in last year's Labour election manifesto. \"The UK steel industry has a long-term future under this government,\" he said. \"Britain is open for business, and this government has committed up to £2.5bn to the future of steel to protect our industrial heartlands, maintain jobs, and drive growth as part of our Plan for Change.\" During the same month, Mr Reynolds held further talks with Jingye Group's boss, Li Huiming, in the latest chapter of a negotiation which has been dragging on for more than two years. British Steel was bought by Jingye the year after it was placed into compulsory liquidation. The company had been owned by private investment firm Greybull Capital. British Steel CEO, Mr Zengwei An, said: \"We understand this is an extremely difficult day for our staff, their families, and everyone associated with British Steel. \"But we believe this is a necessary decision given the hugely challenging circumstances the business faces. \"We remain committed to engaging with our workforce and unions, as well as our suppliers and customers during this time.\" Business and Trade Secretary Jonathan Reynolds responded: \"I know this will be a deeply worrying time for staff and, while this is British Steel's decision, we will continue working tirelessly to reach an agreement with the company's owners to secure its future and protect taxpayers' money. \"We've been clear there's a bright future for steelmaking in the UK. We've committed up to £2.5bn to rebuild the sector and will soon publish a Plan for Steel setting out how we can achieve a sustainable future for the workforce, industry and local communities.\" Unite general secretary Sharon Graham described the company's move as a \"disgrace\" She said: \"British Steel is guilty of trying to hold the government to ransom, while using its dedicated workforce as pawns... British Steel must now withdraw its job threats and work with the government and Unite on a sustainable way forward which is in the best interests of the workers, their communities and the wider economy.\" Ben Houchen, the Tees Valley Mayor, said of the impact: \"This is devastating for Britain. Losing our ability to make steel in a world as insecure as this is not just short-sighted, it's dangerous. \"We had a serious deal on the table to bring an electric arc furnace to Teesside. It would have secured jobs, attracted investment, and delivered a long-term future for green steelmaking in the UK. For whatever reason, that deal was quietly dropped. Instead, we ended up with unworkable proposals in Scunthorpe that were politically convenient but strategically and economically flawed. \"I've worked constructively with the Labour Government throughout, but I warned them repeatedly: the path they were on would end in collapse. Today, we've seen the result.\""

        "Content": "\n          Political reporter\n              @alexrogerssky\n Labour MPs have expressed concern about potential plans to cut or scrap a tax paid by tech giants to stave off the threat of Donald Trump's tariffs. The chancellor and business secretary have both left the door open to possibly abolishing the 2% levy on the online revenues made in the UK by companies including Facebook, Google, and Amazon. Politics live: Date set for by-election The idea has been mooted as a means to avoid further tariffs from Mr Trump, who has brought in 25% taxes on steel and aluminium imports and signed another executive order yesterday that will affect cars. However, a number of Labour MPs have raised concerns about the optics of reducing or abandoning the tax while cutting benefits for sick and disabled people, as the chancellor confirmed yesterday in her spring statement. Clive Lewis, the Labour MP for Norwich South, told Sky News any potential alterations to the tax - which was introduced in 2020 and raises about £800m annually - would amount to an \"abject dereliction of responsibility\". \"We are rolling out the red carpet for these tech companies, and we are not getting much in return,\" he said. \"If you are going to give tax cuts to some of the wealthiest corporations on the planet just as you have taken billions from welfare - how do you think that is going to look to the public? It's going to look absolutely horrific.\" He added: \"I understand the argument of hugging America close - but this is not the way to do it.\" Read more:Spring statement key takeawaysBacklash over cuts for 'people that need help'  'We should be maximising it' Another Labour MP argued there was \"little appetite in the parliamentary party for any reneging on the digital services tax\". \"As a new revenue line to government at such difficult times, if anything we should be maximising it not minimising it,\" they added. A third backbencher said: \"Unless part of a wider US trade deal that eliminates tariffs and delivers a net boost to the economy - which is more than the revenue of that tax - changing the digital services tax should not be considered.\" 'Slam dunk' However, some experts have suggested axing the tax could ultimately pay off it means the US leaves the UK out of its tariff regime or a beneficial trade deal is struck. Tax expert Dan Neidle branded the tax \"unprincipled\", as it raises less than £1bn. \"If the government can negotiate more than £1bn in benefits from the US, then it's a slam dunk,\" he said. Ministers have so far not committed to changing the tax but have left the door open to doing so as the government seeks to strike a favourable trade deal with the US. While details of what could be included in the deal - mooted by Keir Starmer and Mr Trump during their meeting in Washington last month - remain light, AI and technology could form part of it. Bloomberg recently reported the UK has told the US it could become a European hub for American companies' data centres, outside EU regulation.  Chancellor wants 'to get balance right' Last week, Rachel Reeves did not rule out changing the digital services tax in exchange for exemptions from US tariffs, telling the BBC: \"We've got to get the balance right, and those discussions at the moment are ongoing. \"We want to make progress. We do not want to see British exporters subject to higher tariffs.\" She was echoed by Business Secretary Jonathan Reynolds, who said today the tax \"was not something that can never change\". He pointed to the fact the tax was introduced as a temporary measure, brought in by Rishi Sunak over concerns multinational tech giants making money in the UK were shifting their profits overseas. The UK was due to phase out the tax three years ago, but this has not yet happened."

The furore, which claimed the scalp of NatWest's former chief executive Dame Alison Rose in 2023, centred on whether the bank's Coutts subsidiary closed Mr Farage's accounts for commercial or political reasons.

        "Content": "\n          Political reporter\n              @alexrogerssky\n  Sir Keir Starmer has vowed to \"keep all options on the table\" after Donald Trump imposed a \"very concerning\" 25% tariff on all imported cars into the US. The president signed an executive order on Wednesday for the tax to kick in on 2 April - what he has called \"liberation day\". The move ratchets up the global trade war that Mr Trump promised he would ignite upon entering the White House for a second term. Speaking in Paris on Thursday, the prime minister described the tariffs as \"very concerning\" and said the UK \"will keep all options on the table\" and \"put the national interest first\". \"I think we need to keep, as ever, pragmatic and clear eyed. We are engaged, as you know, in intense discussions with the US on economic arrangements, on a number of fronts, including to mitigate tariffs,\" the prime minister said. \"We will continue in that way because I think that, rather than jumping into a trade war, it is better pragmatically to come to an agreed way forward on this if we can.\" Earlier, Chancellor Rachel Reeves told Wilfred Frost on Sky News Breakfast that the UK does not want to \"escalate\" Mr Trump's trade wars. Politics latest: Treasury minister under fire for 'spicy' briefing  She said: \"We're not at the moment in a position where we want to do anything to escalate these trade wars. \"Trade wars are no good for anyone. It will end up with higher prices for consumers pushing up inflation after we've worked so hard to get a grip of inflation, and at the same time, will make it harder for British companies to export. \"So look, we are looking to secure a better trading relationship with the United States. I recognise that the week ahead is important. \"There are further talks going on today, so let's see where we get to in the next few days.\" The chancellor's answer does leave the door open to the UK potentially responding to the US president's actions, which risks a huge impact for the UK's car industry including manufacturers such as Jaguar Land Rover, Aston Martin and Rolls-Royce. However, the UK government has sought to maintain a positive relationship with Mr Trump in a bid to avoid further punitive tariffs that he maintains are necessary to grow the US economy by boosting domestic manufacturing and protecting jobs. The president has already imposed tariffs on all steel and aluminium imports to the US, which came into effect on 12 March. The move has affected UK products worth hundreds of millions of pounds.  While the European Union has announced it will impose retaliatory tariffs on the US, UK ministers have only said they are \"disappointed\" to see the tariffs on steel and aluminium and that \"all options are on the table\". Business Secretary Jonathan Reynolds previously said there would be no immediate retaliation by the UK government as negotiations continue over a wider trade deal with the US. A lucrative trade deal with the US is all the more pertinent for Ms Reeves after she admitted during her spring statement that the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) had halved the UK growth forecast for 2025 from 2% to 1%. However, the fiscal watchdog said that while growth had been downgraded for this year, it had been upgraded for every year after for the rest of this parliament - which is due to end in 2029. Living standards, as measured by household disposable income, will fall after this year to almost no growth in 2027-28 before rising again due to firms rebuilding profit margins, wage growth slowing, taxes rising, and welfare measures taking effect. Read more:Spring statement 2025 key takeawaysHow will Trump's tariffs affect UK? The chancellor said on Wednesday that she was \"not satisfied with the numbers\" for this year. During the statement, Ms Reeves said she had restored the government's £9.9bn fiscal \"headroom\" - the room she has to spend money before she breaks her fiscal rules. However, the OBR has warned this could easily be jeopardised by global events. \"If global trade disputes escalate to include 20 percentage point rises in tariffs between the USA and the rest of the world, this could reduce UK GDP by a peak of 1% and reduce the current surplus in the target year to almost zero,\" it warned."

        "Content": "\n          Political correspondent\n              @wizbates\n  Chancellor Rachel Reeves delivered her spring statement this week. Now we've heard the detail we've picked out three key policy areas from Labour's plan for change - health, growth and housing - and asked three experts to give their verdict. Here's their view on how the government is doing so far: Politics latest: Follow live updates The pledge: Ending hospital backlogs to meet the NHS standard of 92% of patients in England waiting no longer than 18 weeks for elective treatment. The expert: Matthew Taylor, chief executive of the NHS Confederation The verdict: \n                  'Child poverty will increase for first time under Labour and it's paving way for Reform', Corbyn warns Starmer\n                 \n                  'Why would they target that?': Backlash over welfare cuts on 'people that need extra help'\n                 \n                  Lower-income households set to be £500 poorer after chancellor's spring statement - thinktank\n                 I think the critical thing was the financially challenging environment we find ourselves in is going to be even more challenging next year and the year after. So, we're talking about an unprecedented squeeze on the overall amount of money available to the health service. The NHS leaders I represent are having to make cuts of 6%, 7%, 8% in their overall budgets, but they know now that the year after and the year after that are going to be even tougher.  How about NHS modernisation? If we don't do things differently, I fear what we'll see is what we've seen in the past, which is more money going into acute hospitals. This is the most expensive, least effective way of providing healthcare. Rather, more money should be going into primary, into community. So we really have to accelerate the reform process if we're going to be able to get more with less. The score: 7/10 …but we're waiting for a 10-year plan, and until we really know what the plan is, it's very difficult to judge. The pledge: Raising living standards in every part of the United Kingdom, so working people have more money in their pocket as we aim to deliver the highest sustained growth in the G7. The expert: Praful Nargund, director and founder of the Good Growth Foundation The verdict: In the short term, it's still very hard for the economy. I mean, you're looking at the OBR downgrading growth, halving their growth estimate for this year. You have a better picture longer term. You see the housing and planning reforms, meaning gains in productivity and growth. You're seeing household disposable income potentially rise at the end of the parliament by £500 per household. What about the cost of living? People want to see change more quickly. They want to see benefits more quickly from an economy changing. Also, we're far too exposed to volatility and instability in the world, especially with Trump tariffs coming down the line. The score: 7/10 Long term some really good reforms are coming. Short term we want to see a whole government approach to getting growth happening very soon.  The pledge: Building 1.5 million homes in England and fast-tracking planning decisions on at least 150 major economic infrastructure projects - more than the last 14 years combined. The expert: Clare Miller, chief executive at Clarion Housing Group The verdict: There was the announcement from the chancellor that she's putting an extra £2bn of capital investment into the affordable homes programme. Investment in that area will enable us to be able to build more homes. However, it's not a silver bullet. And clearly what we need is a long-term solution in order to enable charitable housing associations like my own, and to be able to work with the government to deliver over the longer term. What do you think about leasehold properties? What the government would like to do is to move to a common hold form of tenure, which potentially gives the residents living in those blocks more control and more say over the services that are delivered to those residents. I think that that is a positive step. But we will have to see how it is rolled out. The score: ??? Forgive me for not giving a mark out of 10 at this stage, because I think we have only seen the first steps."

Overall, there was a 2.9% decrease in the number of sewage spills last year compared to 2023, according to water company data collected and analysed by the Environment Agency. Despite this small improvement in the number of events, the duration of spills - the amount of time a water treatment plant discharges untreated sewage into a river or the sea - increased by 0.2%. \"This year's data shows we are still a long way off where we need to be to stop unnecessary sewage pollution,\" said Alan Lovell, chair of the Environment Agency. The EA says it has secured £10.2bn from water companies to reduce sewage dumping. \"While these improvements get under way, we expect water companies to do what customers pay it to do: ensure their existing assets are maintained and operating properly,\" said Mr Lovell. 'Stark reminder' \n                  Three quarters of a million pieces of rubbish found on UK beaches\n                 \n                  An abundance of marine life - but the wildlife of the Falkland Islands is more vulnerable than most\n                 \n                  New planning bill could be the government's most important - but will it work in practice?\n                 The latest data is bad, if not unexpected news, for the government. \"These figures are disgraceful and are a stark reminder of how years of underinvestment have led to water companies discharging unacceptable levels of sewage into our rivers, lakes and seas,\" said Environment Secretary Steve Reed.  The government says part of its £100bn public infrastructure investment plans will address water pollution. But repairing or replacing thousands of miles of ageing water pipes and dilapidated water treatment works, as well as building new ones, is expected to take decades. This year, it also introduced the Water (Special Measures) Act which it said it would use to get \"tough\" on water companies. The bill allows for the banning of bonuses for water company bosses failing to meet targets and allows criminal charges to be brought against companies in breach of the law. The government, however, may soon find itself in the stink. Read more from Sky News:BAFTA TV Awards nominations revealedPair held in probe into vandalism at Trump golf resort Last week, environment watchdog the Office for Environmental Protection (OEP) announced it was launching an investigation into whether proposed plans from the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA) to clean up waterways are in breach of the law. The OEP is to decide whether DEFRA's plans, implemented by the Environment Agency and the water regulator Ofwat, are too generic and fail to address the environmental risk of sewage pollution at particular sites. England, for example, is home to the majority of the world's chalk stream rivers and streams that are particularly sensitive to sewage pollution. 'Still broken' For clean water campaigners, the latest data is just more of the same. \"The water industry is still broken,\" said James Wallace, chief executive of River Action. He added: \"The numbers are staggering: over 3.6 million hours of sewage spills from almost 450,000 discharges. \"That's equivalent to 412 continuous years of sewage polluting our rivers, lakes and seas.\" The frustration for consumers is that many of us will see significant increases to our bills in order to finance the investments being demanded by Ofwat and the government to meet pollution targets. Last year, an independent Water Commission was launched by the government. Led by Sir Jon Cunliffe, it is charged with coming up with long-term reforms for the way water companies are regulated. The commission should look at the structure and ownership of water companies themselves, according to campaigners. \"[It] must put an end to this failed privatisation experiment and force real reform of the industry and regulators,\" said Mr Wallace. \"We need to learn from our European neighbours, and use finance and governance models that put people and nature before investors.\""

        "Content": "\n          Political reporter\n              @alexrogerssky\n  Sir Keir Starmer has vowed to \"keep all options on the table\" after Donald Trump imposed a \"very concerning\" 25% tariff on all imported cars into the US. The president signed an executive order on Wednesday for the tax to kick in on 2 April - what he has called \"liberation day\". The move ratchets up the global trade war that Mr Trump promised he would ignite upon entering the White House for a second term. Speaking in Paris on Thursday, the prime minister described the tariffs as \"very concerning\" and said the UK \"will keep all options on the table\" and \"put the national interest first\". \"I think we need to keep, as ever, pragmatic and clear eyed. We are engaged, as you know, in intense discussions with the US on economic arrangements, on a number of fronts, including to mitigate tariffs,\" the prime minister said. \"We will continue in that way because I think that, rather than jumping into a trade war, it is better pragmatically to come to an agreed way forward on this if we can.\" Earlier, Chancellor Rachel Reeves told Wilfred Frost on Sky News Breakfast that the UK does not want to \"escalate\" Mr Trump's trade wars. Politics latest: Treasury minister under fire for 'spicy' briefing  She said: \"We're not at the moment in a position where we want to do anything to escalate these trade wars. \"Trade wars are no good for anyone. It will end up with higher prices for consumers pushing up inflation after we've worked so hard to get a grip of inflation, and at the same time, will make it harder for British companies to export. \"So look, we are looking to secure a better trading relationship with the United States. I recognise that the week ahead is important. \"There are further talks going on today, so let's see where we get to in the next few days.\" The chancellor's answer does leave the door open to the UK potentially responding to the US president's actions, which risks a huge impact for the UK's car industry including manufacturers such as Jaguar Land Rover, Aston Martin and Rolls-Royce. However, the UK government has sought to maintain a positive relationship with Mr Trump in a bid to avoid further punitive tariffs that he maintains are necessary to grow the US economy by boosting domestic manufacturing and protecting jobs. The president has already imposed tariffs on all steel and aluminium imports to the US, which came into effect on 12 March. The move has affected UK products worth hundreds of millions of pounds.  While the European Union has announced it will impose retaliatory tariffs on the US, UK ministers have only said they are \"disappointed\" to see the tariffs on steel and aluminium and that \"all options are on the table\". Business Secretary Jonathan Reynolds previously said there would be no immediate retaliation by the UK government as negotiations continue over a wider trade deal with the US. A lucrative trade deal with the US is all the more pertinent for Ms Reeves after she admitted during her spring statement that the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) had halved the UK growth forecast for 2025 from 2% to 1%. However, the fiscal watchdog said that while growth had been downgraded for this year, it had been upgraded for every year after for the rest of this parliament - which is due to end in 2029. Living standards, as measured by household disposable income, will fall after this year to almost no growth in 2027-28 before rising again due to firms rebuilding profit margins, wage growth slowing, taxes rising, and welfare measures taking effect. Read more:Spring statement 2025 key takeawaysHow will Trump's tariffs affect UK? The chancellor said on Wednesday that she was \"not satisfied with the numbers\" for this year. During the statement, Ms Reeves said she had restored the government's £9.9bn fiscal \"headroom\" - the room she has to spend money before she breaks her fiscal rules. However, the OBR has warned this could easily be jeopardised by global events. \"If global trade disputes escalate to include 20 percentage point rises in tariffs between the USA and the rest of the world, this could reduce UK GDP by a peak of 1% and reduce the current surplus in the target year to almost zero,\" it warned."

A joint statement signed by former Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn and other cross-party MPs calls for a wealth tax on those with assets over £10m \"so we can rebuild our schools and hospitals\". Politics Live: Protesters interrupt minister's speech The letter, in response to Rachel Reeves's spring statement, says the chancellor has made a \"choice\" to push more disabled people and children into poverty by announcing departmental spending cuts while increasing money invested into defence. \"This isn't about scarcity, it's about priorities\", it said, adding: \"This is set to be the first Labour government in history under which child poverty increases. \"Labour's failure has paved the way for Reform.

It comes ahead of the launch of Reform UK's local election campaign on Friday, with the party hoping to make gains in May after overtaking Labour in multiple polls. The letter describes the \"alternative path\" as one where the richest in society and multinational companies face higher taxes, rent controls are brought in, water and energy are nationalised and money is invested \"in welfare, not warfare\". These measures have previously been ruled out by Ms Reeves, but she is coming under pressure following her spring statement on Wednesday. Spring statement takeaways The economic update included a £2.2bn increase in defence spending over the next year to help the government reach its goal of spending 2.5% of GDP on defence by 2027. The chancellor also deepened previously announced welfare cuts alongside further departmental spending reductions to make up for £10bn in lost fiscal headroom since her October budget, caused by poor growth and global instability. The government's own impact assessment estimates another 250,000 people - including 50,000 children - could be pushed into relative poverty by 2030 because of the measures. However Ms Reeves said that assessment did not take into account steps the government was taking to get people back into work. She has also rejected a separate analysis that suggests the average family could be £1,400 a year worse off by the end of the decade. Labour MPs unhappy  Several Labour MPs have spoken out against the cuts and some have said they will vote against them. However Ms Reeves is believed to have staved off a full-scale rebellion for now, as most trust she is serious about getting the nation's finances back on track. Read More:Backlash over welfare cutsCorbyn brands benefit cuts a 'disgrace'  The chancellor is determined to stick to her self-imposed fiscal rules, including using tax receipts rather than borrowing to account for day-to-day spending. However she may come under pressure to change course if global factors like Donald Trump's trade war eat into her fiscal headroom again by the time of the next budget in October - meaning she would have to raise taxes or announce further spending cuts in order to balance the books. The Institute for Fiscal Studies has warned tax rises are likely in the autumn as Ms Reeves has left herself vulnerable to forecast changes, speculating that pensioners and the wealthiest could be targeted in the raid. Earlier this week, a YouGov poll found three quarters of the British public would support tax rises on the very richest over expected cuts to public spending, including a 2% wealth tax on net assets worth more than £10m."

        "Content": "\n          Political correspondent\n              @wizbates\n  Chancellor Rachel Reeves delivered her spring statement this week. Now we've heard the detail we've picked out three key policy areas from Labour's plan for change - health, growth and housing - and asked three experts to give their verdict. Here's their view on how the government is doing so far: Politics latest: Follow live updates The pledge: Ending hospital backlogs to meet the NHS standard of 92% of patients in England waiting no longer than 18 weeks for elective treatment. The expert: Matthew Taylor, chief executive of the NHS Confederation The verdict: \n                  'Child poverty will increase for first time under Labour and it's paving way for Reform', Corbyn warns Starmer\n                 \n                  'Why would they target that?': Backlash over welfare cuts on 'people that need extra help'\n                 \n                  Lower-income households set to be £500 poorer after chancellor's spring statement - thinktank\n                 I think the critical thing was the financially challenging environment we find ourselves in is going to be even more challenging next year and the year after. So, we're talking about an unprecedented squeeze on the overall amount of money available to the health service. The NHS leaders I represent are having to make cuts of 6%, 7%, 8% in their overall budgets, but they know now that the year after and the year after that are going to be even tougher.  How about NHS modernisation? If we don't do things differently, I fear what we'll see is what we've seen in the past, which is more money going into acute hospitals. This is the most expensive, least effective way of providing healthcare. Rather, more money should be going into primary, into community. So we really have to accelerate the reform process if we're going to be able to get more with less. The score: 7/10 …but we're waiting for a 10-year plan, and until we really know what the plan is, it's very difficult to judge. The pledge: Raising living standards in every part of the United Kingdom, so working people have more money in their pocket as we aim to deliver the highest sustained growth in the G7. The expert: Praful Nargund, director and founder of the Good Growth Foundation The verdict: In the short term, it's still very hard for the economy. I mean, you're looking at the OBR downgrading growth, halving their growth estimate for this year. You have a better picture longer term. You see the housing and planning reforms, meaning gains in productivity and growth. You're seeing household disposable income potentially rise at the end of the parliament by £500 per household. What about the cost of living? People want to see change more quickly. They want to see benefits more quickly from an economy changing. Also, we're far too exposed to volatility and instability in the world, especially with Trump tariffs coming down the line. The score: 7/10 Long term some really good reforms are coming. Short term we want to see a whole government approach to getting growth happening very soon.  The pledge: Building 1.5 million homes in England and fast-tracking planning decisions on at least 150 major economic infrastructure projects - more than the last 14 years combined. The expert: Clare Miller, chief executive at Clarion Housing Group The verdict: There was the announcement from the chancellor that she's putting an extra £2bn of capital investment into the affordable homes programme. Investment in that area will enable us to be able to build more homes. However, it's not a silver bullet. And clearly what we need is a long-term solution in order to enable charitable housing associations like my own, and to be able to work with the government to deliver over the longer term. What do you think about leasehold properties? What the government would like to do is to move to a common hold form of tenure, which potentially gives the residents living in those blocks more control and more say over the services that are delivered to those residents. I think that that is a positive step. But we will have to see how it is rolled out. The score: ??? Forgive me for not giving a mark out of 10 at this stage, because I think we have only seen the first steps."

The chancellor and business secretary have both left the door open to possibly abolishing the 2% levy on the online revenues made in the UK by companies including Facebook, Google, and Amazon. Politics live: Date set for by-election The idea has been mooted as a means to avoid further tariffs from Mr Trump, who has brought in 25% taxes on steel and aluminium imports and signed another executive order yesterday that will affect cars. However, a number of Labour MPs have raised concerns about the optics of reducing or abandoning the tax while cutting benefits for sick and disabled people, as the chancellor confirmed yesterday in her spring statement. Clive Lewis, the Labour MP for Norwich South, told Sky News any potential alterations to the tax - which was introduced in 2020 and raises about £800m annually - would amount to an \"abject dereliction of responsibility\". \"We are rolling out the red carpet for these tech companies, and we are not getting much in return,\" he said. \"If you are going to give tax cuts to some of the wealthiest corporations on the planet just as you have taken billions from welfare - how do you think that is going to look to the public? It's going to look absolutely horrific.\" He added: \"I understand the argument of hugging America close - but this is not the way to do it.\" Read more:Spring statement key takeawaysBacklash over cuts for 'people that need help'  'We should be maximising it' Another Labour MP argued there was \"little appetite in the parliamentary party for any reneging on the digital services tax\". \"As a new revenue line to government at such difficult times, if anything we should be maximising it not minimising it,\" they added. A third backbencher said: \"Unless part of a wider US trade deal that eliminates tariffs and delivers a net boost to the economy - which is more than the revenue of that tax - changing the digital services tax should not be considered.\" 'Slam dunk' However, some experts have suggested axing the tax could ultimately pay off it means the US leaves the UK out of its tariff regime or a beneficial trade deal is struck. Tax expert Dan Neidle branded the tax \"unprincipled\", as it raises less than £1bn. \"If the government can negotiate more than £1bn in benefits from the US, then it's a slam dunk,\" he said. Ministers have so far not committed to changing the tax but have left the door open to doing so as the government seeks to strike a favourable trade deal with the US.

Shortly after Sky News revealed the Reform UK leader has settled the dispute, Mr Farage said he was \"caught in the crossfire\" of identity politics. City editor Mark Kleinman reported on Wednesday that a deal had been reached nearly two years after the closure of Mr Farage's accounts, which led to the resignation of the bank's boss. Politics latest: Follow live updates Nick Candy, Reform UK's treasurer, played a key role in resolving the dispute between the two sides during six hours of mediation talks held at a London law firm on Tuesday. Under the deal, the bank has agreed to pay Mr Farage damages, while he is understood to have withdrawn a threat of potential civil and criminal proceedings against NatWest. Mr Farage said: \"The war with NatWest is finally over. I thank my friend Nick Candy for sorting that out for me.\" \n                  Farage and NatWest agree to settle debanking dispute\n                 \n                  Nigel Farage would turn UK into a 'Trump tribute act', Lib Dem leader Sir Ed Davey says\n                 \n                  Rupert Lowe says Reform leader Nigel Farage 'must never be PM' in latest attack amid leaks of WhatsApp messages\n                 The Reform UK leader refused to reveal details of the settlement or how much compensation he will receive, but reflected on the dispute when questioned about it by Sky News. \"I think a woke virus has gone through corporate America and corporate Britain,\" he said. \"We have firms like BP pretending they're all about renewable energy rather than producing oil.\" 'Lunacies of DEI policy' Mr Farage hit out at \"the lunacies of DEI (diversity, equity and inclusion) policy, of employing people on the basis of their colour, or their chosen sexuality\". \"I was caught in the crossfire,\" he said. Claiming DEI was coming to an end, he added: \"We're seeing the tide turning. You know, when even Mark Zuckerberg announces that he's axing the DEI department at Meta, you know that a big change is coming. \"And we're moving more towards a system based on meritocracy than based on identity.\" 👉Listen to Politics at Sam and Anne's on your podcast app👈 Although he said he was delighted his war with NatWest was over, Mr Farage criticised Conservative and Labour ministers for failing to legislate to outlaw debanking. He said former Treasury minister Andrew Griffith, now the shadow business and trade secretary, had promised him the Conservatives would put legislation in place. But he said that after former prime minister Rishi Sunak called a general election last year, it had not happened. And attacking financial regulators, he said: \"The Financial Conduct Authority was set up to protect people, but it hasn't lifted a finger to stop people being de-banked.\" Read more from Sky News:Spring statement 2025 key takeawaysHow will Trump's tariffs affect UK? Confirming the settlement to Sky News on Wednesday, Mr Farage and NatWest said in a joint statement: \"NatWest Group and Nigel Farage MP are pleased to confirm that they have resolved and settled their dispute, and the bank has apologised to Mr Farage. The terms of settlement are confidential.\" Mr Farage was originally expected to seek millions of pounds from the company, alleging that the debanking row had damaged his reputation. The furore, which claimed the scalp of NatWest's former chief executive Dame Alison Rose in 2023, centred on whether the bank's Coutts subsidiary closed Mr Farage's accounts for commercial or political reasons. NatWest initially claimed the motivation was commercial, before Mr Farage obtained internal evidence from the bank suggesting his political views had been a pivotal factor in the decision."

        "Content": "\n          Political reporter\n              @alexrogerssky\n Labour MPs have expressed concern about potential plans to cut or scrap a tax paid by tech giants to stave off the threat of Donald Trump's tariffs. The chancellor and business secretary have both left the door open to possibly abolishing the 2% levy on the online revenues made in the UK by companies including Facebook, Google, and Amazon. Politics live: Date set for by-election The idea has been mooted as a means to avoid further tariffs from Mr Trump, who has brought in 25% taxes on steel and aluminium imports and signed another executive order yesterday that will affect cars. However, a number of Labour MPs have raised concerns about the optics of reducing or abandoning the tax while cutting benefits for sick and disabled people, as the chancellor confirmed yesterday in her spring statement. Clive Lewis, the Labour MP for Norwich South, told Sky News any potential alterations to the tax - which was introduced in 2020 and raises about £800m annually - would amount to an \"abject dereliction of responsibility\". \"We are rolling out the red carpet for these tech companies, and we are not getting much in return,\" he said. \"If you are going to give tax cuts to some of the wealthiest corporations on the planet just as you have taken billions from welfare - how do you think that is going to look to the public? It's going to look absolutely horrific.\" He added: \"I understand the argument of hugging America close - but this is not the way to do it.\" Read more:Spring statement key takeawaysBacklash over cuts for 'people that need help'  'We should be maximising it' Another Labour MP argued there was \"little appetite in the parliamentary party for any reneging on the digital services tax\". \"As a new revenue line to government at such difficult times, if anything we should be maximising it not minimising it,\" they added. A third backbencher said: \"Unless part of a wider US trade deal that eliminates tariffs and delivers a net boost to the economy - which is more than the revenue of that tax - changing the digital services tax should not be considered.\" 'Slam dunk' However, some experts have suggested axing the tax could ultimately pay off it means the US leaves the UK out of its tariff regime or a beneficial trade deal is struck. Tax expert Dan Neidle branded the tax \"unprincipled\", as it raises less than £1bn. \"If the government can negotiate more than £1bn in benefits from the US, then it's a slam dunk,\" he said. Ministers have so far not committed to changing the tax but have left the door open to doing so as the government seeks to strike a favourable trade deal with the US. While details of what could be included in the deal - mooted by Keir Starmer and Mr Trump during their meeting in Washington last month - remain light, AI and technology could form part of it.

        "Content": "\n          Science and technology editor\n              @t0mclark3\n The amount of sewage being dumped into English rivers remains \"disgraceful\", despite improved monitoring, supposed investment by water companies and threats of penalties from government, the latest data reveals. Overall, there was a 2.9% decrease in the number of sewage spills last year compared to 2023, according to water company data collected and analysed by the Environment Agency. Despite this small improvement in the number of events, the duration of spills - the amount of time a water treatment plant discharges untreated sewage into a river or the sea - increased by 0.2%. \"This year's data shows we are still a long way off where we need to be to stop unnecessary sewage pollution,\" said Alan Lovell, chair of the Environment Agency. The EA says it has secured £10.2bn from water companies to reduce sewage dumping. \"While these improvements get under way, we expect water companies to do what customers pay it to do: ensure their existing assets are maintained and operating properly,\" said Mr Lovell. 'Stark reminder' \n                  Three quarters of a million pieces of rubbish found on UK beaches\n                 \n                  An abundance of marine life - but the wildlife of the Falkland Islands is more vulnerable than most\n                 \n                  New planning bill could be the government's most important - but will it work in practice?\n                 The latest data is bad, if not unexpected news, for the government. \"These figures are disgraceful and are a stark reminder of how years of underinvestment have led to water companies discharging unacceptable levels of sewage into our rivers, lakes and seas,\" said Environment Secretary Steve Reed.  The government says part of its £100bn public infrastructure investment plans will address water pollution. But repairing or replacing thousands of miles of ageing water pipes and dilapidated water treatment works, as well as building new ones, is expected to take decades. This year, it also introduced the Water (Special Measures) Act which it said it would use to get \"tough\" on water companies. The bill allows for the banning of bonuses for water company bosses failing to meet targets and allows criminal charges to be brought against companies in breach of the law. The government, however, may soon find itself in the stink. Read more from Sky News:BAFTA TV Awards nominations revealedPair held in probe into vandalism at Trump golf resort Last week, environment watchdog the Office for Environmental Protection (OEP) announced it was launching an investigation into whether proposed plans from the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA) to clean up waterways are in breach of the law. The OEP is to decide whether DEFRA's plans, implemented by the Environment Agency and the water regulator Ofwat, are too generic and fail to address the environmental risk of sewage pollution at particular sites. England, for example, is home to the majority of the world's chalk stream rivers and streams that are particularly sensitive to sewage pollution. 'Still broken' For clean water campaigners, the latest data is just more of the same. \"The water industry is still broken,\" said James Wallace, chief executive of River Action. He added: \"The numbers are staggering: over 3.6 million hours of sewage spills from almost 450,000 discharges. \"That's equivalent to 412 continuous years of sewage polluting our rivers, lakes and seas.\" The frustration for consumers is that many of us will see significant increases to our bills in order to finance the investments being demanded by Ofwat and the government to meet pollution targets. Last year, an independent Water Commission was launched by the government. Led by Sir Jon Cunliffe, it is charged with coming up with long-term reforms for the way water companies are regulated. The commission should look at the structure and ownership of water companies themselves, according to campaigners. \"[It] must put an end to this failed privatisation experiment and force real reform of the industry and regulators,\" said Mr Wallace. \"We need to learn from our European neighbours, and use finance and governance models that put people and nature before investors.\""

        "Content": "UK greenhouse gas emissions fell by 3.5% last year compared with 2023, according to provisional government figures. The Energy Department (DESNZ) said climate-warming emissions generated in the UK were 371.4 million tonnes of carbon equivalent in 2024. That's down from 385 million tonnes in 2023 and 406 million tonnes in 2022. The latest figure is 54% lower than in 1990. As a signatory to the 2015 Paris Agreement, the UK is aiming to reduce emissions by 68% by 2030 and 81% by 2035 compared with 1990 levels. The aim is to get to net-zero by 2050, meaning Britain would no longer be adding to the total amount of gases in the atmosphere. DESNZ said the fall was largely due to reductions from the electricity supply and industry sectors, which made up 10% and 13% of emissions respectively. \n                  Shell's new strategy is good news for your savings\n                 \n                  Climate action will make British people 'more secure', says UK envoy, after Badenoch claimed it would hit living standards\n                 \n                  Fresh evidence of global warming - as politicians question climate action\n                 Electricity supply drove the largest share of the reduction, as more electricity imports and increased renewable generation led to lower gas and coal use in power stations. The UK's last coal-fired power station, Ratcliffe-on-Soar in Nottinghamshire, actually closed at the end of September. Domestic transport was the biggest emitter in 2024, added DESNZ, making up 30% of total emissions. However, it was down 1.5% on the previous year. Emissions in the building and product use sector - already the UK's second-largest emitter, making up 21% of the total - increased by 2.3%. Notably, last year was a record for renewable energy generation, such as wind and solar. It was the source of 50.8% of the UK's electricity in 2024, up from 46.4%, according to DESNZ. It's the first year renewables have exceeded 50%.  Read more:Badenoch: Net zero by 2050 'impossible' Jane Cooper, RenewableUK's deputy chief executive, said: \"These new figures show the pace at which our energy system is changing, benefiting billpayers and the climate. \"The UK is moving away rapidly from fossil fuels to low-cost renewables which bring down consumer bills, with wind providing the bulk of our clean power.\" Doug Parr, Greenpeace UK's policy director, said it showed \"the UK's efforts to tackle climate change are working\". However, he said that \"while emissions are falling, we're still very much dependent on expensive and polluting gas for our energy\". \"The government must put a stop to the great gas rip-off and rapidly make renewables the backbone of our energy system to lower our bills for good,\" Mr Parr added."

        "Content": "\n          Royal correspondent\n              @SkyRhiannon\n  There aren't many people who could greet Prince William by cheekily saying \"great hair\", but Kaleb Cooper, one of the most famous names in British farming right now, got away with it as he joined William to talk about the state of the industry. Kaleb, star of the Amazon Prime series Clarkson's Farm, joined William to talk to young farmers about their challenges and mental health, and shared with Sky News his thoughts on the pressures facing the community right now. He told Prince William: \"I think there's a worry with everyone about where they see farming in 10 years' time and I always say, 'don't forget we always need a farmer three times a day, breakfast, dinner and tea'.\" Later he told Sky News: \"I've always said farmers are really good problem solvers. And yes, okay, they may solve the problem. But then at the end of the day, they take that on board themselves. That's where the stress comes from, and that's why mental health occurs in the farming industry a lot. So it's good to talk about it.\" With almost three million followers on Instagram, he regularly uses his platform to highlight where help is available. Kaleb was joined by Charlie Ireland, a land agent who also features on the show, at the event - the first organised for young farmers on the Duchy of Cornwall, of which Prince William is now in charge as heir to the throne. Sky News revealed earlier this week that some in the farming community believe the Prince has a \"duty\" to speak out more on behalf of farmers as they're currently at loggerheads with the government. \n                  Bird flu detected in sheep in England for the first time\n                 \n                  'Shattering blow' to farmers over pause to environmental payment scheme\n                 \n                  Labour MP goes public to oppose family farms tax - and more could follow\n                 But while William is constrained by his role, Kaleb and Charlie can use their new profiles to say more. Speaking on the day of Labour's spending review, Charlie said: \"We've got turbulent times in the economy. Farming is picked up in that. We've had changes. The cash flows are tight on farms. Cash flows are tight in the government - we're feeling that within farming. \"The risk in farming - it's been amplified by about three and a half fold in the last decade because of inflationary pressures. So the risk-reward is now much narrower in certain sectors. That doesn't help people's sort of state of mind because there is a huge amount more pressure out in the fields.\" Read more:Prince William meets Estonia's president amid Russian tensionsMisconduct claims at Prince Harry charity 'a surprise', says trustee Kaleb also described the day-to-day issues in farming: \"It can be whatever the politics are going on in terms of day-to-day or it could be the weather. There's so many different things that are changing as well - it could be a new disease that comes up for a crop, it could be a new disease that comes around for an animal or a chicken. \"It's so many challenges that every farm has got to deal with.\" Sharing one of his secrets to getting farmers talking, Kaleb revealed a brainwave he had at one get-together - darts: \"I started talking to these farmers. They wouldn't open up and I went,'I'm going to get a game of darts going'. \"All of a sudden, every single farmer joined me on the dart board. And everyone started talking openly.\" Throughout the event Kaleb and Charlie were constantly followed by camera crews which means Prince William will appear in a series of Clarkson's Farm in the future. Whether Kaleb will take Prince George's advice, as passed on by his dad, to not swear so much is less certain."
