        "Headline": "Israel denies it is responsible for shortages of food - but aid groups have accused its government of creating \"chaos, starvation, and death\".",
        "Content": " The chief of the World Health Organization (WHO) has said Gaza is suffering \"man-made mass starvation\" because of an Israeli blockade on aid to the enclave. Director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said at a news conference that the population of Gaza is \"facing yet another killer on top of bombs and bullets - starvation\". The WHO said a \"deadly surge\" in malnutrition has caused the deaths of at least 21 children in 2025, but stressed this figure is likely to be the tip of the iceberg. Centres for treating malnutrition are full of patients but do not have sufficient supplies for emergency feeding, it added. In July alone, 5,100 children have so far been admitted to malnutrition programmes, said Dr Rik Peeperkorn, the WHO's representative for the occupied Palestinian territories. Some 800 of those children were severely emaciated, he said. Mr Ghebreyesus said: \"I don't know what you would call it other than mass starvation, and it's man-made, and that's very clear.\" \"This is because of [the] blockade,\" he continued, adding that 95% of households in Gaza are also facing severe water shortages. He said the UN and its humanitarian partners were unable to deliver any food for nearly 80 days between March and May, while an aid blockade was in place, and that the resumption of deliveries has been insufficient. There is no famine in Gaza, says Israel An Israeli government spokesperson told Sky News the food shortages have \"been engineered by Hamas\", before stating: \"There is no famine in Gaza.\" Speaking on the News Hour with Mark Austin, David Mencer continued: \"There is a famine of the truth and Israel will not stop telling it.\" He said aid is \"flowing\" into the enclave but Hamas \"loots the trucks [and] deliberately endangers its own people\". The fighters deny stealing food. Mr Mencer said Israel has allowed more than 4,400 aid trucks to enter Gaza since it lifted the blockade in May, adding that more than 700 are waiting to be picked up and distributed by the United Nations. That is an average of around 70 trucks a day, which is the lowest rate of the war and far below the 500-600 trucks a day the UN says is needed. \"The problem is not Israel,\" he said. \"The problem is Hamas.\" Supplies in Gaza 'totally depleted'  The comments came after more than 100 aid and rights groups warned of mass starvation in Gaza on Wednesday morning - saying supplies have become \"totally depleted\". Large amounts of food, clean water and medical supplies are sitting untouched just outside Gaza, but the groups blamed Israel for its \"restrictions\", which they say is creating \"chaos, starvation, and death\". The situation has become so bad, aid agencies warned they were seeing even their own colleagues \"waste away before their eyes\". Israel, which controls all supplies entering Gaza, has denied it is responsible for shortages of food and other supplies. In a statement signed by 111 organisations, the groups said: \"As the Israeli government's siege starves the people of Gaza, aid workers are now joining the same food lines, risking being shot just to feed their families. \"With supplies now totally depleted, humanitarian organisations are witnessing their own colleagues and partners waste away before their eyes. \"The government of Israel's restrictions, delays, and fragmentation under its total siege have created chaos, starvation, and death.\" The groups called for governments to demand the lifting of all restrictions and for the restoration of a \"principled, UN-led humanitarian response\". The Norwegian Refugee Council, which backed the statement and is one of the largest independent aid organisations in Gaza, said it has no more supplies to distribute and some of its staff are starving - and accused Israel of paralysing its work. \"Our last tent, our last food parcel, our last relief items have been distributed. There is nothing left,\" Jan Egeland, the secretary general of the council, told the Reuters news agency.  United Nations secretary-general Antonio Guterres said \"starvation is knocking on every door\" in the Palestinian territory, describing the situation as a \"horror show\". Officials in the Hamas-run strip said at least 101 people are known to have died of malnutrition during the conflict in Gaza, including 80 children, most of them in recent weeks.  Some food stocks in Gaza have run out since Israel cut off all supplies in March and then lifted the blockade in May with new measures it said were needed to prevent aid from being diverted to militant groups. Israel's Foreign Ministry has accused the organisations of \"echoing Hamas propaganda\".

It feels like the situation is deteriorating by the day – the letter comes hours after the United Nations secretary-general described aid distribution and food shortages in Gaza as a \"horror show\". There is certainly momentum in the demands for a ceasefire and for aid supplies backed up in neighbouring countries to be allowed into Gaza. But will it have any impact? Israel acknowledges there has been a significant drop in the amount of aid reaching Gaza. But the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation – now in charge of almost all aid distribution in Gaza – has fiercely hit back about its handling of the situation. However, Israel has given no public sign that it plans to do anything to alleviate the plight of hungry Gazans any time soon – instead shifting blame to the door of the UN. The UN used to run most aid distribution, but Israel stopped that in May claiming aid was falling into the hands of the militant group Hamas. So if there's – as yet – no sign of the aid chain being unblocked, what of the calls in the letter for a ceasefire? People say watch for movement by Donald Trump's envoy Steve Witkoff. He is currently in Europe and if he goes on to Doha, where indirect talks are taking place between Hamas and Israel, that could signal some sort of progress towards a ceasefire. It has reportedly resulted in Israeli troops firing on Palestinian civilians in search of food on multiple occasions. More than 800 people have reportedly been killed in recent weeks trying to reach food, mostly in shootings by Israeli soldiers posted near distribution centres."

        "Headline": "The inquest into the teenager's death in Tenerife is resuming months after being adjourned. Here is all you need to know.",
        "Content": "An inquest into the death of teenager Jay Slater is due to resume today after being adjourned two months ago. The 19-year-old from Oswaldtwistle, Lancashire, disappeared on the Spanish island of Tenerife after attending the NRG music festival on 16 June 2024. He was reported missing and, after an extensive search and rescue mission and significant media attention, his body was found a month later on 15 July. An inquest into the teenager's death began in May at Preston Coroner's Court, but was adjourned the same day, to the disappointment of Mr Slater's mother Debbie Duncan. Dr James Adeley, a senior coroner for Lancashire and Blackburn with Darwen, made the decision after a number of witnesses who had been asked to give evidence could not be traced or were unable to attend. After making a final effort to trace key witnesses, the inquest will now resume on 23 and 24 July. Here is all you need to know. What happened to Jay Slater? On 17 June 2024, just days into his first holiday without his family, Mr Slater was reported missing. The night before, he is believed to have left his friends at the Papagayo nightclub in the resort of Playa de las Americas and made an hour-long drive to a modest Airbnb in the tiny village of Masca, with two people he had met on the holiday. Phone data reveals Mr Slater's last known location was the Rural de Teno park - a mountainous area popular with hikers. The 19-year-old's disappearance sparked a huge 29-day search effort - with emergency services, local volunteers and Mr Slater's family combing a large mountainous area of the island searching for any trace of the teenager. Within days, Facebook groups dedicated to the case had also been set up - with some quickly attracting hundreds of thousands of members.  The Spanish civil guard released a statement on 15 July to say they had \"located the lifeless body of a young man in the Masca area after 29 days of constant search\". What happened during the first inquest hearing? Mr Slater's mother Debbie Duncan, stepfather and other family members gathered at the inquest in Preston Coroner's Court on 21 May. Home Office pathologist Dr Richard Shepherd said Mr Slater's injuries were \"entirely consistent\" with a fall from a great height and gave an official cause of death as a head injury. \"The injuries were so severe I have no doubt he would have been instantly unconscious from the moment of that blow to the head. Death could well have been instant, the injury was so severe,\" Dr Shepherd said. He said there was no suggestion that the teenager had been assaulted or restrained. Toxicology expert Dr Stephanie Martin said traces of MDMA and MDA, commonly known as ecstasy, along with cocaine and alcohol, were also found in Mr Slater's body. Detective Chief Inspector Rachel Higson, from Lancashire Constabulary, told the court that messages from Mr Slater's friends advising him to go home were found on his phone DCI Higson said at 8.35am on 17 June, his friend Ms Law sent him a message saying: \"Before it gets boiling get back to wherever you have come from.\" At 8.50am there was the last known outgoing communication from Mr Slater's phone, a 22-second call from him to Ms Law in which he is believed to have said he had cut his leg on a cactus, he was lost in the mountains and his phone battery was on 1%. Who are the missing witnesses? The witnesses that the court tried to trace the first time included Bradley Geoghegan, Brandon Hodgson and Lucy Law, who were all with Mr Slater in Tenerife. At the time of the first inquest it is believed they were not in the UK and were unable to attend.

Mr Slater's mother Ms Duncan told the court in May that she wanted \"these people to be sat in front of us, because our son went on holiday and didn't come back, so there's questions we need to ask\". Coroner Dr Adeley said he would adjourn the inquest in an effort to find the witnesses and give Ms Duncan the \"answers you want\", but it remains unknown if the key witnesses will appear at the inquest on Thursday and Friday."

        "Content": "\n          Lead world news presenter\n              @SkyYaldaHakim\n  It is no secret that Donald Trump wants the Nobel Peace Prize. But the very man who could help him achieve this is also the man keeping the trophy at bay. The Israeli prime minister nominated Trump for the prize during a recent trip to Washington but Netanyahu's actions in Syria and Gaza over the past few weeks prompted yet another call from the president telling him to rein it in. But why this time? Firstly, because of Syria. Tribal fighting between the Druze minority community and Bedouins in the southern city of Sweida has seen over 1,000 dead and many more injured.  Netanyahu has declared himself protector of the Druze across the region, partly because a large portion of that community live in the occupied Golan Heights and are loyal to him. The Druze also serve in the IDF. So, when a Druze leader asked him to help, he did. In an extraordinary way. Not only did he bomb the city of Sweida, but he launched a strike on military headquarters in the capital Damascus, a stone's throw away from the Presidential Palace. Groups flocked to Sweida to help fight against the tribe who called on Israel's aid, further fanning the flames of violence. A shaky ceasefire is now in place - brokered by the US which, for now, is standing firm behind Syria's new President Ahmed al Sharaa. 👉Listen to The World with Richard Engel and Yalda Hakim on your podcast app👈 It is firmly in the US's interests for Sharaa's vision of Syria to work. A reformed jihadist who cut his teeth in ISIS and al Qaeda is now calling for an equal and open Syria. His chequered past makes him an unlikely ally of President Trump. A man who once was in a group that chanted \"death to America\" now shakes the hand of the leader of the same country. It is also no secret that Trump respects Sharaa, calling him an \"attractive, tough guy\". But Trump has plans for the region that require a lasting peace in Syria. And right now, Sharaa is the only person promising to deliver this. Hungry for an expansion of the Abraham Accords and normalisation between Syria and Israel, Trump lifted sanctions and welcomed Sharaa to the world stage. But Israel and the Emiratis remain suspicious of the new president and are deeply sceptical of his promise of reformed jihadism. Read more: Who are the Druze and who are they fighting in Syria?  Netanyahu's strikes were a warning as much as anything. Arab officials tell me that Sharaa can't even use the toilet without telling the Turks, but the Israelis have made it clear he will also have to watch his back. Trump was reportedly deeply angry at Israel's strike on the only Catholic Church in Gaza. The IDF said it was \"unintentional\" but the incident warranted a call from the president which led to a rare public statement from Netanyahu on the \"tragic incident\". Add to this the brutal murder of the Palestinian-American Saifullah Kamel Musallet in the West Bank by Israeli settlers, and an increase in violence against the Christian community in general, and you have all the elements in place to warrant criticism from a usually staunch ally: the evangelical MAGA base. US ambassador to Israel Mike Huckabee called an arson attack on a Christian church in the West Bank \"terrorism\" in a recent trip to the village where the settler attack happened. This is a man who once said there is \"no such thing\" as the West Bank, calling it Judea and Samaria - a biblical term used by the right in Israel and America. \"There's no such thing as a settlement,\" he continued. \"They're communities, they're neighbourhoods, they're cities. There's no such thing as an occupation.\" Read more:Homes burning after mass pillaging in SweidaGaza faces 'man-made' starvation Add to that Trump's original pick for attorney general, Matt Gaetz, who called into question Israel's investigation into what he called the \"pattern of Israeli settler attacks\", and MAGA diehard Marjorie Taylor Greene who proposed a slashing of America's funding to Israel by $500m. These are some of Trump's most loyal of followers now voicing a once rare criticism of Israel. Again, this will be frustrating to Trump - who as quickly as he tapes up one fissure within his base, sees another starting to tear."

        "Content": "Donald Trump has declared the United States is going to \"win\" the artificial intelligence race, as his administration unveiled its AI Action Plan. The new blueprint is designed to speed up the building of energy-intensive data centres - which run AI products - by loosening environmental rules, while also vastly expanding the sale of AI technologies overseas. The plan, which includes 90 recommendations, comes as America attempts to maintain its edge over China, with both superpowers investing heavily in the industry to secure economic and military superiority. It calls for the export of US AI software and hardware abroad, as well as urging the removal of \"red tape\" that could be seen as stopping the industry from flourishing. In a speech in Washington DC, Mr Trump said: \"America is the country that started the AI race. And as president of the United States, I'm here today to declare that America is going to win it.\" He said the technological arms race with China was a fight that will define the 21st century.

Mr Trump rescinded Mr Biden's executive order aimed at promoting competition, protecting consumers and ensuring AI was not used for misinformation. He also rescinded Mr Biden's so-called AI diffusion rule, which capped the amount of American AI computing capacity some countries were allowed to obtain via US AI chip imports. The Trump plan also aims to block the government from doing business with tech companies unless they \"ensure that their systems are objective and free from top-down ideological bias\". Mr Trump's AI czar, David Sacks, has been criticising \"woke AI\" for more than a year. Demand for power in the US is hitting record highs this year after nearly two decades of stagnation as the number of AI and cloud computing data centres expands across the country. The tech industry has been pushing to loosen rules to get its computing facilities connected to power sources. But the AI building boom has also led to more demand for fossil fuel production, which contributes to global warming."

        "Content": "\n          Wales reporter\n              @TomosGruffydd\n The demand on mountain rescue teams in North Wales is \"unsustainable\" ahead of what promises to be a busy summer season, according to emergency services. Thousands of visitors are expected to flock to the area to experience the scenic views of Eryri National Park, also known as Snowdonia, over the coming weeks. But mountain rescue teams and police on the ground are urging people to be prepared before scaling the heights of Wales's largest national park. It comes after officers recently shared the tragic story of how volunteers discovered the remains of missing walkers David Brookfield and Shayne Colaco, the latter of whom had been missing for 12 years, on the same day last year. Owain Llewelyn, Chief Superintendent at North Wales Police, told Sky News there had been a \"significant increase\" in the number of visitors to the area since the lifting of COVID restrictions in 2021. \"With that increase in numbers, we've seen a significant increase in demand as well,\" he said. \"I think it's fair to say that this time of year, people who come to visit North Wales are really excited about their trip. \n                  Conservative Senedd member Laura Anne Jones announces defection to Reform UK\n                 \n                  Former Conservative MP Katie Wallis appears in court accused of having false passport\n                 \n                  Hit-and-run victim who lost leg criticises 'appalling' sentence given to uninsured driver\n                 \"For the people who are part of mountain rescue teams and the blue light responders, it's actually the time of year in many ways we dread, because we know that that significant increase in demand is going to come.\" Chief Superintendent Llewellyn said it was important for people to understand their limits. \"It's about understanding that the weather conditions on the summit can be dramatically different and it's about understanding that getting to the top is not the be all and end all of the day,\" he added. \"So actually, if people are starting to get tired, it's about stopping, being realistic and turning round and just coming back down.\" He said the force was \"amazingly lucky\" to work alongside teams of mountain rescue volunteers, describing them as \"an amazing bunch of people\" who \"put their lives at risk at times to help people who have got into difficulties in the mountains\". One such volunteer is Chris Lloyd from Ogwen Valley Mountain Rescue Organisation, who has given his time as part of the team since 1977. While a lot has changed in the last five decades, Mr Lloyd told Sky News there was \"an increasing number of calls which are really unnecessary\". So far this year, the team has responded to 103 callouts, while they received 121 in the whole of 2019.

The electric carmaker, effectively run part-time by founder and CEO Elon Musk for much of this year after his now-defunct spell at the heart of Donald Trump's government, reported a 12% drop in revenues over the second quarter of the year. Its update showed a total of $22.5bn sales, despite aggressive discounting and low-cost financing put in place to help shield Tesla from many headwinds. They include strong competition from cheaper electric vehicles and a backlash against Musk's former political alignment with the president. Sales and profits came in lower than analysts had predicted. Tesla said it was looking to ramp up production of the more affordable model during the second half of this year. It gave no further details but it is a nod to investor concerns that the appeal of Tesla's range is restricted when compared to that of competitors. \n                  Can Tesla survive without Trump?\n                 \n                  Revealed: The huge financial impact of Elon Musk's row with Donald Trump\n                 \n                  Musk's AI chatbot updated after posting antisemitic messages online\n                 The results were the first for shareholders to digest since the so-called bromance between Mr Musk and Donald Trump ended acrimoniously in June.  Tesla's shares remain almost 18% down over the year to date - lagging a recovery among rivals - and were flat in extended trading. The drag can mainly be explained by the 2025 sales slowdown, Tesla's particular exposure to the president's trade war and the often violent backlash against Musk's former role in the Trump administration which enacted big cuts to federal government spending. Globally, customers have been put off by interference by Musk in national elections, particularly in Germany, and stiff competition from cheaper alternatives to Tesla's electric car ranges.  While his departure from Washington allowed the tech tycoon to focus more on his vast business ventures, his beef with the president over the cost of the Big Beautiful tax and spending Bill has left Tesla exposed to retaliation from the White House. Recent analysis by Sky News showed the extent to which the company's profitability is threatened through the potential loss of billions of dollars in government subsidies - a sanction threatened by the president. The latest set of results showed a steady income from these so-called regulatory credits, amounting to $435m between April and June. That was down from the $458m reported for the same period last year.  Tesla had revealed earlier this month that production and deliveries covering the quarter were below expectations. A total of 384,122 Teslas were delivered in the period, a 13.5% fall on the same period last year. It marked the second consecutive quarterly sales decline and was not helped by the changeover to the refreshed Model Y.

Bloomberg News reported earlier on Wednesday that the company was in talks about operating a Robotaxi service in Nevada."

        "Content": "An inquest into the death of teenager Jay Slater is due to resume today after being adjourned two months ago. The 19-year-old from Oswaldtwistle, Lancashire, disappeared on the Spanish island of Tenerife after attending the NRG music festival on 16 June 2024. He was reported missing and, after an extensive search and rescue mission and significant media attention, his body was found a month later on 15 July. An inquest into the teenager's death began in May at Preston Coroner's Court, but was adjourned the same day, to the disappointment of Mr Slater's mother Debbie Duncan. Dr James Adeley, a senior coroner for Lancashire and Blackburn with Darwen, made the decision after a number of witnesses who had been asked to give evidence could not be traced or were unable to attend. After making a final effort to trace key witnesses, the inquest will now resume on 23 and 24 July. Here is all you need to know. What happened to Jay Slater? On 17 June 2024, just days into his first holiday without his family, Mr Slater was reported missing. The night before, he is believed to have left his friends at the Papagayo nightclub in the resort of Playa de las Americas and made an hour-long drive to a modest Airbnb in the tiny village of Masca, with two people he had met on the holiday. Phone data reveals Mr Slater's last known location was the Rural de Teno park - a mountainous area popular with hikers. The 19-year-old's disappearance sparked a huge 29-day search effort - with emergency services, local volunteers and Mr Slater's family combing a large mountainous area of the island searching for any trace of the teenager. Within days, Facebook groups dedicated to the case had also been set up - with some quickly attracting hundreds of thousands of members.  The Spanish civil guard released a statement on 15 July to say they had \"located the lifeless body of a young man in the Masca area after 29 days of constant search\". What happened during the first inquest hearing? Mr Slater's mother Debbie Duncan, stepfather and other family members gathered at the inquest in Preston Coroner's Court on 21 May. Home Office pathologist Dr Richard Shepherd said Mr Slater's injuries were \"entirely consistent\" with a fall from a great height and gave an official cause of death as a head injury. \"The injuries were so severe I have no doubt he would have been instantly unconscious from the moment of that blow to the head. Death could well have been instant, the injury was so severe,\" Dr Shepherd said. He said there was no suggestion that the teenager had been assaulted or restrained. Toxicology expert Dr Stephanie Martin said traces of MDMA and MDA, commonly known as ecstasy, along with cocaine and alcohol, were also found in Mr Slater's body. Detective Chief Inspector Rachel Higson, from Lancashire Constabulary, told the court that messages from Mr Slater's friends advising him to go home were found on his phone DCI Higson said at 8.35am on 17 June, his friend Ms Law sent him a message saying: \"Before it gets boiling get back to wherever you have come from.\" At 8.50am there was the last known outgoing communication from Mr Slater's phone, a 22-second call from him to Ms Law in which he is believed to have said he had cut his leg on a cactus, he was lost in the mountains and his phone battery was on 1%. Who are the missing witnesses? The witnesses that the court tried to trace the first time included Bradley Geoghegan, Brandon Hodgson and Lucy Law, who were all with Mr Slater in Tenerife. At the time of the first inquest it is believed they were not in the UK and were unable to attend.

Mr Slater's mother Ms Duncan told the court in May that she wanted \"these people to be sat in front of us, because our son went on holiday and didn't come back, so there's questions we need to ask\". Coroner Dr Adeley said he would adjourn the inquest in an effort to find the witnesses and give Ms Duncan the \"answers you want\", but it remains unknown if the key witnesses will appear at the inquest on Thursday and Friday."

        "Content": "\n          Wales reporter\n              @TomosGruffydd\n The demand on mountain rescue teams in North Wales is \"unsustainable\" ahead of what promises to be a busy summer season, according to emergency services. Thousands of visitors are expected to flock to the area to experience the scenic views of Eryri National Park, also known as Snowdonia, over the coming weeks. But mountain rescue teams and police on the ground are urging people to be prepared before scaling the heights of Wales's largest national park. It comes after officers recently shared the tragic story of how volunteers discovered the remains of missing walkers David Brookfield and Shayne Colaco, the latter of whom had been missing for 12 years, on the same day last year. Owain Llewelyn, Chief Superintendent at North Wales Police, told Sky News there had been a \"significant increase\" in the number of visitors to the area since the lifting of COVID restrictions in 2021. \"With that increase in numbers, we've seen a significant increase in demand as well,\" he said. \"I think it's fair to say that this time of year, people who come to visit North Wales are really excited about their trip. \n                  Conservative Senedd member Laura Anne Jones announces defection to Reform UK\n                 \n                  Former Conservative MP Katie Wallis appears in court accused of having false passport\n                 \n                  Hit-and-run victim who lost leg criticises 'appalling' sentence given to uninsured driver\n                 \"For the people who are part of mountain rescue teams and the blue light responders, it's actually the time of year in many ways we dread, because we know that that significant increase in demand is going to come.\" Chief Superintendent Llewellyn said it was important for people to understand their limits. \"It's about understanding that the weather conditions on the summit can be dramatically different and it's about understanding that getting to the top is not the be all and end all of the day,\" he added. \"So actually, if people are starting to get tired, it's about stopping, being realistic and turning round and just coming back down.\" He said the force was \"amazingly lucky\" to work alongside teams of mountain rescue volunteers, describing them as \"an amazing bunch of people\" who \"put their lives at risk at times to help people who have got into difficulties in the mountains\". One such volunteer is Chris Lloyd from Ogwen Valley Mountain Rescue Organisation, who has given his time as part of the team since 1977. While a lot has changed in the last five decades, Mr Lloyd told Sky News there was \"an increasing number of calls which are really unnecessary\". So far this year, the team has responded to 103 callouts, while they received 121 in the whole of 2019.

They had worn masks and were armed as they went to the Elthorne Estate where they met Lupqi, the court was told. By the time they arrived, the filming had ended, and most people had left, but some local children and teenagers remained in the area. The group then carried out their deadly attack. The alarm was raised as a black-clad figure wearing a balaclava was spotted crouching down and moving towards Leonardo, his brother and others, with a large knife. Three more males in black stood up from where they had been hiding behind cars as they edged towards the group, the court was told. Leonardo was stabbed in the chest, with the wound cutting through his left lung and one of the major blood vessels in his body, causing fatal blood loss. Leonardo's brother had run away from the scene but later looped back and saw his sibling lying motionless on the ground, the court heard. Mr Shekaj was stabbed in the back, with the wound cutting through his left lung and deep into his body. He was driven to Whittington Hospital by members of the public but he died on arrival.

Tom Hayes was the first of nine traders to prosecuted by the Serious Fraud Office. In 2012, he was accused of rigging Libor - an interest rate on loans and financial contracts that was used throughout the financial system. The rate was determined daily, based on submissions from several large banks. Money latest: One million owed refunds from HMRC  Mr Hayes was originally sentenced to 14 years in jail, one of the toughest sentences ever handed out for white collar crime. He served more than five years in prison, including at the high security prison Belmarsh. Speaking to Sky News after the Supreme Court overturned the conviction, Mr Hayes said: \"I came out [of prison] to a son who was nine years old who I left when he was three. My marriage broke down whilst I was in prison. My mental health broke down while I was in prison.\" \n                  Lord Myners dies: Tributes paid to former Labour minister who was brought in to tackle 2008 financial crash\n                 \n                  BoE deputy governor: Banks could still fail - but safely\n                 \n                  Northern Rock shareholders 'must be compensated'\n                 Mr Hayes said he was made responsible for damage caused by the financial crisis. \"There was this zeitgeist that existed where they wanted to send bankers to prison... we were unlucky,\" he said. He was joined by Carlo Palombo, who was convicted in 2019 for rigging Euribor, the Euro Libor rate. Mr Palombo said he spent most of his days in a small cell that he shared with another inmate at Wandsworth Prison. He said he was the victim of a \"purge\" by banks and regulators as they sought to absolve themselves of the consequences of the crash. \"The stuff of which I was accused and convicted was something that was done completely openly by absolutely every single person… it was just a normal business practice of the bank,\" he said. Supreme Court judges said the two men did not receive fair trials because the juries were misdirected in the original cases. Essentially, they had been told their behaviour was dishonest without reaching that conclusion themselves. Both men are now trying to move on with their lives. Mr Hayes said he wanted to move to the sea and rebuild his family."

Tom Hayes, 45, was handed a 14-year jail sentence - cut to 11 years on appeal - in 2015, which was one of the toughest ever to be imposed for white-collar crime in UK history. The former Citigroup and UBS trader, along with Carlo Palombo, 46, who was jailed for four years in 2019 over rigging the Euribor interest rates, took their cases to the country's highest court after the Court of Appeal dismissed their appeals last year. The Supreme Court unanimously allowed Mr Hayes' appeal, overturning his 2015 conviction of eight counts of conspiracy to defraud by manipulating Libor, a now-defunct benchmark interest rate. Ex-vice president of euro rates at Barclays bank Mr Palombo's conviction for conspiring with others to submit false or misleading Euribor submissions between 2005 and 2009 was also quashed. Mr Hayes, who served five and a half years in prison before being released on licence in 2021, described the \"incredible feeling\" after the ruling. \"My faith in the criminal justice system at times was likely destroyed and it has been restored by the justices from the Supreme Court today and I think it's only right that more criminal appeals should be heard at this level,\" he said. \n                  'Everyone's on edge': Epping braces for another hotel protest\n                 \n                  Jay Slater inquest resumes after final effort to trace witnesses - all you need to know\n                 \n                  Off-the-shelf medical tests are failing to back up accuracy promises with evidence, study finds\n                 Both he and Mr Palombo have been described as \"scapegoats\" for the 2008 financial crisis, but Mr Hayes said: \"We literally had nothing to do with it.\" A spokesperson for the Serious Fraud Office (SFO), which opposed the appeals, said it would not be seeking a retrial. In 2012, the SFO began criminal investigations into traders it suspected of manipulating the Libor and Euribor benchmark interest rates. Mr Hayes was the first person to be prosecuted by the SFO, which brought prosecutions against 20 people between 2013 and 2019, seven of whom were convicted at trial, two pleaded guilty and 11 were acquitted. He had also been facing criminal charges in the US but these were dismissed after two other men involved in a similar case had their convictions reversed in 2022. Mr Hayes, a gifted mathematician who is autistic, was described at his Southwark Crown Court trial as the \"ringmaster\" at the centre of an enormous fraud to manipulate benchmark interest rates and boost his own six-figure earnings. He has always maintained that the Libor rates he requested fell within a permissible range and that his conduct was common at the time and condoned by bosses. Mr Hayes and Mr Palombo argued their convictions depended on a definition of Libor and Euribor which assumes there is an absolute legal bar on a bank's commercial interests being taken into account when setting rates. The panel of five Supreme Court justices found there was \"ample evidence\" for a jury to convict the two men if it had been properly directed. But in an 82-page judgment, Lord Leggatt said jury direction errors made both convictions unsafe, adding: \"That misdirection undermined the fairness of the trial.\" Lawyers representing Mr Hayes and Mr Palombo said the ruling could open the door for the seven others found guilty to have their convictions overturned and that there were grounds for a public inquiry."

        "Headline": "Israel denies it is responsible for shortages of food - but aid groups have accused its government of creating \"chaos, starvation, and death\".",
        "Content": " The chief of the World Health Organization (WHO) has said Gaza is suffering \"man-made mass starvation\" because of an Israeli blockade on aid to the enclave. Director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said at a news conference that the population of Gaza is \"facing yet another killer on top of bombs and bullets - starvation\". The WHO said a \"deadly surge\" in malnutrition has caused the deaths of at least 21 children in 2025, but stressed this figure is likely to be the tip of the iceberg. Centres for treating malnutrition are full of patients but do not have sufficient supplies for emergency feeding, it added. In July alone, 5,100 children have so far been admitted to malnutrition programmes, said Dr Rik Peeperkorn, the WHO's representative for the occupied Palestinian territories. Some 800 of those children were severely emaciated, he said. Mr Ghebreyesus said: \"I don't know what you would call it other than mass starvation, and it's man-made, and that's very clear.\" \"This is because of [the] blockade,\" he continued, adding that 95% of households in Gaza are also facing severe water shortages. He said the UN and its humanitarian partners were unable to deliver any food for nearly 80 days between March and May, while an aid blockade was in place, and that the resumption of deliveries has been insufficient. There is no famine in Gaza, says Israel An Israeli government spokesperson told Sky News the food shortages have \"been engineered by Hamas\", before stating: \"There is no famine in Gaza.\" Speaking on the News Hour with Mark Austin, David Mencer continued: \"There is a famine of the truth and Israel will not stop telling it.\" He said aid is \"flowing\" into the enclave but Hamas \"loots the trucks [and] deliberately endangers its own people\". The fighters deny stealing food. Mr Mencer said Israel has allowed more than 4,400 aid trucks to enter Gaza since it lifted the blockade in May, adding that more than 700 are waiting to be picked up and distributed by the United Nations. That is an average of around 70 trucks a day, which is the lowest rate of the war and far below the 500-600 trucks a day the UN says is needed. \"The problem is not Israel,\" he said. \"The problem is Hamas.\" Supplies in Gaza 'totally depleted'  The comments came after more than 100 aid and rights groups warned of mass starvation in Gaza on Wednesday morning - saying supplies have become \"totally depleted\". Large amounts of food, clean water and medical supplies are sitting untouched just outside Gaza, but the groups blamed Israel for its \"restrictions\", which they say is creating \"chaos, starvation, and death\". The situation has become so bad, aid agencies warned they were seeing even their own colleagues \"waste away before their eyes\". Israel, which controls all supplies entering Gaza, has denied it is responsible for shortages of food and other supplies. In a statement signed by 111 organisations, the groups said: \"As the Israeli government's siege starves the people of Gaza, aid workers are now joining the same food lines, risking being shot just to feed their families. \"With supplies now totally depleted, humanitarian organisations are witnessing their own colleagues and partners waste away before their eyes. \"The government of Israel's restrictions, delays, and fragmentation under its total siege have created chaos, starvation, and death.\" The groups called for governments to demand the lifting of all restrictions and for the restoration of a \"principled, UN-led humanitarian response\". The Norwegian Refugee Council, which backed the statement and is one of the largest independent aid organisations in Gaza, said it has no more supplies to distribute and some of its staff are starving - and accused Israel of paralysing its work. \"Our last tent, our last food parcel, our last relief items have been distributed. There is nothing left,\" Jan Egeland, the secretary general of the council, told the Reuters news agency.  United Nations secretary-general Antonio Guterres said \"starvation is knocking on every door\" in the Palestinian territory, describing the situation as a \"horror show\". Officials in the Hamas-run strip said at least 101 people are known to have died of malnutrition during the conflict in Gaza, including 80 children, most of them in recent weeks.  Some food stocks in Gaza have run out since Israel cut off all supplies in March and then lifted the blockade in May with new measures it said were needed to prevent aid from being diverted to militant groups. Israel's Foreign Ministry has accused the organisations of \"echoing Hamas propaganda\".

It feels like the situation is deteriorating by the day – the letter comes hours after the United Nations secretary-general described aid distribution and food shortages in Gaza as a \"horror show\". There is certainly momentum in the demands for a ceasefire and for aid supplies backed up in neighbouring countries to be allowed into Gaza. But will it have any impact? Israel acknowledges there has been a significant drop in the amount of aid reaching Gaza. But the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation – now in charge of almost all aid distribution in Gaza – has fiercely hit back about its handling of the situation. However, Israel has given no public sign that it plans to do anything to alleviate the plight of hungry Gazans any time soon – instead shifting blame to the door of the UN. The UN used to run most aid distribution, but Israel stopped that in May claiming aid was falling into the hands of the militant group Hamas. So if there's – as yet – no sign of the aid chain being unblocked, what of the calls in the letter for a ceasefire? People say watch for movement by Donald Trump's envoy Steve Witkoff. He is currently in Europe and if he goes on to Doha, where indirect talks are taking place between Hamas and Israel, that could signal some sort of progress towards a ceasefire. It has reportedly resulted in Israeli troops firing on Palestinian civilians in search of food on multiple occasions. More than 800 people have reportedly been killed in recent weeks trying to reach food, mostly in shootings by Israeli soldiers posted near distribution centres."

        "Content": "\n          Lead world news presenter\n              @SkyYaldaHakim\n  It is no secret that Donald Trump wants the Nobel Peace Prize. But the very man who could help him achieve this is also the man keeping the trophy at bay. The Israeli prime minister nominated Trump for the prize during a recent trip to Washington but Netanyahu's actions in Syria and Gaza over the past few weeks prompted yet another call from the president telling him to rein it in. But why this time? Firstly, because of Syria. Tribal fighting between the Druze minority community and Bedouins in the southern city of Sweida has seen over 1,000 dead and many more injured.  Netanyahu has declared himself protector of the Druze across the region, partly because a large portion of that community live in the occupied Golan Heights and are loyal to him. The Druze also serve in the IDF. So, when a Druze leader asked him to help, he did. In an extraordinary way. Not only did he bomb the city of Sweida, but he launched a strike on military headquarters in the capital Damascus, a stone's throw away from the Presidential Palace. Groups flocked to Sweida to help fight against the tribe who called on Israel's aid, further fanning the flames of violence. A shaky ceasefire is now in place - brokered by the US which, for now, is standing firm behind Syria's new President Ahmed al Sharaa. 👉Listen to The World with Richard Engel and Yalda Hakim on your podcast app👈 It is firmly in the US's interests for Sharaa's vision of Syria to work. A reformed jihadist who cut his teeth in ISIS and al Qaeda is now calling for an equal and open Syria. His chequered past makes him an unlikely ally of President Trump. A man who once was in a group that chanted \"death to America\" now shakes the hand of the leader of the same country. It is also no secret that Trump respects Sharaa, calling him an \"attractive, tough guy\". But Trump has plans for the region that require a lasting peace in Syria. And right now, Sharaa is the only person promising to deliver this. Hungry for an expansion of the Abraham Accords and normalisation between Syria and Israel, Trump lifted sanctions and welcomed Sharaa to the world stage. But Israel and the Emiratis remain suspicious of the new president and are deeply sceptical of his promise of reformed jihadism. Read more: Who are the Druze and who are they fighting in Syria?  Netanyahu's strikes were a warning as much as anything. Arab officials tell me that Sharaa can't even use the toilet without telling the Turks, but the Israelis have made it clear he will also have to watch his back. Trump was reportedly deeply angry at Israel's strike on the only Catholic Church in Gaza. The IDF said it was \"unintentional\" but the incident warranted a call from the president which led to a rare public statement from Netanyahu on the \"tragic incident\". Add to this the brutal murder of the Palestinian-American Saifullah Kamel Musallet in the West Bank by Israeli settlers, and an increase in violence against the Christian community in general, and you have all the elements in place to warrant criticism from a usually staunch ally: the evangelical MAGA base. US ambassador to Israel Mike Huckabee called an arson attack on a Christian church in the West Bank \"terrorism\" in a recent trip to the village where the settler attack happened. This is a man who once said there is \"no such thing\" as the West Bank, calling it Judea and Samaria - a biblical term used by the right in Israel and America. \"There's no such thing as a settlement,\" he continued. \"They're communities, they're neighbourhoods, they're cities. There's no such thing as an occupation.\" Read more:Homes burning after mass pillaging in SweidaGaza faces 'man-made' starvation Add to that Trump's original pick for attorney general, Matt Gaetz, who called into question Israel's investigation into what he called the \"pattern of Israeli settler attacks\", and MAGA diehard Marjorie Taylor Greene who proposed a slashing of America's funding to Israel by $500m. These are some of Trump's most loyal of followers now voicing a once rare criticism of Israel. Again, this will be frustrating to Trump - who as quickly as he tapes up one fissure within his base, sees another starting to tear."

        "Content": " A former US soldier who was employed to work within the Gaza aid system approved by Israel has claimed he saw security personnel shoot at Palestinians at a distribution centre. The unnamed American man, who served for 25 years in the US army, has alleged he witnessed force being used against unarmed innocent civilians in the Gaza Strip. \"There is no fixing this, this needs to be put an end to,\" he said in a video aired by Israeli free-to-air TV station Channel 12. It comes as the United Nations criticised an aid distribution scheme run by the US-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF) that has been supplying aid in the Strip since late May, claiming it is a \"sadistic death trap\" where \"snipers open fire randomly on crowds\". More than 1,000 people have been reported killed while trying to receive food aid since the end of May, according to the UN, with the territory facing a starvation crisis. The unnamed American claimed that as Palestinians were finishing getting their aid, security personnel \"began shooting in their direction, shooting at them, shooting at their feet… to get them to leave\". In another incident, he said a man was on his hands and knees picking up individual needles when security personnel wanted Palestinians to leave the site. \n                  Gaza faces 'man-made' mass starvation due to Israeli aid blockade, World Health Organization says\n                 \n                  More than 100 people die of hunger in Gaza, including 80 children, say Palestinian officials\n                 \n                  Gaza food situation 'worst it's ever been', charity says - as tank attack reportedly kills 12 at camp\n                 He alleged a contractor \"sprayed an entire can of pepper spray into his face - that's lethal\". He also recounted a third incident, describing how he was standing next to two women when a contractor threw a stun grenade and it landed between him and the women. \"This thing hit her and she just drops, just lifeless, collapsed to the ground. It looked like she had been killed\".  He said it was at that point that he decided he could no longer be part of the distribution system. Earlier this month, the Associated Press (AP) reported that it spoke anonymously to two US contractors guarding aid distribution sites who said their colleagues regularly threw stun grenades and pepper spray in the direction of the Palestinians. They said the security staff hired were often unqualified, unvetted, heavily armed and seemed to have an open licence to do whatever they wished, the AP reported. Videos provided by one of the contractors and taken at the sites showed hundreds of Palestinians crowded between metal gates, jostling for aid amid the sound of bullets and stun grenades and the sting of pepper spray, the agency added. The unnamed American man speaking to Channel 12 said the centres are in remote areas. \"The sites were not set up in locations, nor were they set up in a way that was conducive to distributing or delivering humanitarian aid to a needy population,\" he said. Residents are not allowed there by car and so people are on foot, he added. \"Most of them don't have shoes, no water, going through active warzone areas.\" Read more:Gaza faces 'man-made' mass starvation due to blockade - WHO'More than 100 people die of hunger in Gaza'Israeli soldier describes arbitrary killing of civilians in Gaza  He also said that if the United Nations method of aid distribution had the support, security and coordination that the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF) is getting, then the UN process would be very successful. UNRWA, the UN relief agency for Gaza, has criticised the US-backed aid distribution scheme run by GHF that has been supplying aid since late May, when Israel, which controls supplies into the territory, lifted an 11-week blockade. UNRWA Commissioner General Philippe Lazzarini said: \"The so-called 'GHF' distribution scheme is a sadistic death trap. Snipers open fire randomly on crowds as if they are given a licence to kill.\"  The GHF uses private US security and logistics companies and largely bypasses a UN-led system that Israel alleges has let Hamas-led militants loot aid shipments intended for civilians. Hamas denies the allegation. Journalists are not able to access GHF sites, which are located in Israeli military-controlled zones. When the AP ran its allegations earlier this month, it said it could not independently verify the contractors' stories. Sky News has not been able to independently verify the latest allegations. The GHF said in a statement: \"This is a disgruntled former contractor who was terminated for misconduct a month ago. GHF launched an immediate investigation as soon as these allegations were brought to our attention. Based on time-stamped video footage and witness statements, we have concluded that the claims made are categorically false. \"At no point were civilians under fire at a GHF distribution site. The gunfire heard in the video was confirmed to have originated from the IDF, which was outside the immediate vicinity of the GHF site. \"The gunfire was not directed at individuals, and no one was shot or injured. We take the safety and security of our operational sites extremely seriously. When behaviour falls short of our standards, we take action. The contractor seen shouting in the video is no longer part of our operations. \"We remain focused on our core mission - delivering food to the people of Gaza in a safe, direct, and uninterrupted manner, as we have done since launching operations on 27 May. Since then, we have distributed nearly 85 million meals to residents of the Gaza Strip.\""

        "Content": "\n          Climate reporter\n              @SeabrookClimate\n  The failure of countries to protect the planet from climate change may be a violation of international law, the UN's top court has said in a landmark ruling likely to shape climate litigation for years to come. In the world's biggest ever climate court case, the International Court of Justice (ICJ) on Wednesday also said countries damaged by climate change-fuelled extreme weather could be entitled to reparations in some cases. \"Failure of a state to take appropriate action to protect the climate system... may constitute an internationally wrongful act,\" Judge Yuji Iwasawa, the court president, said during the hearing. It wraps up the largest ever case heard by the ICJ in the Hague, which involved 96 countries, 10,000 pages of documents, 15 judges and two weeks of hearings in December.  Mr Iwasawa added a \"clean, healthy and sustainable environment\" is a human right - a verdict that may pave the way for countries to take each other to court for breaching that duty. Wednesday's findings have been claimed as a \"tremendous victory\" by campaigners and vulnerable nations like the Pacific islands of Vanuatu and Tuvalu, which are rapidly disappearing underwater, while footing the bill for climate damages caused by bigger, richer, more polluting countries. \n                  UK weather: Country set to have new heatwave - with temperatures over 30C in some areas, Met Office forecasts\n                 \n                  Prince William warns world's oceans are 'diminishing before our eyes' in call for urgent action\n                 \n                  More than 40% of Europe slides into drought, including pockets of Greece, southern Italy and Spain\n                 It will likely disappoint Global North countries - like the UK, Australia and Canada - who had told the judges in December that their climate responsibilities are limited to those set out in the Paris climate agreement. The 140-page long advisory opinion is non-binding, and it will take time to assess its true impact on climate action around the world. But observers say it sets a precedent for future court cases and opens the door for new types of lawsuits. Joana Setzer, climate litigation expert at the London School of Economics, said: \"For the first time, the world's highest court has made clear that states have a legal duty not only to prevent climate harm - but to fully repair it.\" She added: \"It adds decisive weight to calls for fair and effective climate reparations.\" Existing treaties like the Paris Agreement are widely perceived to not go far enough to tackle climate change, and progress on tackling emissions has gone at a snail's pace in comparison with the pace that scientists say is needed. Island nations, not content to \"go silently to our watery graves\", took the matter to the world's top court, asking for an advisory opinion on two things. Firstly, what countries are legally bound to do under international law to protect people and the planet from climate change, and secondly, what the penalties might be if they fail. The case started out as a campaign by 27 students studying law in Vanuatu in 2019. Eventually, the government there agreed to lobby the United Nations for the case, and in 2023 the UN General Assembly formally requested the ICJ to hear the case, backed by 132 countries. One of the students who initiated the campaign, Cynthia Houniuhi from the Solomon Islands, called it the \"start of a new chapter\". \"In five years or 10 years time, small islands like ours will cease to exist,\" she told Sky News. \"Imagine that for a young person, with hopes for the future, with hopes to have children... Will they get to see the islands that I lived on... or will I have to show pictures and say: 'This is where we used to be?' - I do not accept that.\" Danilo Garrido, legal counsel at Greenpeace International, said: \"This is the start of a new era of climate accountability at a global level.\" He said it will \"open the door for new cases, and hopefully bring justice to those, who despite having contributed the least to climate change, are already suffering its most severe consequences\"."

        "Content": " Thousands of Ukrainians demonstrated against the passing of a controversial bill threatening anti-corruption infrastructure in their country. Ukraine's parliament passed the legislation that will roll back the autonomy of two key anti-corruption agencies, and Volodymyr Zelenskyy signed it into law, according to the parliament's website late Tuesday. Ukrainians took to the streets in cities like Kyiv and Lviv to protest against the bill earlier that day, marking the first major demonstration against the government in more than three years of war. Follow the latest: Kremlin not expecting 'miracles' in new peace talks Many carried banners reading \"Protect the anti-corruption system, protect Ukraine's future\" or \"We are against it\". \"Corruption is a problem in any country, and it must always be fought,\" said Ihor Lachenkov, a blogger and activist who asked his more than 1.5million social media followers to join the protest. \"Ukraine has far fewer resources than Russia in this war,\" he said. \"If we misuse them, or worse, allow them to end up in the pockets of thieves, our chances of victory diminish.

Some protesters said that the bill's passage appeared to be a greater moral blow than the regular Russian drone and missile attacks, while others accused Ukraine's leadership of prioritising loyalty and personal connections over the fight against corruption. Under the amendments, the prosecutor general - who has been appointed by Mr Zelenskyy - will gain strict control over investigations and cases handled by the National Anti-Corruption Bureau of Ukraine (NABU) and the Specialised Anti-Corruption Prosecutor's Office (SAPO). The changes would also allow the prosecutor general to transfer cases from the agencies and reassign prosecutors. The agencies said this will cause the head of SAPO to \"become a nominal figure, while NABU will lose its independence and turn into a subdivision of the prosecutor general's office\". The passing of the bill could also impact Ukraine's bid to join the European Union, as fighting entrenched corruption is crucial both for EU ambitions and maintaining the war-torn country's access to billions of pounds in Western aid. The EU's Enlargement Commissioner Marta Kos expressed concern over the vote in parliament, labelling it \"a serious step back\". She added: \"Independent bodies like NABU & SAPO are essential for Ukraine's EU path.\" Mr Zelenskyy, whose party holds a majority in parliament, said in his nightly address on Tuesday that anti-corruption bodies would continue to function \"but without any Russian influence\". \"It all must be cleansed. There must be more justice. Of course, NABU and SAPO will continue their work,\" he said. \"It's also important that the prosecutor general be committed to ensuring real accountability for those who break the law. This is what Ukraine truly needs.\" The Ukrainian president said on Wednesday that he had gathered all heads of Ukraine's law enforcement and anti-corruption agencies, along with the prosecutor general, for a \"frank and constructive conversation that truly helps\". \"We all hear what society is saying. We see what people expect from state institutions - ensured justice and the effective functioning of each institution,\" he wrote on X. \"We discussed the necessary administrative and legislative decisions that would strengthen the work of each institution, resolve existing contradictions, and eliminate threats. Everyone will work together. At the political level, we will provide support.\" Mr Zelenskyy added that there with be an \"in-depth working meeting on the joint action plan\" next week, with the plan expected to be ready in two weeks. Following the meeting, the two anti-corruption agencies called for their independence to be restored and said that \"clear and unambiguous steps at the level of the law are necessary, which will return the guarantees cancelled by the parliament\".

        "Content": "The US and Japan have agreed a trade deal days ahead of the latest tariff deadline set by Donald Trump, while the European Union is more confident of a similar truce. Under the terms of the agreement, rather than all Japanese goods being hit with a 24% tax on entry to the US, they will instead be subject to a 15% tariff. Significantly, and unlike the US-UK deal, there is no cap on the number of Japanese cars subject to the agreed lower tariff. The levy on cars and car parts has been brought down from 25% to 15%, making it the first country to secure a reduction in the blanket 25% rate on vehicles. Cars make up more than a quarter of all Japan's exports to the US. Japanese steel and aluminium are still subject to a 25% tariff. Money blog: Rival set to overtake Morrisons Hours after the deal was announced, EU diplomats signalled they were more optimistic that a 15% baseline tariff deal with the US could be agreed - but preparations would continue to agree retaliatory measures in the event of the breakdown of talks. \n                  Trade war: Is  August escalation on - or will Trump chicken out?\n                 \n                  Jaguar Land Rover to cut hundreds of UK jobs\n                 \n                  Donald Trump announces 30% tariff on imports from EU\n                 It's just over a week until the 1 August pause on tariffs is due to end, itself a six-week extension to the 9 July 90-day freeze US President Donald Trump announced in April. The latest deal is seen a win for all parties as Japan is a major trading partner of the world's largest economy.  To make the deal happen, Japan agreed to a $550bn (£406bn) investment package of loans and guarantees from Japanese government-affiliated institutions in key sectors like pharmaceuticals and semiconductors. Japan will also increase purchases of US agricultural products such as rice. Market reaction Financial markets welcomed news of the Japan truce warmly, with stock markets rising globally. The value of a dollar ticked up, and in Japan, the benchmark stock exchange, the Nikkei, gained sizably, and closed up more than 3.5%. The index is comprised of many major carmakers, including Nissan, Honda, Mazda, Toyota, and Mitsubishi, which all rallied following the news. Other Asian stock indexes closed up, including Korea's Kospi, which rose nearly 0.44%, Hong Kong's Hang Seng, which increased more than 1.6%, and Thailand's SET index, which was up more than 2.3%. In London, the FTSE 100 hit a record high for the third consecutive day by the close. European stock markets were shut when hopes for a breakthrough in EU-US talks emerged but their US counterparts added to earlier gains."

        "Content": "\n          India reporter and producer\n              @nevilleskynews\n As India and Britain look set to sign a free trade agreement (FTA), some industries are disappointed and want a level playing field.  The Indian cabinet has given its consent to the deal as Prime Minister Narendra Modi is headed to the UK to sign it with his British counterpart Sir Keir Starmer. The pact, formally called a comprehensive economic and trade agreement, will now have to be ratified by the British parliament, which could take several months. Money blog: Rival set to overtake Morrisons  For Britain, this is the biggest and most economically significant bilateral trade deal since it left the European Union. The government says the deal is expected to add £4.8bn to the economy and £2.2bn in wages every year in the long run. Britain is the sixth-largest investor in India, with cumulative investments of around $36bn. There are at least 1,000 Indian companies operating in the country, employing more than 100,000 people, with a total investment of $2bn.At a time when countries are trying to navigate the turbulent effects of US President Donald Trump's tariff upheaval, this pact comes as a great economic boost for both countries. What's in the deal Once made law, the agreement will reduce 90% of tariffs on British exports to India that include whisky, cars, cosmetics, salmon, lamb, medical devices, electrical machinery, soft drinks, chocolate, and biscuits. India will get a zero-tariff deal on 99% of its tariff lines, covering nearly 100% of trade value. These include clothes, footwear and food products, including frozen prawns. With a zero tariff on textiles and apparel, Indian exports will get the same advantage as countries like Bangladesh and Vietnam.

The Double Contribution Convention (DCC) that ensures employees temporarily working in the UK for up to 3 years will continue paying social security contributions in their home country.  India will reduce duties from 100% to 10% for a limited number of imports of cars, while Britain will give access to its markets for electric and hybrid vehicles. Both countries have agreed to provide national treatment (same treatment as domestic companies) in select services, including telecom, construction and environment. Areas of concern But it's Scotch whisky that has been a bone of contention in the negotiations. The UK has bargained hard, and tariffs have been slashed from 150% to 75% while retaining the issue of maturation of Scotch.Whisky to be classified as Scotch needs to mature for at least three years. During this process, a small amount - dubbed the \"angel's share\" - evaporates due to climate and casks. Anant S Iyer, director general of the Confederation of Indian Alcoholic Beverage Companies (CIABC), representing Indian manufacturers, told Sky News: \"India has a tropical climate - the process of maturation is much faster. While in Scotland, the evaporation losses are around 2% a year, here it's about 10-15% yearly, depending on where you're distillery is based. \"So, a one-year-old mature Indian whisky could be equal to about a three-year-old Scotch whisky. This non-tariff barrier is something that's causing us a huge setback.\" Indian manufacturers lose a third of volume over a three-year maturation period, which makes it unviable for them.Mr Iyer says, \"while the FTA does bring cost savings for our blended whiskies, it will also open the floodgates for cheaper products from a plethora of Scotch brands in the UK\". India is the largest whisky market in the world by volume, and Scotch has just 3% of that. According to the Scotch Whisky Association, which represents over 90 companies, India is its largest export market by volume, with more than 192 million bottles exported in 2024. Despite the deal, there is still little clarity on issues of \"rules of origin\", a provision to help contain the dumping of goods; UK carbon tax, a concern for India as it could restrict the export of metal products; and the issue of international arbitration."

        "Content": "Tesla has started limited production on a cheaper model in a bid to boost sluggish demand after revealing its worst slump in quarterly sales for over a decade. The electric carmaker, effectively run part-time by founder and CEO Elon Musk for much of this year after his now-defunct spell at the heart of Donald Trump's government, reported a 12% drop in revenues over the second quarter of the year. Its update showed a total of $22.5bn sales, despite aggressive discounting and low-cost financing put in place to help shield Tesla from many headwinds. They include strong competition from cheaper electric vehicles and a backlash against Musk's former political alignment with the president. Sales and profits came in lower than analysts had predicted. Tesla said it was looking to ramp up production of the more affordable model during the second half of this year. It gave no further details but it is a nod to investor concerns that the appeal of Tesla's range is restricted when compared to that of competitors. \n                  Can Tesla survive without Trump?\n                 \n                  Revealed: The huge financial impact of Elon Musk's row with Donald Trump\n                 \n                  Musk's AI chatbot updated after posting antisemitic messages online\n                 The results were the first for shareholders to digest since the so-called bromance between Mr Musk and Donald Trump ended acrimoniously in June.  Tesla's shares remain almost 18% down over the year to date - lagging a recovery among rivals - and were flat in extended trading. The drag can mainly be explained by the 2025 sales slowdown, Tesla's particular exposure to the president's trade war and the often violent backlash against Musk's former role in the Trump administration which enacted big cuts to federal government spending. Globally, customers have been put off by interference by Musk in national elections, particularly in Germany, and stiff competition from cheaper alternatives to Tesla's electric car ranges.  While his departure from Washington allowed the tech tycoon to focus more on his vast business ventures, his beef with the president over the cost of the Big Beautiful tax and spending Bill has left Tesla exposed to retaliation from the White House. Recent analysis by Sky News showed the extent to which the company's profitability is threatened through the potential loss of billions of dollars in government subsidies - a sanction threatened by the president. The latest set of results showed a steady income from these so-called regulatory credits, amounting to $435m between April and June. That was down from the $458m reported for the same period last year.  Tesla had revealed earlier this month that production and deliveries covering the quarter were below expectations. A total of 384,122 Teslas were delivered in the period, a 13.5% fall on the same period last year. It marked the second consecutive quarterly sales decline and was not helped by the changeover to the refreshed Model Y.

Bloomberg News reported earlier on Wednesday that the company was in talks about operating a Robotaxi service in Nevada."

        "Content": "A judge in the US has rejected a justice department bid to unseal grand jury materials related to the sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. The US government had filed a motion to unseal grand jury transcripts related to the former financier, who took his own life while awaiting trial in 2019. Materials from grand juries are typically kept secret under US law, though exceptions can be made for a handful of reasons. In a ruling issued on Wednesday, US District Judge Robin Rosenberg said the justice department's request did not fall into any of these exceptions. It comes as Epstein's former girlfriend, Ghislaine Maxwell, has been officially subpoenaed to testify to the House Oversight Committee from prison. The grand juries on Epstein were held in Florida in 2005 and 2007, according to a court document. Grand juries assess evidence presented by prosecutors to decide whether there is \"probable cause\" to believe someone committed a crime, and if they should be put on trial.  A grand jury consists of 16 to 23 jurors and the proceedings are always carried out in private. A juror can serve up to 24 months and they meet on a few set days each week or month to consider multiple cases.  If a jury decides there is enough evidence, an indictment – a court document setting out charges – will be issued against the suspect. Under the US justice system, grand juries decide whether there is a criminal case against a person and whether they should be put on trial. \n                  Trump suing Wall Street Journal and Rupert Murdoch for $10bn after Epstein letter report\n                 \n                  All we know about Donald Trump and Jeffrey Epstein's 'friendship'\n                 \n                  Trump latest: White House says report about Trump being in Epstein files 'fake news' \n                 In 2007, prosecutors agreed not to bring federal charges against Epstein in exchange for him agreeing to plead guilty to state charges of solicitation of prostitution, for which he served 13 months in prison. Last Friday, Donald Trump said attorney general Pam Bondi had been asked to release the transcripts because of \"the ridiculous amount of publicity given to Jeffrey Epstein\". The Department of Justice said criminal cases against Epstein and Maxwell were a matter of public interest. The department previously said it had around 200 documents relating to Epstein and that the FBI had thousands more. It is unknown how much of this is grand jury testimony. The judge's decision is the first ruling in a series of attempts by President Trump's administration to release more information on the case amid calls by some in his MAGA group of supporters for the full details of Epstein's activities to be released. Mr Trump has faced renewed scrutiny over his relationship with Epstein since his administration's U-turn on the so-called \"Epstein files\". Read more:All we know about the 'friendship'Trump denies writing birthday letter to Epstein The MAGA movement had accused the Biden administration of suppressing the extent of Epstein's crimes and Mr Trump pledged to release the files during his second presidential term. But after a review of the evidence, the justice department said recently that no \"further disclosure would be appropriate or warranted\". As pressure has grown for Mr Trump to act, there has been increased attention paid to claims he was friends with Epstein - a relationship he denies. The Wall Street Journal (WSJ) last week published a story saying Mr Trump wrote a bawdy letter to Epstein to give him as a 50th birthday present in 2003. Mr Trump responded by filing a lawsuit against Rupert Murdoch, who owns the WSJ, two WSJ reporters and the publication's owner, News Corp, as well as saying the letter was a \"fake\". The summons for Ghislaine Maxwell from the House Oversight Committee is for a deposition to occur on 11 August. Chairman of the committee, Republican James Comer said: \"I have issued a subpoena to Ghislaine Maxwell for a deposition to occur at Federal Correctional Institution Tallahassee on August 11, 2025. \"The Department of Justice is cooperating and will help facilitate the deposition at the prison.\""

        "Content": " A man who murdered four University of Idaho students in November 2022 has been sentenced to life in prison - as the mother of one of his victims expressed her disappointment that he won't be executed. Bryan Kohberger, a 30-year-old former criminal justice student, initially denied the killings but later pleaded guilty as part of a deal that meant he would avoid the death penalty. Kohberger sneaked into the rented home in Moscow, Idaho, which is not far from the university campus, through a kitchen sliding door and murdered Ethan Chapin, Xana Kernodle, Madison Mogen and Kaylee Goncalves. He has never revealed his motive and it is not clear why he spared two roommates who were in the home. Post-mortem examinations showed the four who died were stabbed multiple times and were likely asleep when they were attacked - with some sustaining defensive wounds. Kohberger was arrested at his parents' home in Pennsylvania around six weeks after the killings following a nationwide search. Judge Steven Hippler sentenced Kohberger to four life sentences without parole for four counts of first-degree murder at Idaho's Fourth District Court in Boise, the state capital, today. He was also given a 10-year sentence for burglary. Kohberger declined the opportunity to give a statement to the court where he could have finally revealed why he carried out the murders. A 'delusional, pathetic, hypochondriac loser' Family members of the victims gave statements in court today ahead of the sentencing - with the murderer's mother Maryann Kohberger also in attendance for the hearing. Ms Kohberger quietly wept at times as the other parents described their grief. Ms Goncalves' mother Kristi Goncalves said she was disappointed that Kohberger won't be executed by firing squad but revelled in how he would suffer in prison. \"You will always be remembered as a loser, an absolute failure,\" she said. \"Hell will be waiting,\" she added. Alivea Goncalves, the victim's sister, drew applause after belittling Kohberger, who remained expressionless as she insulted him. \"You didn't win, you just exposed yourself as the coward you are,\" she said. \"You're a delusional, pathetic, hypochondriac loser.\" Steve Goncalves, the victim's father, spoke to Kohberger directly and said: \"Today we are here to finish what you started.\" Kohberger nodded subtly in response. Mr Goncalves added: \"You tried to break our community apart, you tried to plant fear, you tried to divide us. You failed.\" In a statement read on her behalf by her lawyer, Ms Mogen's mother Karen Laramie said: \"Any one of us would have given our own life to have been outshone by hers.\" Ms Laramie declined to address Kohberger directly, as he remained expressionless, but closed her statement by saying the family might never forgive him or \"ask for mercy\" for what he did. \"His acts are too heinous,\" her statement read. 'Too terrified to close my eyes' Bethany Funke, who survived the attack, said about her roommates in a statement to the court: \"I hated and still hate that they are gone, but for some reason, I am still here and I got to live. I still think about this every day. Why me? Why did I get to live, and not them?\" She described one of the victims, Ms Kernodle, as \"one in a million. She was the life of the party\". Much of her statement was devoted to remembering her four close friends who died - recounting the nights they spent binge-watching reality television, making dinner together, going to parties at their university and the love that they had for each other. Her testimony reduced many at the hearing to tears. Dylan Mortensen, the second surviving roommate, said in court that she has panic attacks that force her to relive the trauma of what she experienced. She said: \"I was too terrified to close my eyes, terrified that if I blinked, someone might be there. I made escape plans everywhere I went... He may have shattered parts of me but I'm still putting myself back together piece by piece.\" Ms Mortensen described Kohberger as being a \"hollow vessel, something less than human... A body without empathy, without remorse\". Kohberger's head bobbed slightly as she spoke. Trump administration condemns 'vicious and evil killer' White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt addressed the sentencing of Kohberger at a news briefing this evening. Ms Leavitt started the briefing with condolences to the families of the victims and called Kohberger a \"vicious and evil killer\". \"If it were up to the president, he would have forced this monster to publicly explain why he chose to steal these innocent souls,\" Ms Leavitt said. How police caught Kohberger The small farming community of Moscow, in the northern Idaho panhandle, had not had a homicide in about five years when the murders took place. The killings grabbed headlines around the world as police searched for Kohberger across the US. Police arrested him after investigators said they matched his DNA to genetic material recovered from a knife sheath found at the crime scene. They were also able to access mobile phone data to pinpoint his movements on the night of the killings. Online shopping records showed that Kohberger had purchased a military-style knife months earlier - as well as a sheath like the one found at the scene."

Mr Trump rescinded Mr Biden's executive order aimed at promoting competition, protecting consumers and ensuring AI was not used for misinformation. He also rescinded Mr Biden's so-called AI diffusion rule, which capped the amount of American AI computing capacity some countries were allowed to obtain via US AI chip imports. The Trump plan also aims to block the government from doing business with tech companies unless they \"ensure that their systems are objective and free from top-down ideological bias\". Mr Trump's AI czar, David Sacks, has been criticising \"woke AI\" for more than a year. Demand for power in the US is hitting record highs this year after nearly two decades of stagnation as the number of AI and cloud computing data centres expands across the country. The tech industry has been pushing to loosen rules to get its computing facilities connected to power sources. But the AI building boom has also led to more demand for fossil fuel production, which contributes to global warming."

        "Content": " A former US soldier who was employed to work within the Gaza aid system approved by Israel has claimed he saw security personnel shoot at Palestinians at a distribution centre. The unnamed American man, who served for 25 years in the US army, has alleged he witnessed force being used against unarmed innocent civilians in the Gaza Strip. \"There is no fixing this, this needs to be put an end to,\" he said in a video aired by Israeli free-to-air TV station Channel 12. It comes as the United Nations criticised an aid distribution scheme run by the US-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF) that has been supplying aid in the Strip since late May, claiming it is a \"sadistic death trap\" where \"snipers open fire randomly on crowds\". More than 1,000 people have been reported killed while trying to receive food aid since the end of May, according to the UN, with the territory facing a starvation crisis. The unnamed American claimed that as Palestinians were finishing getting their aid, security personnel \"began shooting in their direction, shooting at them, shooting at their feet… to get them to leave\". In another incident, he said a man was on his hands and knees picking up individual needles when security personnel wanted Palestinians to leave the site. \n                  Gaza faces 'man-made' mass starvation due to Israeli aid blockade, World Health Organization says\n                 \n                  More than 100 people die of hunger in Gaza, including 80 children, say Palestinian officials\n                 \n                  Gaza food situation 'worst it's ever been', charity says - as tank attack reportedly kills 12 at camp\n                 He alleged a contractor \"sprayed an entire can of pepper spray into his face - that's lethal\". He also recounted a third incident, describing how he was standing next to two women when a contractor threw a stun grenade and it landed between him and the women. \"This thing hit her and she just drops, just lifeless, collapsed to the ground. It looked like she had been killed\".  He said it was at that point that he decided he could no longer be part of the distribution system. Earlier this month, the Associated Press (AP) reported that it spoke anonymously to two US contractors guarding aid distribution sites who said their colleagues regularly threw stun grenades and pepper spray in the direction of the Palestinians. They said the security staff hired were often unqualified, unvetted, heavily armed and seemed to have an open licence to do whatever they wished, the AP reported. Videos provided by one of the contractors and taken at the sites showed hundreds of Palestinians crowded between metal gates, jostling for aid amid the sound of bullets and stun grenades and the sting of pepper spray, the agency added. The unnamed American man speaking to Channel 12 said the centres are in remote areas. \"The sites were not set up in locations, nor were they set up in a way that was conducive to distributing or delivering humanitarian aid to a needy population,\" he said. Residents are not allowed there by car and so people are on foot, he added. \"Most of them don't have shoes, no water, going through active warzone areas.\" Read more:Gaza faces 'man-made' mass starvation due to blockade - WHO'More than 100 people die of hunger in Gaza'Israeli soldier describes arbitrary killing of civilians in Gaza  He also said that if the United Nations method of aid distribution had the support, security and coordination that the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF) is getting, then the UN process would be very successful. UNRWA, the UN relief agency for Gaza, has criticised the US-backed aid distribution scheme run by GHF that has been supplying aid since late May, when Israel, which controls supplies into the territory, lifted an 11-week blockade. UNRWA Commissioner General Philippe Lazzarini said: \"The so-called 'GHF' distribution scheme is a sadistic death trap. Snipers open fire randomly on crowds as if they are given a licence to kill.\"  The GHF uses private US security and logistics companies and largely bypasses a UN-led system that Israel alleges has let Hamas-led militants loot aid shipments intended for civilians. Hamas denies the allegation. Journalists are not able to access GHF sites, which are located in Israeli military-controlled zones. When the AP ran its allegations earlier this month, it said it could not independently verify the contractors' stories. Sky News has not been able to independently verify the latest allegations. The GHF said in a statement: \"This is a disgruntled former contractor who was terminated for misconduct a month ago. GHF launched an immediate investigation as soon as these allegations were brought to our attention. Based on time-stamped video footage and witness statements, we have concluded that the claims made are categorically false. \"At no point were civilians under fire at a GHF distribution site. The gunfire heard in the video was confirmed to have originated from the IDF, which was outside the immediate vicinity of the GHF site. \"The gunfire was not directed at individuals, and no one was shot or injured. We take the safety and security of our operational sites extremely seriously. When behaviour falls short of our standards, we take action. The contractor seen shouting in the video is no longer part of our operations. \"We remain focused on our core mission - delivering food to the people of Gaza in a safe, direct, and uninterrupted manner, as we have done since launching operations on 27 May. Since then, we have distributed nearly 85 million meals to residents of the Gaza Strip.\""

        "Content": "The already infamous 'Alligator Alcatraz' immigration detention centre in Florida has been compared to a \"dog cage\" amid concerns over conditions there. Once destined to be the world's largest airport, the facility has instead become a symbol of the White House's determination to deport migrants from America which it says do not have a right to be in the country. One detainee described feeling \"in a state of torture\" while a family member of another said \"not even sunlight gets in\". Supporters of President Donald Trump's harsh stance on immigration have praised the new detention centre, in particular how natural obstacles in the surrounding Everglades such as alligators make escape difficult. But for critics, it's a dehumanising place that will cost hundreds of millions of dollars to run each year. Stories from inside Alligator Alcatraz \"It's like a dog cage,\" says detainee Rafael Collado, speaking to reporters on Tuesday over the phone from inside the facility. \n                  US judge rejects justice department bid to unseal Epstein grand jury materials\n                 \n                  Man who murdered four University of Idaho students in 2022 jailed for life\n                 \n                  Donald Trump declares US is going to 'win' AI race as administration unveils action plan\n                 In the comments, reported by Sky News' US sister outlet NBC News, he said that a combination of floodwater from recent storms, limited access to showers and poor sanitation have caused him to get fungus on his feet. He said detainees are stripped naked every time they are moved to a different cell and there was not a set schedule for him to take his blood pressure medication. At this point, he said he was being told by a guard to hang up and ended the call.

Mexican father Martin Gonzalez told local radio station W that his sons, Carlos and Alejandro, were now held in the detention centre. \"It's really bad. The facility is completely closed, not even sunlight gets in,\" Mr Gonzalez said. \"The lights are on 24-7, so they don't even know if it's day or night.\" Another detainee, Juan Palma, spoke to NBC Miami from inside Alligator Alcatraz on Monday. \"I feel like my life is in danger,\" Mr Palma, who is Cuban, said. He described feeling \"in a state of torture,\" being swarmed by mosquitoes during his sleep and unable to tell night from day because the facility's fluorescent lights are always on. US government denies accusations US Department of Homeland Security spokesperson, Tricia McLaughlin, denied all allegations of inhumane conditions at Alligator Alcatraz and at immigration detention centres across the nation. She told NBC: \"All detainees are provided with proper meals, medical treatment, and have opportunities to communicate with their family members and lawyers. \"Ensuring the safety, security, and well-being of individuals in our custody is a top priority.\" The Dade-Collier airport was once destined to be the world's largest airport and would have been five times the size of New York City's JFK, but it never fulfilled its potential. Instead, the 39-square-mile facility located about 50 miles from Miami has been used as a training facility for years - until now. \"This is an old, virtually abandoned airport facility right in the middle of the Everglades,\" Florida's attorney general James Uthmeier said as he introduced it last month. \"I call it: Alligator Alcatraz.\" He touted it as an \"efficient, low-cost opportunity\" to build a \"temporary\" detention centre \"because you don't need to invest that much in the perimeter\". It's believed that the facility could house 5,000 detainees when up and running and, according to CNN, will cost $450m (£328m) annually."

        "Content": "The US and Japan have agreed a trade deal days ahead of the latest tariff deadline set by Donald Trump, while the European Union is more confident of a similar truce. Under the terms of the agreement, rather than all Japanese goods being hit with a 24% tax on entry to the US, they will instead be subject to a 15% tariff. Significantly, and unlike the US-UK deal, there is no cap on the number of Japanese cars subject to the agreed lower tariff. The levy on cars and car parts has been brought down from 25% to 15%, making it the first country to secure a reduction in the blanket 25% rate on vehicles. Cars make up more than a quarter of all Japan's exports to the US. Japanese steel and aluminium are still subject to a 25% tariff.

The latest deal is seen a win for all parties as Japan is a major trading partner of the world's largest economy.  To make the deal happen, Japan agreed to a $550bn (£406bn) investment package of loans and guarantees from Japanese government-affiliated institutions in key sectors like pharmaceuticals and semiconductors. Japan will also increase purchases of US agricultural products such as rice. Market reaction Financial markets welcomed news of the Japan truce warmly, with stock markets rising globally. The value of a dollar ticked up, and in Japan, the benchmark stock exchange, the Nikkei, gained sizably, and closed up more than 3.5%. The index is comprised of many major carmakers, including Nissan, Honda, Mazda, Toyota, and Mitsubishi, which all rallied following the news. Other Asian stock indexes closed up, including Korea's Kospi, which rose nearly 0.44%, Hong Kong's Hang Seng, which increased more than 1.6%, and Thailand's SET index, which was up more than 2.3%. In London, the FTSE 100 hit a record high for the third consecutive day by the close. European stock markets were shut when hopes for a breakthrough in EU-US talks emerged but their US counterparts added to earlier gains."

Menendez and his brother, Lyle Menendez, have been serving life sentences without parole after being convicted of murdering their parents in their Beverly Hills mansion in 1989. The siblings were thrust back into the spotlight in September last year when Netflix released both a documentary and a miniseries on the case. A judge resentenced the brothers to 50 years to life in May - making them immediately eligible for parole. They are scheduled to appear in front of a California parole board on 21 and 22 August. Erik Menendez was taken to a medical facility on Friday and remained there on Tuesday \"in fair condition\", the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation confirmed. Menendez's lawyer, Mark Geragos, told US website TMZ his client had a \"serious medical condition\" and should be given prison furlough, which essentially amounts to authorised leave. He did not provide further details on the condition but said releasing Menendez was the \"only fair and equitable thing to do\" so he has time to properly prepare for his parole hearing. California governor Gavin Newsom's office and a representative for the family declined to comment when contacted by news agency Associated Press.

        "Content": " Two traders jailed for rigging benchmark interest rates have had their convictions overturned by the Supreme Court. Tom Hayes, 45, was handed a 14-year jail sentence - cut to 11 years on appeal - in 2015, which was one of the toughest ever to be imposed for white-collar crime in UK history. The former Citigroup and UBS trader, along with Carlo Palombo, 46, who was jailed for four years in 2019 over rigging the Euribor interest rates, took their cases to the country's highest court after the Court of Appeal dismissed their appeals last year. The Supreme Court unanimously allowed Mr Hayes' appeal, overturning his 2015 conviction of eight counts of conspiracy to defraud by manipulating Libor, a now-defunct benchmark interest rate. Ex-vice president of euro rates at Barclays bank Mr Palombo's conviction for conspiring with others to submit false or misleading Euribor submissions between 2005 and 2009 was also quashed. Mr Hayes, who served five and a half years in prison before being released on licence in 2021, described the \"incredible feeling\" after the ruling. \"My faith in the criminal justice system at times was likely destroyed and it has been restored by the justices from the Supreme Court today and I think it's only right that more criminal appeals should be heard at this level,\" he said. \n                  'Everyone's on edge': Epping braces for another hotel protest\n                 \n                  Jay Slater inquest resumes after final effort to trace witnesses - all you need to know\n                 \n                  Off-the-shelf medical tests are failing to back up accuracy promises with evidence, study finds\n                 Both he and Mr Palombo have been described as \"scapegoats\" for the 2008 financial crisis, but Mr Hayes said: \"We literally had nothing to do with it.\" A spokesperson for the Serious Fraud Office (SFO), which opposed the appeals, said it would not be seeking a retrial. In 2012, the SFO began criminal investigations into traders it suspected of manipulating the Libor and Euribor benchmark interest rates. Mr Hayes was the first person to be prosecuted by the SFO, which brought prosecutions against 20 people between 2013 and 2019, seven of whom were convicted at trial, two pleaded guilty and 11 were acquitted. He had also been facing criminal charges in the US but these were dismissed after two other men involved in a similar case had their convictions reversed in 2022. Mr Hayes, a gifted mathematician who is autistic, was described at his Southwark Crown Court trial as the \"ringmaster\" at the centre of an enormous fraud to manipulate benchmark interest rates and boost his own six-figure earnings. He has always maintained that the Libor rates he requested fell within a permissible range and that his conduct was common at the time and condoned by bosses. Mr Hayes and Mr Palombo argued their convictions depended on a definition of Libor and Euribor which assumes there is an absolute legal bar on a bank's commercial interests being taken into account when setting rates. The panel of five Supreme Court justices found there was \"ample evidence\" for a jury to convict the two men if it had been properly directed. But in an 82-page judgment, Lord Leggatt said jury direction errors made both convictions unsafe, adding: \"That misdirection undermined the fairness of the trial.\" Lawyers representing Mr Hayes and Mr Palombo said the ruling could open the door for the seven others found guilty to have their convictions overturned and that there were grounds for a public inquiry."

        "Content": "\n          Business and economics correspondent\n              @gurpreetnarwan\n  The city traders wrongfully convicted in the aftermath of the financial crisis have spoken out about their decade-long battle for justice, claiming they were scapegoats. Tom Hayes was the first of nine traders to prosecuted by the Serious Fraud Office. In 2012, he was accused of rigging Libor - an interest rate on loans and financial contracts that was used throughout the financial system. The rate was determined daily, based on submissions from several large banks. Money latest: One million owed refunds from HMRC  Mr Hayes was originally sentenced to 14 years in jail, one of the toughest sentences ever handed out for white collar crime. He served more than five years in prison, including at the high security prison Belmarsh. Speaking to Sky News after the Supreme Court overturned the conviction, Mr Hayes said: \"I came out [of prison] to a son who was nine years old who I left when he was three. My marriage broke down whilst I was in prison. My mental health broke down while I was in prison.\" \n                  Lord Myners dies: Tributes paid to former Labour minister who was brought in to tackle 2008 financial crash\n                 \n                  BoE deputy governor: Banks could still fail - but safely\n                 \n                  Northern Rock shareholders 'must be compensated'\n                 Mr Hayes said he was made responsible for damage caused by the financial crisis. \"There was this zeitgeist that existed where they wanted to send bankers to prison... we were unlucky,\" he said. He was joined by Carlo Palombo, who was convicted in 2019 for rigging Euribor, the Euro Libor rate. Mr Palombo said he spent most of his days in a small cell that he shared with another inmate at Wandsworth Prison. He said he was the victim of a \"purge\" by banks and regulators as they sought to absolve themselves of the consequences of the crash. \"The stuff of which I was accused and convicted was something that was done completely openly by absolutely every single person… it was just a normal business practice of the bank,\" he said. Supreme Court judges said the two men did not receive fair trials because the juries were misdirected in the original cases. Essentially, they had been told their behaviour was dishonest without reaching that conclusion themselves. Both men are now trying to move on with their lives. Mr Hayes said he wanted to move to the sea and rebuild his family."

        "Content": "The US and Japan have agreed a trade deal days ahead of the latest tariff deadline set by Donald Trump, while the European Union is more confident of a similar truce. Under the terms of the agreement, rather than all Japanese goods being hit with a 24% tax on entry to the US, they will instead be subject to a 15% tariff. Significantly, and unlike the US-UK deal, there is no cap on the number of Japanese cars subject to the agreed lower tariff. The levy on cars and car parts has been brought down from 25% to 15%, making it the first country to secure a reduction in the blanket 25% rate on vehicles. Cars make up more than a quarter of all Japan's exports to the US. Japanese steel and aluminium are still subject to a 25% tariff. Money blog: Rival set to overtake Morrisons Hours after the deal was announced, EU diplomats signalled they were more optimistic that a 15% baseline tariff deal with the US could be agreed - but preparations would continue to agree retaliatory measures in the event of the breakdown of talks. \n                  Trade war: Is  August escalation on - or will Trump chicken out?\n                 \n                  Jaguar Land Rover to cut hundreds of UK jobs\n                 \n                  Donald Trump announces 30% tariff on imports from EU\n                 It's just over a week until the 1 August pause on tariffs is due to end, itself a six-week extension to the 9 July 90-day freeze US President Donald Trump announced in April. The latest deal is seen a win for all parties as Japan is a major trading partner of the world's largest economy.  To make the deal happen, Japan agreed to a $550bn (£406bn) investment package of loans and guarantees from Japanese government-affiliated institutions in key sectors like pharmaceuticals and semiconductors. Japan will also increase purchases of US agricultural products such as rice. Market reaction Financial markets welcomed news of the Japan truce warmly, with stock markets rising globally. The value of a dollar ticked up, and in Japan, the benchmark stock exchange, the Nikkei, gained sizably, and closed up more than 3.5%. The index is comprised of many major carmakers, including Nissan, Honda, Mazda, Toyota, and Mitsubishi, which all rallied following the news. Other Asian stock indexes closed up, including Korea's Kospi, which rose nearly 0.44%, Hong Kong's Hang Seng, which increased more than 1.6%, and Thailand's SET index, which was up more than 2.3%. In London, the FTSE 100 hit a record high for the third consecutive day by the close. European stock markets were shut when hopes for a breakthrough in EU-US talks emerged but their US counterparts added to earlier gains."

        "Content": "\n          City editor\n              @MarkKleinmanSky\n The London-listed fashion retailer Boohoo Group is close to securing a £175m refinancing boost in a deal that will revive memories of one of Britain's most notorious private equity takeovers. Sky News has learnt that Boohoo, which has been embroiled in a tussle to rename itself as Debenhams, is in advanced talks to secure a significant chunk of debt from TPG, the US-based investment giant. The discussions are said to be close to an agreement, although precise details, including the ultimate size of the refinancing package and the extent of TPG's contribution, were unclear on Wednesday evening. Money latest: One million owed refunds from HMRC If confirmed, it will re-establish TPG as a Debenhams stakeholder more than 20 years after the buyout firm was part of a consortium which delisted it from the London Stock Exchange. In 2003, TPG, CVC Capital Partners and Merrill Lynch Private Equity paid £1.7bn to take the department store chain private in a deal which saddled the retailer with over £1bn of debt. They then relisted it three years later in a flotation which proved to be lucrative for the private equity firms but became a poster-child for the financial engineering adopted by the industry. \n                  Tesla looks to cheaper model as revenue suffers worst drop in over a decade\n                 \n                  City traders jailed for interest rate rigging have convictions overturned after 10-year fight\n                 \n                  Cleared City traders blame 'purge' as they hit out at rate-rigging prosecutions\n                 Debenhams' financial performance deteriorated over the following decade, however, amid rapidly shifting consumer behaviour. In 2019, the company fell into administration for the first time, before collapsing again soon after the start of the COVID pandemic the following year. Boohoo, which saw its own valuation soar as consumer and investor demand soared for online fashion retailers, snapped up the Debenhams brand in 2020. That deal infuriated the Frasers Group tycoon Mike Ashley, who had fought a running battle with the Debenhams board as he attempted to buy the company. Earlier this year, Mr Ashley used Frasers' big minority stake in Boohoo to vote down its plans to change its legal name to Debenhams - although the company is now using the name as its corporate brand. The group's refinancing needs saw it appoint Interpath Advisory earlier this year. In May, the Telegraph reported that Boohoo was talking to expensive high-yield lenders about providing a £50m chunk of debt to the company. TPG and Interpath declined to comment, while Boohoo did not respond to an enquiry from Sky News."

        "Content": "\n          Political reporter\n              @TimJ_B\n Sir Keir Starmer is facing a nine-day deadline to avoid Labour MPs being banned from Sikh events and gurdwaras. Hundreds of Sikh groups are threatening to \"no platform\" Labour MPs if the government does not announce an inquiry into alleged UK involvement in the Golden Temple massacre, and other \"anti-Sikh measures\" carried out by India during the Thatcher era, according to a letter seen by Sky News. It comes as the Sikh Federation continues to call for the probe - saying it was promised in the run-up to the general election last year. Politics latest: Labour drove 'wedges' in communities The calls relate to questions around what part the UK and British special forces played in the 1984 killings, in which hundreds of Sikhs died after the Indian military entered the temple complex where separatists had sought refuge. Previous limited investigations under David Cameron found a single British officer provided advice to the Indian government before the raid - but there was \"no evidence of UK government involvement in the operation itself\". Writing to Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer on Tuesday, the Sikh Federation said it wanted a timeline of a judge-led inquiry to be confirmed by 31 July - Friday next week. \n                  UK and India about to sign landmark trade deal but not everyone's happy\n                 \n                  Fauja Singh: Man arrested over hit-and-run death of world's 'oldest' marathon runner\n                 \n                  Backlash as Air India crash report points to possible human error - here's what experts think\n                 The letter was sent to Downing Street ahead of a visit from Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi to the UK. There have been allegations that Mr Modi's government has attempted to stymie the separatist Sikh movement, including through repression in the UK and other countries like Canada. The allegations have been denied by the Indian government.

Angela Rayner posted on social media ahead of last year's election that \"Labour stands with the Sikh community in calling for an inquiry into the historic role Britain played\" in the raid on the Golden Temple. If the request for an inquiry timeline is not met by the government, the Sikh Federation told the prime minister it would \"issue guidance in August on how Gurdwaras and Sikh organisations should implement the no platform policy in Gurdwaras and Sikh events that will in practice start to impact from September onwards\". This guidance would apply to all Labour MPs who do not publicly support the implementation of an inquiry - including ministers. The federation's letter claims the issue was raised with Sir Keir earlier this month by a Labour MP and the prime minister \"responded positively\". 👉Listen to The World with Richard Engel and Yalda Hakim on your podcast app👈 Among the close to 500 signatories to the letter from the Sikh Federation is the Guru Nanak Gurdwara in Smethwick, West Midlands, where Sir Keir was pictured campaigning for the leadership of the Labour Party. There are thought to be just over half a million Sikhs in the UK - with analysis suggestion members of the religion tend to support Labour. The government declined to comment."

        "Content": "\n          Political correspondent\n              @tamcohen\n  Social media limits for children are being planned by the government to tackle \"compulsive\" screen time, the technology secretary has told Sky News.  Peter Kyle said he was concerned about \"the overall amount of time kids spend on these apps\" as well as the content they see. A two-hour cap per platform is being seriously considered after meetings with current and former employees of tech companies. A night-time or school-time curfew has also been discussed. Children would be blocked from accessing apps such as TikTok or Snapchat once they have hit the limit, rather than just reminded of how long they have been scrolling, it is understood. An announcement on screen time is expected this autumn. Mr Kyle said: \"I'll be making an announcement on these things in the near future. But I am looking very carefully about the overall time kids spend on these apps. \"I think some parents feel a bit disempowered about how to actually make their kids healthier online. \n                  Government to announce new scheme as it ramps up AI adoption with backing from Facebook owner Meta\n                 \n                  AI tool used to test feelings about Botox will be rolled out by government\n                 \n                  Phone waiting times for public services could be cut in half after successful AI trial, minister suggests\n                 \"I think some kids feel that sometimes there is so much compulsive behaviour with interaction with the apps they need some help just to take control of their online lives and those are things I'm looking at really carefully. \"We talk a lot about a healthy childhood offline. We need to do the same online. I think sleep is very important, to be able to focus on studying is very important.\" He added that he wanted to stop children spending hours viewing content which \"isn't criminal, but it's unhealthy, the overuse of some of these apps\". \"I think we can incentivise the companies and we can set a slightly different threshold that will just tip the balance in favour of parents not always being the ones who are just ripping phones out of the kids' hands and having a really awkward, difficult conversation around it,\" he added. Mr Kyle spoke exclusively to Sky News after meeting with a group of pupils from Darlington who have spent a year participating in regular focus groups about smartphones and social media, organised by their Labour MP Lola McEvoy. They took part in a survey of 1,000 children from the town, mostly aged 14 and 15, which found that 40% of them spent at least six hours a day online. One in five spent as long as eight hours scrolling. Most of the under-16s (55%) had seen inappropriate sexual or violent content - often unprompted. And three-quarters of the under-16s had been contacted online by strangers. In the session in parliament, in which the children were asked what they were most concerned about, Jacob, 15, said: \"A lack of restrictions on screen time I would personally say, which leads to people scrolling for hours on Tiktok. \"People just glue their eyes to their phone and just spent hours on it, instead of seeing the real world.\" Tom, 17, said: \"I get the feeling you have to be quite tech savvy to protect your kids online. You have to go into the settings and work out each one. It should be the default. It needs to be straight away, day one.\" Matthew, 15, said: \"I think because everybody is online all the time and there's no real moderation to what people can say or what can be shared, it can really affect people's lives because it's always there. \"As soon as I wake up, I check my phone and until I go to bed. The only time I take a break is when I eat or am talking to someone.\" Some of the teenagers had spent 12 or even up to 16 hours a day online. Nathan, 15, said: \"When, for example, a 13-year-old is on their phone 'til midnight, you can't sleep, your body can't function properly and your mind is all over the place.\" But there was scepticism about what could be done. Charlotte, 17, said: \"If your parents sets a restriction on Instagram and say, 'right, you're coming off it now' - there's TikTok, there is Pinterest, there is Facebook, there's Snapchat, there so many different other ones, you can go on, and it just builds up and builds and builds up, and you end up sat there for the entire evening just on social media. I think we need harsher controls.\" Several of the pupils who met Mr Kyle detailed being contacted by adult strangers, either on social media apps or online gaming, in ways which made them feel uncomfortable. Science and technology reporter The tech already exists to make a ban like this a reality. On Friday, rules will start being enforced in the UK that will mean sites hosting harmful adult content will need to properly check the ages of their users. There are a number of ways companies could do that, including credit card checks, ID checks and AI facial age estimation. It is likely these are the same systems that would be used to keep teenagers off social media during certain hours, as suggested by Peter Kyle to Sky News. It's how Australia is looking into enforcing its total ban of under-16s on social media later this year - but the process isn't without controversy. Concerns around privacy are frequently raised as internet users worry about big tech companies storing even more of their personal data.  There are also questions about just how effective these age verification processes could actually be.  Tech like AI facial estimation can reliably age-check users - but teenagers may quickly work out how to circumvent the system using plugins and settings that could be a mystery to all but the savviest parents.\n At the moment, a lot of age-checking AI systems are trained to spot the difference between an adult and a child, and can do that to a high degree of accuracy. But while telling the visual difference between a 15-year-old and a 17-year-old is much harder, AI learns fast. Officials working on the UK's age verification scheme have suggested AI will soon be able to accurately verify the ages of under-18s, making a ban like this much more realistic. Mr Kyle said: \"It is madness, it is total madness, and many of the apps or the companies have taken action to restrict contacts that adults - particularly strangers - have with children, but we need to go further and I accept that. \"At the moment, I think the balance is tipped slightly in the wrong direction. Parents don't feel they have the skills, the tools or the ability to really have a grip on the childhood experience online, how much time, what they're seeing, they don't feel that kids are protected from unhealthy activity or content when they are online.\" The tech secretary is in the process of implementing the 2023 Online Safety Act, passed by the previous government. From this Friday, all platforms must introduce stronger protections for children online, including a legal requirement for all pornography sites accessed in the UK to have effective age verification in place - such as facial age estimation or ID checks. Mr Kyle added: \"I don't just want the base level set where kids aren't being criminally exploited and damaged, that shouldn't be the height of our aspirations. The height of our aspirations should be a healthy experience.\" Labour MP Lola McEvoy, who organised the focus group, said: \"I knew things were bad online for children and young people but their testimony revealed the extent of explicit, disturbing and toxic content that is now the norm. \"Their articulation of the changes they wanted to see was excellent and they've done our town and their generation proud.\" Laura Trott, the shadow education secretary, said the government's plans looked like \"more delay tactics\". \"This won't do enough to protect children from social media and smartphones,\" she said on X. \"It's simple: get phones out of the classroom and children off social media.\" Tiktok, Pinterest, Meta and Snapchat were contacted for comment, but none provided an on the record statement. The companies have accounts for under-16s with parental controls and some set reminders for screen time. TikTok has a 60-minute daily screen time limit for under-18s after which they must enter a password to continue, and a reminder to switch off at 10pm. The company say this is to support a healthy relationship with screen time. Pinterest have supported phone-free policies at schools, in the US and Canada and say they are looking to expand this elsewhere."

        "Content": "Donald Trump has declared the United States is going to \"win\" the artificial intelligence race, as his administration unveiled its AI Action Plan. The new blueprint is designed to speed up the building of energy-intensive data centres - which run AI products - by loosening environmental rules, while also vastly expanding the sale of AI technologies overseas. The plan, which includes 90 recommendations, comes as America attempts to maintain its edge over China, with both superpowers investing heavily in the industry to secure economic and military superiority. It calls for the export of US AI software and hardware abroad, as well as urging the removal of \"red tape\" that could be seen as stopping the industry from flourishing. In a speech in Washington DC, Mr Trump said: \"America is the country that started the AI race. And as president of the United States, I'm here today to declare that America is going to win it.\" He said the technological arms race with China was a fight that will define the 21st century.

An expansion in exports of AI products could benefit AI chip makers Nvidia and AMD as well as AI model giants Alphabet's Google, Microsoft, OpenAI and Facebook parent company Meta. Read more from Sky News:World court issues landmark ruling in climate court caseGovernment mulls two-hour screen time limit for children During his time in office, former president Joe Biden brought in restrictions on US exports of AI chips to China and other countries which America feared could divert the semiconductors to the Asian superpower. Mr Trump rescinded Mr Biden's executive order aimed at promoting competition, protecting consumers and ensuring AI was not used for misinformation. He also rescinded Mr Biden's so-called AI diffusion rule, which capped the amount of American AI computing capacity some countries were allowed to obtain via US AI chip imports. The Trump plan also aims to block the government from doing business with tech companies unless they \"ensure that their systems are objective and free from top-down ideological bias\". Mr Trump's AI czar, David Sacks, has been criticising \"woke AI\" for more than a year. Demand for power in the US is hitting record highs this year after nearly two decades of stagnation as the number of AI and cloud computing data centres expands across the country. The tech industry has been pushing to loosen rules to get its computing facilities connected to power sources. But the AI building boom has also led to more demand for fossil fuel production, which contributes to global warming."

        "Content": "\n          Climate reporter\n              @SeabrookClimate\n  The failure of countries to protect the planet from climate change may be a violation of international law, the UN's top court has said in a landmark ruling likely to shape climate litigation for years to come. In the world's biggest ever climate court case, the International Court of Justice (ICJ) on Wednesday also said countries damaged by climate change-fuelled extreme weather could be entitled to reparations in some cases. \"Failure of a state to take appropriate action to protect the climate system... may constitute an internationally wrongful act,\" Judge Yuji Iwasawa, the court president, said during the hearing. It wraps up the largest ever case heard by the ICJ in the Hague, which involved 96 countries, 10,000 pages of documents, 15 judges and two weeks of hearings in December.  Mr Iwasawa added a \"clean, healthy and sustainable environment\" is a human right - a verdict that may pave the way for countries to take each other to court for breaching that duty. Wednesday's findings have been claimed as a \"tremendous victory\" by campaigners and vulnerable nations like the Pacific islands of Vanuatu and Tuvalu, which are rapidly disappearing underwater, while footing the bill for climate damages caused by bigger, richer, more polluting countries. \n                  UK weather: Country set to have new heatwave - with temperatures over 30C in some areas, Met Office forecasts\n                 \n                  Prince William warns world's oceans are 'diminishing before our eyes' in call for urgent action\n                 \n                  More than 40% of Europe slides into drought, including pockets of Greece, southern Italy and Spain\n                 It will likely disappoint Global North countries - like the UK, Australia and Canada - who had told the judges in December that their climate responsibilities are limited to those set out in the Paris climate agreement. The 140-page long advisory opinion is non-binding, and it will take time to assess its true impact on climate action around the world. But observers say it sets a precedent for future court cases and opens the door for new types of lawsuits. Joana Setzer, climate litigation expert at the London School of Economics, said: \"For the first time, the world's highest court has made clear that states have a legal duty not only to prevent climate harm - but to fully repair it.\" She added: \"It adds decisive weight to calls for fair and effective climate reparations.\" Existing treaties like the Paris Agreement are widely perceived to not go far enough to tackle climate change, and progress on tackling emissions has gone at a snail's pace in comparison with the pace that scientists say is needed. Island nations, not content to \"go silently to our watery graves\", took the matter to the world's top court, asking for an advisory opinion on two things. Firstly, what countries are legally bound to do under international law to protect people and the planet from climate change, and secondly, what the penalties might be if they fail. The case started out as a campaign by 27 students studying law in Vanuatu in 2019. Eventually, the government there agreed to lobby the United Nations for the case, and in 2023 the UN General Assembly formally requested the ICJ to hear the case, backed by 132 countries. One of the students who initiated the campaign, Cynthia Houniuhi from the Solomon Islands, called it the \"start of a new chapter\". \"In five years or 10 years time, small islands like ours will cease to exist,\" she told Sky News. \"Imagine that for a young person, with hopes for the future, with hopes to have children... Will they get to see the islands that I lived on... or will I have to show pictures and say: 'This is where we used to be?' - I do not accept that.\" Danilo Garrido, legal counsel at Greenpeace International, said: \"This is the start of a new era of climate accountability at a global level.\" He said it will \"open the door for new cases, and hopefully bring justice to those, who despite having contributed the least to climate change, are already suffering its most severe consequences\"."

The height of our aspirations should be a healthy experience.\" Labour MP Lola McEvoy, who organised the focus group, said: \"I knew things were bad online for children and young people but their testimony revealed the extent of explicit, disturbing and toxic content that is now the norm. \"Their articulation of the changes they wanted to see was excellent and they've done our town and their generation proud.\" Laura Trott, the shadow education secretary, said the government's plans looked like \"more delay tactics\". \"This won't do enough to protect children from social media and smartphones,\" she said on X. \"It's simple: get phones out of the classroom and children off social media.\" Tiktok, Pinterest, Meta and Snapchat were contacted for comment, but none provided an on the record statement. The companies have accounts for under-16s with parental controls and some set reminders for screen time. TikTok has a 60-minute daily screen time limit for under-18s after which they must enter a password to continue, and a reminder to switch off at 10pm. The company say this is to support a healthy relationship with screen time. Pinterest have supported phone-free policies at schools, in the US and Canada and say they are looking to expand this elsewhere."

        "Content": "Fans have spoken of how Ozzy Osbourne was \"a local lad who done good\" as they remembered the singer in his hometown of Birmingham. People came to the Black Sabbath Bridge, which also features the Black Sabbath bench, to share their memories, pay respect and talk about why the heavy metal icon was important to them. Many left flowers, candles and messages to their hero, who died on Tuesday morning at the age of 76. Jake Brookes, 28, who has been a fan of the singer since he was 12 years old, said the singer's farewell concert for fans weeks ago was \"the perfect sendoff\". \"He got to say goodbye and we got to say goodbye back. There was not a dry eye at Villa Park. And for him to do it at home meant the world to him, meant the world to fans, and it was a mutual thank you and respect,\" he told Sky News's Midlands correspondent Shamaan Freeman-Powell. He said the rockstar will be remembered for his self-expression: \"He paved the way for artists today, even like Lady Gaga. You see theatrics, he was the original man that started it - this crazy guy on stage that you couldn't take your eyes off. So many frontmen around the world will have taken inspiration from what Ozzy did. \"I think his legacy will live on forever. So many bands, artists and celebrities have come out and said how much they love him, and I think he's worthy of that love. He has inspired millions and will continue to.\" Read more:Ozzy Osbourne obituaryBlack Sabbath, Elton John and Rod Stewart among music giants paying tribute Joe Savage said when he watched Osbourne perform a few weeks ago, he thought \"maybe he could do one more album\", but \"unfortunately that wasn't meant to be\". \"He, along with the other members of Black Sabbath, created a whole new genre. Fifty to sixty years down the line, it's still going strong. I think it will do for many more generations to come, thanks to Ozzy,\" he said. Gary Holbrooke, 70, described Osbourne as a \"born entertainer\" and \"fantastic person\". \"I'm just sorry to see him go,\" he said. \"I was shocked. Especially after he's done the Aston Villa reunion. To die a couple of weeks later, [the gig was] fantastic.\" Asked what he thought Osbourne's legacy would be, he said: \"Just a local lad who done good. He'll be sadly missed.\""

Both Wallace and Torode will still feature in the upcoming series, but it is understood that the edit will focus on the contestants. The amateur series of MasterChef will be aired on BBC One and BBC iPlayer from 6 August, but no decision has been made yet on airing the celebrity series and Christmas special, with plans to be confirmed later this year, the BBC said. A spokesperson for the broadcaster said airing the series \"has not been an easy decision in the circumstances and we appreciate not everyone will agree with it\". The broadcaster said showing the series \"in no way diminishes our view of the seriousness of the upheld findings against both presenters\", adding that it has been \"very clear on the standard of behaviour\" expected of employees. But the BBC believes that airing the series \"is the right thing to do for these cooks\". \"We want them to be properly recognised and give the audience the choice to watch the series,\" the spokesperson said. \n                  BBC reveals highest-earning stars - as pay list published\n                 \n                  Head of BBC addresses future of MasterChef - as annual report released\n                 \n                  John Torode responds to MasterChef sacking\n                 The broadcaster's statement comes a week after it announced that Torode's contract on MasterChef would not be renewed after an allegation he used an \"extremely offensive racist term\" was upheld. The 59-year-old presenter confirmed he was the subject of an allegation about using racist language that was upheld as part of a review carried out by law firm Lewis Silkin into the alleged behaviour of his MasterChef co-presenter Wallace. Torode insisted he had \"absolutely no recollection\" of the alleged incident involving him, and he \"did not believe that it happened,\" adding \"racial language is wholly unacceptable in any environment\". The report, commissioned by MasterChef's production company Banijay UK, found 45 out of 83 allegations against Wallace, 60, were substantiated.  Wallace said he's \"deeply sorry\" for causing any distress, and he never set out to \"harm or humiliate\". While the majority of the substantiated claims related to inappropriate sexual language and humour, one related to \"unwanted physical contact\", and three were about being \"in a state of undress\".

In a statement, Wallace said \"some of (his) humour and language missed the mark\", but he said, after nearly 20 years on MasterChef, \"I now see that certain patterns, shaped by traits I've only recently begun to understand, may have been misread\"."
