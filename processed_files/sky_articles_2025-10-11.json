        "Content": "\n          Lead world news presenter\n              @SkyYaldaHakim\n  The thought of Hamas publicly thanking Donald Trump for his peacemaking efforts would have been impossible to imagine just days ago.  This, after all, is the president who vowed \"all Hell\" would be unleashed on Hamas if the hostages weren't returned. And yet, in an exclusive interview with Hamas's senior leader Dr Basem Naim, that's exactly what happened. \"Without the personal interference of President Trump in this case, I don't think that it would happen to reach this end, the end of the war,\" Dr Naim told me. \"Therefore, yes, we thank President Trump and his personal efforts to interfere and to pressure Israel to make an end of this massacre and slaughtering.\" He was speaking from his office in Doha, where last month he and a group of Hamas leaders, meeting to discuss Trump's plan, were targeted in an Israeli air strike. He survived the attack, and in the days that followed, international condemnation seems to have helped build momentum towards the ceasefire deal finally being reached. \n                  Police use Public Order Act to keep rival protesters apart at London demonstration marking two years since Gaza war began\n                 \n                  Could the Gaza deal lead to something even bigger?\n                 \n                  Hamas official thanks Donald Trump for ceasefire deal - but tells Sky News Tony Blair not welcome\n                 Serious pressure This is the unpredictable, and frankly unbelievable, world of global politics right now: A Hamas leader, who narrowly escaped assassination just weeks ago, telling me he believes Donald Trump is the key man to ensure Israel sticks to the ceasefire agreement. Let's be clear: Hamas is under serious pressure. It is facing calls to step away from governing Gaza and disarming altogether, not just from Israel and the US but regional powers as well.  Gaza needs an enormous amount of aid, investment and reconstruction. A humanitarian catastrophe which has killed 67,000 Gazans, destroyed or damaged 90% of people's homes and forced 1.2 million people to become displaced. The message from major international powers is that their long-term commitment will require a new ruling force in the strip. Dr Naim told me the organisation was willing to cede political control but rejected calls to lay down their arms until a comprehensive agreement was reached.  \"We are ready to hand over government, we are ready to be totally away from any government or government body but when it comes to Hamas as an entity, as a Palestinian liberation movement, I think no one can overcome or exclude Hamas,\" he said. \"Our weapons are only going to be handed over only to the hands of a Palestinian state and our fighters will be integrated into a Palestinian national army. \"Before that, no one has the right to deny us the right to resist the occupation by all means.\" Read more:All the hostages believed to be alive and who are due for releaseCould the Gaza deal lead to something even bigger? The negotiators of Wednesday's deal in the Egyptian resort of Sharm el-Sheikh may choose to ignore those comments for the time being. There is, after all, undeniable relief that the fighting has finally stopped, the hostages will be released and 2 million Gazans can sleep safely without the fear of Israeli bombardment. But for the next phase of this deal to be realised, it will need clear answers as to who runs Gaza? Donald Trump and his team believe former British prime minister Sir Tony Blair will have some role to play, something the Hamas official was quick to dismiss. \"To be honest, when I hear the name Tony Blair, I can see this could be Balfour Declaration 2… I think all Palestinians, not only in Hamas, not only in Gaza, have very bad, and very negative image of him. \"And I do not believe that he will be very welcome.\" There will be many who read his comments as proof the organisation has no intention of relinquishing control of Gaza. Hamas itself may feel some sense of achievement that it was the only representative of the Palestinian political factions involved in the negotiations earlier this week. But the key question now is, who will be responsible for the governance of Gaza and the daunting security challenges that millions are facing."

        "Content": " Actress Diane Keaton, who starred in films including The Godfather and Annie Hall, has died aged 79. Keaton's daughter, Dexter Keaton White, confirmed her death to Sky's US partner network NBC News. With a long career, across a series of movies that are regarded as some of the best ever made, Keaton was widely admired. She was awarded an Oscar, a BAFTA and two Golden Globe Awards, and was also nominated for two Emmys, and a Tony, as well as picking up a series of other Academy Award and BAFTA nominations. Her best actress Oscar was for the Woody Allen film Annie Hall which is said to be loosely based on her life. She appeared in several other Allen projects, including Manhattan, as well as all three Godfather movies, in which she played Kay, the wife and then ex-wife of Marlon Brando's son Michael Corleone, played by Al Pacino, opposite him as he descends into a life of crime and replaces his father in the family's mafia empire. Keaton was the kind of actor who helped make films iconic and timeless, from her heartbreaking turn as Kay Adams-Corleone to the \"La-dee-da, la-dee-da\" phrasing as Annie Hall, bedecked in the now famous necktie, bowler hat, vest and khakis. \n                  Tom Hollander on AI actor Tilly Norwood : 'Perhaps I'm not scared enough'\n                 \n                  I Swear: The film fighting back against abuse and 'cheap laughs' at Tourette's expense\n                 \n                  Gregg Wallace suing the BBC for 'distress and harassment' following sacking\n                 Keaton also frequently worked with Nancy Meyers, starting with 1987's Baby Boom. Their other films together included 1991's Father Of The Bride and its 1995 sequel, as well as 2003's Something's Gotta Give. In 1996, she starred opposite Goldie Hawn and Bette Midler in The First Wives Club, about three women whose husbands had left them for younger women. More recently, she collaborated with Jane Fonda, Mary Steenburgen and Candice Bergen on the Book Club films. 'Brilliant, beautiful' The unexpected news was met with shock around the world. Her First Wives Club co-star Midler wrote on Instagram: \"The brilliant, beautiful, extraordinary Diane Keaton has died. I cannot tell you how unbearably sad this makes me. \"She was hilarious, a complete original, and completely without guile, or any of the competitiveness one would have expected from such a star. What you saw was who she was ... oh, la, lala!\" Actor Ben Stiller paid tribute on X, writing: \"Diane Keaton. One of the greatest film actors ever. An icon of style, humor and comedy. Brilliant. What a person.\" Kate Hudson, whose mother is Goldie Hawn, posted simply: \"We love you so much Diane.\" In her Instagram tribute, Emmy, Grammy, Oscar, and Tony award-winning actress and producer Viola Davis said: \"No!! No!!! No!! God, not yet, NO!!! Man… you defined womanhood. \"The pathos, humor, levity, your ever-present youthfulness and vulnerability - you tattooed your SOUL into every role, making it impossible to imagine anyone else inhabiting them. \"You were undeniably, unapologetically YOU!!! Loved you. Man… rest well. God bless your family, and I know angels are flying you home.\" Keaton never married. She adopted her daughter Dexter in 1996 and a son, Duke, four years later."

        "Content": "\n          Middle East correspondent\n              @adamparsons\n  Drones have been a common sight in Gaza for a long time, but they have always been military.  The whine of a drone is enough to trigger fear in many within the enclave. But now, drones are delivering something different - long, lingering footage of the devastation that has been wreaked on Gaza. And the images are quite staggering. Gaza latest: Chants of 'thank you Trump' in Hostages Square Whole city blocks reduced to rubble. Streets destroyed. Towns where the landscape has been wholly redesigned. Decapitated tower blocks and whole areas turned into black and white photographs, where there is no colour but only a palette of greys - from the dark hues of scorched walls to the lightest grey of the dust that floats through the air. And everywhere, the indistinct dull grey of rubble - the debris of things that are no longer there. \n                  My interview with a Hamas leader was a glimpse into the unpredictable and frankly unbelievable world of global politics right now\n                 \n                  Gaza latest: Chants of 'thank you Trump' as Witkoff tells Hostages Square 'miracles can happen'\n                 \n                  Will the ceasefire between Israel and Hamas last?\n                 The joy that met the ceasefire has now changed into degrees of anxiety and shock. Gaza is full of people who are returning to their homes and hoping for good news. For a lucky few, fortune is kind, but for most, the news is bad. Umm Firas has been displaced from her home in Khan Younis for the past five months. She returned today to the district she knew so well. And what she found was nothing. \"This morning we returned to our land, to see our homes, the neighbourhoods where we once lived,\" she says. \"But we found no trace of any houses, no streets, no neighbourhoods, no trees. Even the crops, even the trees - all of them had been bulldozed. The entire area has been destroyed. \"There used to be more than 1,750 houses in the block where we lived, but now not a single one remains standing. Every neighbourhood is destroyed, every home is destroyed, every school is destroyed, every tree is destroyed. The area is unliveable. \"There's no infrastructure, no place where we can even set up a tent to sit in. Our area, in downtown Khan Younis used to be densely populated. Our homes were built right next to each other. Now there is literally nowhere to go. \"Where can we go? We can't even find an empty spot to pitch our tent over the ruins of our own homes. So we are going to have to stay homeless and displaced.\" Read more from Sky News:Nova festival survivor dies two years after girlfriend killedCould the Gaza deal lead to something even bigger?It is a story that comes up again and again. One man says that he cannot even reach his house because it is still too near the Israeli military officers stationed in the area. Another, an older man whose bright pink glasses obscure weary eyes, says there is \"nothing left\" of his home \"so we are leaving it to God\". \"I'm glad we survived and are in good health,\" he says, \"and now we can return there even if it means we need to eat sand!\" The bulldozers have already started work across the strip, trying to clear roads and allow access. Debris is being piled into huge piles, but this is a tiny sticking plaster on a huge wound. The more you see of Gaza, the more impossible the task seems of rebuilding this place. The devastation is so utterly overwhelming. Bodies are being found in the rubble while towns are full of buildings that have been so badly damaged they will have to be pulled down. Humanitarian aid is needed urgently, but, for the moment, the entry points remain closed. Charities are pleading for access. It is, of course, better for people to live without war than with it. Peace in Gaza gifts the ability to sleep a little better and worry a little less. But when people do wake up, what they see is an apocalyptic landscape of catastrophic destruction."

Watkins, 48, was serving a 29-year jail term for multiple sexual offences, including serious crimes against young children and babies at HMP Wakefield, in West Yorkshire. He was attacked with a knife by another inmate on Saturday morning, sources have confirmed. West Yorkshire Police said two men, aged 25 and 43, have been arrested on suspicion of murder.

Having found fame in Welsh rock band Lostprophets, Watkins was arrested after his Pontypridd home was searched on orders of a drug warrant in September 2012. A large number of computers, mobile phones and storage devices were seized during the search. When sentenced at Cardiff Crown Court, the singer was told he was being given an extended sentence - and a judge said his crimes \"plumbed new depths of depravity\". After being caught with a mobile phone behind bars in 2019, he told a court that he was locked up with \"murderers, mass murderers, rapists, paedophiles, serial killers - the worst of the worst\"."

        "Content": "\n          Ireland correspondent\n              @SMurphyTV\n  An Irish start-up is hoping to have the UK's first food drone delivery pilot scheme operating in 2026, subject to regulatory approval. With a fleet of specially designed 23kg quadcopters, Manna Aero has carried out more than 200,000 food delivery flights in west Dublin, Espoo in Finland and Texas. As the company aims to expand, its CEO Bobby Healy said the UK \"would be our most important market in Europe. It's by far the biggest delivery market today. We think our product maps really well onto the UK high street, particularly\". \"We're actively in dialogue with both the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) and with NATS (National Air Traffic Services), the airspace manager for the country. And we expect to be there next year,\" Mr Healy added. Manna has completed up to 50,000 deliveries in the D15 postcode of west Dublin since its trial started a year and a half ago. The drones, which are almost fully autonomous, dart overhead at a cruising altitude of 262ft (80m), carrying everything from burgers and chips to fresh meat from a local butcher's shop. Coffee is the most popular order, Mr Healy said, but \"we were really surprised that we deliver a lot of fresh eggs. I think people are trying to deliberately test us to see if we can deliver something as delicate as eggs, but it's not a problem\". \n                  Sir Keir Starmer hails new British 'StormShroud' drones coming into operation\n                 \n                  Coronavirus: Drones to deliver COVID-19 tests and PPE to Isle of Mull\n                 \n                  Passenger plane in near miss with drone over Birmingham primary school \n                 Customers must ensure a landing zone - usually a back garden - is clear of obstacles. This is checked by a human drone operator using a downward-facing camera, before the food is released. The packages descend on a biodegradable string, which is then severed. \"The average flight time is about three minutes. The advantage is that it's quieter, it's safer, it's greener, and it's better for business generally than the road-based alternative.\" But not everyone in the suburbs of west Dublin is so enthused about their new service. Mark Hammond, from Blanchardstown, said the noise the drones make \"is very stressful, absolutely it is. When it's constant, you can't relax. This is across the estate, it's not just me and [wife] Florence, there's a lot of concern about it\". As the fourth quadcopter in an hour flew over their back garden, Florence said they \"sound like helicopters\". Another resident, Michael Dooley, is part of Drone Action Dublin 15. He described the noise of the drone flights as \"very, very bothersome. The drone, when it flies, has a very tonal, sharp, pulsing, intrusive noise. You'll hear it coming from afar\". When hovering at their lowest height, to release their cargo, Michael said the sound \"is intolerable\". Pointing to a study from Trinity College that found relatively low decibel levels, Mr Healy said: \"We know from the science that we're far less noisy than just general background urban noise. And we're continually investing. We have new technology coming in, and propulsion and propellers. \"So I don't think noise is the issue; I think perception is, like any new technology. We had this problem with cars, with steam engines, we had it with every disruptive technology - AI, 5G, you name it. There's a natural concern to be understood. And I think over time it will be generally accepted.\" Read more from Sky News:Nova festival survivor dies two years after girlfriend killedPaedophile Lostprophets singer dies after prison attackPolice try to keep protesters apart at Gaza war demo The Drone Action Dublin 15 group disputes the methodology of the Trinity College study. Local TD [member of parliament] Emer Currie said that with worries about \"a new M50 [motorway] in the sky\", it's a balancing act in the area. \"We do have to be realistic about this. Yes, this is innovation and things are moving forward. But there are realities of the impact on a residential community that have to be taken into consideration. Innovation is important, but so is regulation.\" The Irish government recently brought in a drone policy framework, but critics say actual regulations and legislation remain sorely lacking. Manna acknowledges the EU's regulatory environment is more drone-friendly than in other parts of the world, including the UK and the US. But should negotiations with British regulators prove fruitful, the company is determined to bring its service to UK consumers in 2026. Companies like Amazon have started planning for drone deliveries in the UK. The company is one of six chosen by the Civil Aviation Authority to take part in new trials to expand the use of drones. But Ireland’s regulatory framework is friendlier to drone companies. "

Sixteen people were missing after the huge blast, but Humphreys County Sheriff Chris Davis has now confirmed all died. It happened on Friday morning at Accurate Energetic Systems, a company which supplies and researches explosives for the military. It scattered debris over at least half a mile (800m) and was felt by residents more than 15 miles (24km) away, Mr Davis said. Aerial footage showed the company's hilltop location smouldering and obliterated by smoke for much of Friday, with just a mass of twisted metal, burned-out shells of cars, and an array of debris left behind.

Guy McCormick, a supervisory special agent with the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives said experts need to make the area safe before specialist investigators begin combing through the remains. He said the safety and security of the scene could change quickly because of the heat and pressure caused by the explosion. Signs near the site on Saturday asked for prayers for the families. Terry Bagsby, 68, who works at a petrol station nearby, said people in the close-knit community were \"very, very sad\". \"I don't know how to explain it... Just a lot of grief,\" he added."

Experts say that time spent in nature can reduce stress and anxiety, boost fitness and sleep, and help build resilience.

For many of these children, it's their first proper outdoor garments, and it’s clear from the smiles and muddy boots that it's making a difference. Parents say the impact of outdoor learning is immediate. Julia, a mum at the school, said: \"The fact that they're outdoors, they get the fresh air… he's definitely more buoyant and upbeat when he’s done outdoor learning. \"He sleeps better and that’s a definite plus. When he's been outside, he's not as wired.\" According to research from Natural England, 80% of parents say spending time in nature improves their child's behaviour, while 86% say it boosts their general mood and wellbeing. Holly McKinley, director of communications at WWF, said their research shows that \"70% of primary schools don't have access to nature or don't have access to the outdoors\". Amy Humphries, assistant headteacher at Kingfield Primary School in Woking, says time in nature can make a real difference for children struggling with their mental health. \"Children who have difficulty with mental health definitely appreciate being outside a lot more. It calms them and allows them to move away from the constant technology and noise,\" she said. \"Nature is calmer, quieter, and gives them space to breathe.\" She said many pupils are discovering the world around them for the first time: \"Once they’re comfortable in nature, they absolutely embrace it. \"They're amazed to find blackberries growing on the school grounds or pumpkins in the corner of the playground. It suddenly becomes real and exciting.\" Moses, another parent at the school, said every child deserves access to nature regardless of the weather. \"You learn more from the environment than sitting in a classroom,\" Moses said. \"Kids are so attached to gadgets now and it’s not healthy. It's surprising how much they love playing outdoors if we just give them the opportunity.\" The Waterproofs and Wellies campaign aims to provide outdoor clothing to schools across the UK so that weather, or cost, never stops a child from exploring nature.

        "Content": "By Miriam Kuepper, news reporter  Warning: This article contains details that some people may find disturbing Life was good for Roei Shalev. The 29-year-old had just moved in with the \"love of his life\" a few days before and had been celebrating with her at the Supernova music festival, a rave in Israel's Negev desert. But his joy turned to terror when Hamas gunmen stormed the event near Re'im in the early hours of 7 October 2023. Roei and his girlfriend Mapal Adam were dancing with their friend Hilly Solomon when rocket fire suddenly drowned out the music. Roei, Mapal and Hilly frantically tried to escape by car, driving away from the festival grounds until they encountered a young woman stumbling into the road, covered in blood. She warned them that there were Hamas attackers behind her, so the trio exited their vehicle and ran to nearby trees to hide. \n                  'Terror cannot beat us': Nova festival founders on surviving October 7 - and their hopes for peace\n                 \n                  What does Trump's Gaza peace plan look like?\n                 \n                  Trump's Gaza deal may not go down well with everyone - but for now, it's a beacon of optimism\n                 \"Bullets whizzed past us, grenades exploded nearby, and terror engulfed us from all directions,\" Roei said, recalling the event when writing about it later. They dived under two abandoned cars - Roei and Mapal under one, Hilly under the other. Mapal frantically messaged her sister Maayan, an Israeli TV presenter, who desperately tried to reassure her - and told her help was on the way. But the gunmen caught up with them, shooting the three festivalgoers as they were pinned under the cars. Roei tried to shield 26-year-old Mapal from the bullets, but she died beneath him while he was shot in the back. Hilly, 26, was also killed instantly. What followed were \"agonising\" hours during which Roei lay still, covered in his and his girlfriend's blood, and played dead. Even when a second group of gunmen approached and shot at him a second time, hitting him in the back yet again, he did not move. Seven hours later, the Israeli army found Roei alive. Mapal's family later said it brought them comfort to know she \"had died in his arms\". The terror continued A week after his girlfriend and best friend were killed, Roei said his mother Raffaela took her own life because she \"couldn't contain the pain and losses of October 7\", the day on which attacks by Hamas on Israel resulted in a total of over 1,200 people killed and 251 taken hostage. \"In just one week, I lost three of the most important women to me in the world,\" Roei said. \"In the months that followed, I struggled to cope. Flashbacks and anxiety consumed me, and sleep became a distant memory.\" Roei said therapy and the unwavering support of others gave him the strength to share his story publicly. \"I opened up on social media, laying bare the rawest details of my trauma. The response was overwhelming,\" Roei wrote on a fundraising page for Nova festival survivors and their families last year. \"Messages poured in from people who found solace and inspiration in my journey. Their words gave me purpose, a reason to keep fighting.\" He said he was \"uncertain of what the future holds\", but knew that he had to \"honour the memory of the three extraordinary girls who were taken from us too soon\". In the two years that followed these tragic events, Roei renamed the family bakery he had been running with his girlfriend to \"Mapal Cafe\", in tribute to his \"one and only love\" and organised events to commemorate Mapal and Hilly. \"Amidst the pain and sorrow, I hold onto one truth: we will dance again,\" he said in his fundraising post a year ago. On the second anniversary of his girlfriend's death, Roei wrote on Instagram: \"Two years have passed since the most terrible day of my life... and of a whole country. \"The longing for you is only getting bigger, the pain does not pass with time. It is always there, everywhere, all the time. I'm full of pain this year, even more than last year.\" In the post, Roei thanked his girlfriend for \"moments I won't forget, pure love and the best relationship I could ask for\". He also addressed both her and Hilly, saying: \"A huge apology that I couldn't keep you safe on this terrible day, you know I did everything, I did everything to keep you safe, my beloved. \"I preferred to die in agony and for you to survive it.\" On Friday night, three days after that anniversary, Roei posted a note on his Instagram account, saying he \"can't go on anymore\". \"I've never felt such deep and burning pain and suffering in my life. It's eating me up inside,\" Roei wrote. His note raised concern among his family and friends, and a frantic search was launched. The search ended a few hours later in the tragic discovery of Roei's body inside a burning car near Poleg Beach in Netanya, Israel.

I hope these two children are embraced and smiling now, hearts pressed together again.\" Roei's family confirmed his death in a statement and asked for their privacy to be respected. Police have opened an investigation, according to Israeli media. Anyone feeling emotionally distressed or suicidal can call Samaritans for help on 116 123 or email jo@samaritans.org in the UK.

        "Content": "At least 53 people, including 14 children and 15 women, have been killed in an attack on a displacement shelter in a besieged city in North Darfur. The Sudan Doctors' Network said Sudanese paramilitaries were behind the shelling attack, which also wounded another 21 people, including five more children. The strike by the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) hit the al Arqam Home, which shelters displaced families in Al Fashir, the capital of North Darfur province, the group said. The attack, late on Friday, was the latest deadly onslaught on Al Fashir, which has been for months the epicentre of the war between the Sudanese military and the paramilitaries. A spokesperson for the doctors' network - a group of medical professionals tracking the Sudanese civil war - described the attack as a \"massacre\". A statement said: \"This massacre represents a continuation of the scorched-earth policy practised by the Rapid Support Forces against civilians, in flagrant violation of all international norms and laws.\" Al Fashir is being targeted by the RSF as it pushes to claim full control of the Darfur region as a base for its parallel government, after the military recaptured the capital Khartoum and other key sites in central Sudan. \n                  Sudan's Janjaweed militia leader Ali Muhammad Ali Abd-al-Rahman convicted of war crimes in Darfur\n                 \n                  UAE is 'main backer' behind Sudan war, intelligence officer tells Sky News\n                 \n                  Deaths from mosque attack in besieged Sudanese city 'include at least 11 children'\n                 Close to a million people are facing famine in Al Fashir and surrounding camps, as the RSF enforces a full blockade, launching armed attacks on volunteers and aid workers risking their lives to bring in food. Inside the city, thousands are bombarded by almost daily shelling from surrounding RSF troops. The RSF has physically reinforced its siege with a berm - a raised earth mound. First spotted by Yale Humanitarian Research Lab, the berm is visible from space. The city, the Sudanese military's last stronghold in Darfur, has been under siege for more than a year.

Sudan plunged into chaos when simmering tensions between the military and the RSF exploded into open fighting in April 2023 in Khartoum and elsewhere. The fighting has turned into a full-fledged civil war that has killed tens of thousands of people, displaced more than 14 million people from their homes and pushed parts of the country into famine. The devastating conflict has been marked by atrocities, including mass killings and rape, which the International Criminal Court is investigating as war crimes and crimes against humanity."

Watkins, 48, was serving a 29-year jail term for multiple sexual offences, including serious crimes against young children and babies at HMP Wakefield, in West Yorkshire.

A large number of computers, mobile phones and storage devices were seized during the search.

But for some, it's not just the rain that's keeping them indoors, it's poverty. Experts say that time spent in nature can reduce stress and anxiety, boost fitness and sleep, and help build resilience.

Quaker, 15, was one of five horses from the Life Guards Squadron spooked by rubble being dropped down a chute next to them while on an exercise in Belgravia in April last year. Four service personnel were thrown from their horses, and the animals that ran loose smashed into vehicles, smashing into a taxi and the windscreen of a parked double-decker tour bus. Paramedics treated four people in three separate incidents in Buckingham Palace Road, Belgrave Square, and at the junction of Chancery Lane and Fleet Street, in the space of just 10 minutes. City of London Police managed to capture the horses after nearly half an hour in Limehouse after bolting from Wilton Crescent.

There is now peace on the horizon, but the protestors on both sides believe there’s lots left to fight for. Nearly 500 people were arrested at last week's protest in the capital, most of them on suspicion of supporting the banned terror organisation Palestine Action. It came despite calls for restraint following the deadly terror attack on a Manchester synagogue by a man who pledged allegiance to Islamic State.  Today's protest was the 32nd since the war began in October 2023 - something Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood said had caused \"considerable fear\" for the Jewish community. Plans for greater powers to restrict repeat demonstrations have recently been unveiled by the government. However, Ben Jamal, director of Palestine Solidarity Campaign, insisted the group won't stop organising the marches. \"Israel is capable of breaking the ceasefire at any time, as it has done on every previous occasion,\" he said. \"And we know this ceasefire based on Trump's plan does nothing to address the root causes of Israeli occupation and colonisation of Palestine, and its system of apartheid against Palestinians. \"It also does nothing to hold those responsible for genocide to account.\" Israel has repeatedly denied claims of genocide.

The remaining 20 still alive are set to be released on Monday, in exchange for Palestinian prisoners, after Israel pulled its troops back. However, it is only the first part of Donald Trump's 20-point plan and issues such as the disarming of Hamas and how Gaza will be run are likely to be very difficult to resolve."

        "Content": "\n          Political correspondent\n              @serenabarksing\n  For decades he was the dissident backbencher, then unlikely Labour leader. She was a firebrand left-wing Labour MP with a huge online presence. To the left - on paper - it looked like the perfect combination. Coupled with the support of four other independent MPs, it held the blueprints of a credible party. But ever since the launch of Your Party (working title) the left-wing movement has faced mockery and exasperation over its inability to look organised. First, we learned Jeremy Corbyn's team had been unaware of the exact timing of Zarah Sultana's announcement that she would quit the Labour Party. Then a much bigger row emerged when she launched a membership drive linking people to sign up to the party without the full consent of the team. It laid bare the holes in the structure of the party and pulled focus away from its core values of trying to be a party to counter Labour and Reform UK, while also drawing out some pretty robust language from their only woman MP calling the grouping a \"sexist boys club\". It gave the impression that she was being sidelined by the four other male MPs behind the scenes. This week, they tried to come together for the first time at a rally I attended in Liverpool and then, in quick succession, another event at The World Transformed conference the day after. But not everyone I spoke to who turned up to see the two heroes of the left found them all that convincing. Jeremy Corbyn admitted to me that \"there were some errors made about announcements and that caused a problem\". He said he was disappointed but that \"we're past that\". Zarah Sultana said they were like Liam and Noel, who managed to \"patch things up and have a very successful tour - we are doing the same\". The problem is, it didn't really explain what happened, or how they resolved things behind the scenes, and for some, it might have done too much damage already. Layla signed up as a member when she first saw the link. It was the moment she had been waiting for after becoming frustrated with Labour. But she told me she found the ordeal \"very unprofessional, very dishonest and messy\", and said she doesn't want to be in a disorganised party and has lost trust in where her money will end up. She's now thinking about the Greens. She said their leader, Zack Polanski \"seemed like such a strong politician\" with \"a lot of charisma\".  Since Polanski's rise to power as leader, the Green Party has surged in popularity. According to a recent poll, they went up four points in just one week (following their conference). Voters, particularly on the left, seem to like his brand of \"eco populism\". While he has politely declined formally working in conjunction with Your Party publicly, he has said the \"door is always open\" to collaboration especially as he sees common goals between the two parties. Zarah Sultana said this weekend though that the Greens don't describe themselves as socialists and that they support NATO which she has dubbed an \"imperialist war machine\". While newer coalitions may not be the problem for now, internal fissures might come sooner than they expect. Voters at the rally this weekend came with pretty clear concerns about some of the other independent MPs involved in Your Party.

A question that would solicit a simple answer in a crowd like this. But he said his view was very simple, that he is interested in fighting for equality, fairness and justice: 'We all know that different wards, different constituencies have different priorities and MPs should be allowed to represent the views of the communities they serve.\" To him, that can sometimes mean voting against the private school tax and against decriminalising abortion. The Your Party rally on Thursday night was packed, but the tone was subdued. People came full of optimism but they also wanted to make up their mind about the credibility of the new offering and to see the renewed reconciliation up close. The organisers closed the evening off with John Lennon's song, Imagine. That was apt, because until the party can get their act together, that's all they'll be doing."

        "Content": " Calls for a meeting with Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer have been snubbed by No 10,  the leader of Plaid Cymru has told Sky News. Rhun ap Iorwerth, who has served as leader of the Welsh nationalist party since June 2023, is looking likely to become Wales's first minister next May, but when he asked to meet with Sir Keir after his election last year, he says he was turned down. Speaking with Sky News' political correspondent Liz Bates, Mr ap Iorwerth said he had \"never\" had a conversation with the prime minister but it was \"not because I haven't tried\". He added: \"When I contacted the prime minister to ask for a meeting, after his election last year, I was turned down and it was passed on to the Secretary of State for Wales. \"People can read into that what they want. \"I've spoken very openly about wanting to have a constructive relationship with the UK prime minister.\" The former journalist said in his reporting days he had not interviewed Sir Keir and now, in politics, their \"paths had never crossed\" but he said he felt it was \"important\". \n                  Is Labour losing Wales to Reform? \n                 \n                  Welsh Labour leader backs calls for winter fuel payment cut rethink\n                 \n                  Welsh first minister 'expecting uplift' in money for railways in Wales from Westminster as she slams 'unfair' HS2 funding\n                 \"I have certainly asked if we could meet. And that is certainly something that I would still love to happen,\" he said. Mr ap Iorwerth said a conversation would be key because if he became Welsh first minister, there would be \"serious negotiations on serious issues around funding for Wales - on investing in infrastructure in Wales, on the future of how we're able to influence and use our natural resources in Wales\". \"So I want to have that constructive relationship,\" he said. In an apparent nod to current Labour first minister Eluned Morgan, Mr ap Iorwerth said Sir Keir would be in \"no doubt\" that his loyalty \"would always be to the people of Wales\". He said: \"I won't be pulling my punches in order to save the Labour Party embarrassment. \"I'll be really laying out what's in the interest of Wales. And that's, I think, a fundamentally different relationship. But it has to be, and I want it to be, a constructive one.\" The next Senedd election is May 2026, when voters in Wales will elect 96 members for the first time - an increase of more than 50% from the current 60. Welsh politics has traditionally been dominated by Labour. Labour's grip on Wales sliding? Welsh Labour MPs have been the largest group sent to Westminster in every general election since 1922 - and the party has been in government in the country for more than a quarter of a century. But if the polls are accurate, Labour's long-standing grip on politics in Wales is fading. Plaid Cymru and Reform UK are running almost neck and neck, while Labour trails significantly."

        "Content": "\n          Political correspondent\n              @wizbates\n Politics has always been unforgiving, but never more so than now. So, speaking to the man who is on the brink of power in Wales, raises the question of whether he is really ready for what's he's taking on. Plaid Cymru leader Rhun ap Iorwerth is a former journalist so he knows how to present himself, but much bigger challenges are coming, and fast. At next May's Senedd elections, he is narrowly on course to become first minister, according to current polls. But before that he faces the same battle as leaders across the UK - how to beat Reform, who are running his party very close. It's not clear he has a different strategy to any other politician, as he condemns their politics as divisive and tries instead to present a positive vision of unity and more public spending. Maybe he has a better chance than most though as he can at least point the finger of blame firmly elsewhere - Westminster. \n                  Plaid Cymru leader was 'turned down' for meeting with PM, he claims\n                 \n                  'The time is now to stop Reform' - Plaid Cymru calls on Labour voters to unite behind Welsh nationalists \n                 \n                  Video shows surfer being rescued by RNLI after powerful rip current dragged him out to sea\n                 That leads to his second big problem of how to get anything from a Labour prime minister when you lead an opposition party. In his conference speech he criticised Welsh Labour leader Eluned Morgan for being unable to influence Sir Keir Starmer. But Mr ap Iorwerth later revealed to Sky News that he's never even spoken to the prime minister, and when a meeting was requested he was offered the Secretary of State for Wales instead. If he does become first minister he will have to walk the difficult line of fostering a privately productive relationship while still criticising in public. Looming over all of this is the question of Welsh independence.

Mr ap Iorwerth says it's because they need to lay the groundwork, have a consultation on the process and bring the public with them. The truth is that the Welsh economy is so reliant on the rest of the UK that separation would be difficult, to say the least. Figuring out how to keep pursuing their core purpose while acknowledging that reality could become corrosive. Having said all that, he has a sense of momentum and purpose that many other politicians are lacking, driven by a strong sense of Welsh identity. If he does get over the line in May, it will be this feeling that propels him, and he will need to draw on it again and again as he faces the tough times ahead."

        "Content": "\n          Middle East correspondent\n              @adamparsons\n  Drones have been a common sight in Gaza for a long time, but they have always been military.  The whine of a drone is enough to trigger fear in many within the enclave. But now, drones are delivering something different - long, lingering footage of the devastation that has been wreaked on Gaza. And the images are quite staggering. Gaza latest: Chants of 'thank you Trump' in Hostages Square Whole city blocks reduced to rubble. Streets destroyed. Towns where the landscape has been wholly redesigned. Decapitated tower blocks and whole areas turned into black and white photographs, where there is no colour but only a palette of greys - from the dark hues of scorched walls to the lightest grey of the dust that floats through the air. And everywhere, the indistinct dull grey of rubble - the debris of things that are no longer there. \n                  My interview with a Hamas leader was a glimpse into the unpredictable and frankly unbelievable world of global politics right now\n                 \n                  Gaza latest: Chants of 'thank you Trump' as Witkoff tells Hostages Square 'miracles can happen'\n                 \n                  Will the ceasefire between Israel and Hamas last?\n                 The joy that met the ceasefire has now changed into degrees of anxiety and shock. Gaza is full of people who are returning to their homes and hoping for good news. For a lucky few, fortune is kind, but for most, the news is bad. Umm Firas has been displaced from her home in Khan Younis for the past five months. She returned today to the district she knew so well. And what she found was nothing. \"This morning we returned to our land, to see our homes, the neighbourhoods where we once lived,\" she says. \"But we found no trace of any houses, no streets, no neighbourhoods, no trees. Even the crops, even the trees - all of them had been bulldozed. The entire area has been destroyed. \"There used to be more than 1,750 houses in the block where we lived, but now not a single one remains standing. Every neighbourhood is destroyed, every home is destroyed, every school is destroyed, every tree is destroyed. The area is unliveable. \"There's no infrastructure, no place where we can even set up a tent to sit in. Our area, in downtown Khan Younis used to be densely populated. Our homes were built right next to each other. Now there is literally nowhere to go. \"Where can we go? We can't even find an empty spot to pitch our tent over the ruins of our own homes. So we are going to have to stay homeless and displaced.\" Read more from Sky News:Nova festival survivor dies two years after girlfriend killedCould the Gaza deal lead to something even bigger?It is a story that comes up again and again. One man says that he cannot even reach his house because it is still too near the Israeli military officers stationed in the area. Another, an older man whose bright pink glasses obscure weary eyes, says there is \"nothing left\" of his home \"so we are leaving it to God\". \"I'm glad we survived and are in good health,\" he says, \"and now we can return there even if it means we need to eat sand!\" The bulldozers have already started work across the strip, trying to clear roads and allow access. Debris is being piled into huge piles, but this is a tiny sticking plaster on a huge wound. The more you see of Gaza, the more impossible the task seems of rebuilding this place. The devastation is so utterly overwhelming. Bodies are being found in the rubble while towns are full of buildings that have been so badly damaged they will have to be pulled down. Humanitarian aid is needed urgently, but, for the moment, the entry points remain closed. Charities are pleading for access. It is, of course, better for people to live without war than with it. Peace in Gaza gifts the ability to sleep a little better and worry a little less. But when people do wake up, what they see is an apocalyptic landscape of catastrophic destruction."

And yet, in an exclusive interview with Hamas's senior leader Dr Basem Naim, that's exactly what happened. \"Without the personal interference of President Trump in this case, I don't think that it would happen to reach this end, the end of the war,\" Dr Naim told me. \"Therefore, yes, we thank President Trump and his personal efforts to interfere and to pressure Israel to make an end of this massacre and slaughtering.\" He was speaking from his office in Doha, where last month he and a group of Hamas leaders, meeting to discuss Trump's plan, were targeted in an Israeli air strike.

Let's be clear: Hamas is under serious pressure. It is facing calls to step away from governing Gaza and disarming altogether, not just from Israel and the US but regional powers as well.  Gaza needs an enormous amount of aid, investment and reconstruction. A humanitarian catastrophe which has killed 67,000 Gazans, destroyed or damaged 90% of people's homes and forced 1.2 million people to become displaced. The message from major international powers is that their long-term commitment will require a new ruling force in the strip. Dr Naim told me the organisation was willing to cede political control but rejected calls to lay down their arms until a comprehensive agreement was reached.  \"We are ready to hand over government, we are ready to be totally away from any government or government body but when it comes to Hamas as an entity, as a Palestinian liberation movement, I think no one can overcome or exclude Hamas,\" he said. \"Our weapons are only going to be handed over only to the hands of a Palestinian state and our fighters will be integrated into a Palestinian national army. \"Before that, no one has the right to deny us the right to resist the occupation by all means.\" Read more:All the hostages believed to be alive and who are due for releaseCould the Gaza deal lead to something even bigger? The negotiators of Wednesday's deal in the Egyptian resort of Sharm el-Sheikh may choose to ignore those comments for the time being. There is, after all, undeniable relief that the fighting has finally stopped, the hostages will be released and 2 million Gazans can sleep safely without the fear of Israeli bombardment. But for the next phase of this deal to be realised, it will need clear answers as to who runs Gaza? Donald Trump and his team believe former British prime minister Sir Tony Blair will have some role to play, something the Hamas official was quick to dismiss. \"To be honest, when I hear the name Tony Blair, I can see this could be Balfour Declaration 2… I think all Palestinians, not only in Hamas, not only in Gaza, have very bad, and very negative image of him. \"And I do not believe that he will be very welcome.\" There will be many who read his comments as proof the organisation has no intention of relinquishing control of Gaza. Hamas itself may feel some sense of achievement that it was the only representative of the Palestinian political factions involved in the negotiations earlier this week. But the key question now is, who will be responsible for the governance of Gaza and the daunting security challenges that millions are facing."

But his joy turned to terror when Hamas gunmen stormed the event near Re'im in the early hours of 7 October 2023. Roei and his girlfriend Mapal Adam were dancing with their friend Hilly Solomon when rocket fire suddenly drowned out the music.

But the gunmen caught up with them, shooting the three festivalgoers as they were pinned under the cars. Roei tried to shield 26-year-old Mapal from the bullets, but she died beneath him while he was shot in the back. Hilly, 26, was also killed instantly. What followed were \"agonising\" hours during which Roei lay still, covered in his and his girlfriend's blood, and played dead. Even when a second group of gunmen approached and shot at him a second time, hitting him in the back yet again, he did not move. Seven hours later, the Israeli army found Roei alive. Mapal's family later said it brought them comfort to know she \"had died in his arms\". The terror continued A week after his girlfriend and best friend were killed, Roei said his mother Raffaela took her own life because she \"couldn't contain the pain and losses of October 7\", the day on which attacks by Hamas on Israel resulted in a total of over 1,200 people killed and 251 taken hostage. \"In just one week, I lost three of the most important women to me in the world,\" Roei said. \"In the months that followed, I struggled to cope. Flashbacks and anxiety consumed me, and sleep became a distant memory.\" Roei said therapy and the unwavering support of others gave him the strength to share his story publicly. \"I opened up on social media, laying bare the rawest details of my trauma. The response was overwhelming,\" Roei wrote on a fundraising page for Nova festival survivors and their families last year. \"Messages poured in from people who found solace and inspiration in my journey. Their words gave me purpose, a reason to keep fighting.\" He said he was \"uncertain of what the future holds\", but knew that he had to \"honour the memory of the three extraordinary girls who were taken from us too soon\". In the two years that followed these tragic events, Roei renamed the family bakery he had been running with his girlfriend to \"Mapal Cafe\", in tribute to his \"one and only love\" and organised events to commemorate Mapal and Hilly. \"Amidst the pain and sorrow, I hold onto one truth: we will dance again,\" he said in his fundraising post a year ago. On the second anniversary of his girlfriend's death, Roei wrote on Instagram: \"Two years have passed since the most terrible day of my life... and of a whole country. \"The longing for you is only getting bigger, the pain does not pass with time. It is always there, everywhere, all the time. I'm full of pain this year, even more than last year.\" In the post, Roei thanked his girlfriend for \"moments I won't forget, pure love and the best relationship I could ask for\". He also addressed both her and Hilly, saying: \"A huge apology that I couldn't keep you safe on this terrible day, you know I did everything, I did everything to keep you safe, my beloved. \"I preferred to die in agony and for you to survive it.\" On Friday night, three days after that anniversary, Roei posted a note on his Instagram account, saying he \"can't go on anymore\". \"I've never felt such deep and burning pain and suffering in my life. It's eating me up inside,\" Roei wrote. His note raised concern among his family and friends, and a frantic search was launched. The search ended a few hours later in the tragic discovery of Roei's body inside a burning car near Poleg Beach in Netanya, Israel.

        "Content": "\n          Ireland correspondent\n              @SMurphyTV\n  An Irish start-up is hoping to have the UK's first food drone delivery pilot scheme operating in 2026, subject to regulatory approval. With a fleet of specially designed 23kg quadcopters, Manna Aero has carried out more than 200,000 food delivery flights in west Dublin, Espoo in Finland and Texas. As the company aims to expand, its CEO Bobby Healy said the UK \"would be our most important market in Europe. It's by far the biggest delivery market today. We think our product maps really well onto the UK high street, particularly\". \"We're actively in dialogue with both the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) and with NATS (National Air Traffic Services), the airspace manager for the country. And we expect to be there next year,\" Mr Healy added. Manna has completed up to 50,000 deliveries in the D15 postcode of west Dublin since its trial started a year and a half ago. The drones, which are almost fully autonomous, dart overhead at a cruising altitude of 262ft (80m), carrying everything from burgers and chips to fresh meat from a local butcher's shop. Coffee is the most popular order, Mr Healy said, but \"we were really surprised that we deliver a lot of fresh eggs. I think people are trying to deliberately test us to see if we can deliver something as delicate as eggs, but it's not a problem\". \n                  Sir Keir Starmer hails new British 'StormShroud' drones coming into operation\n                 \n                  Coronavirus: Drones to deliver COVID-19 tests and PPE to Isle of Mull\n                 \n                  Passenger plane in near miss with drone over Birmingham primary school \n                 Customers must ensure a landing zone - usually a back garden - is clear of obstacles. This is checked by a human drone operator using a downward-facing camera, before the food is released. The packages descend on a biodegradable string, which is then severed. \"The average flight time is about three minutes. The advantage is that it's quieter, it's safer, it's greener, and it's better for business generally than the road-based alternative.\" But not everyone in the suburbs of west Dublin is so enthused about their new service. Mark Hammond, from Blanchardstown, said the noise the drones make \"is very stressful, absolutely it is. When it's constant, you can't relax. This is across the estate, it's not just me and [wife] Florence, there's a lot of concern about it\". As the fourth quadcopter in an hour flew over their back garden, Florence said they \"sound like helicopters\". Another resident, Michael Dooley, is part of Drone Action Dublin 15. He described the noise of the drone flights as \"very, very bothersome. The drone, when it flies, has a very tonal, sharp, pulsing, intrusive noise. You'll hear it coming from afar\". When hovering at their lowest height, to release their cargo, Michael said the sound \"is intolerable\". Pointing to a study from Trinity College that found relatively low decibel levels, Mr Healy said: \"We know from the science that we're far less noisy than just general background urban noise. And we're continually investing. We have new technology coming in, and propulsion and propellers. \"So I don't think noise is the issue; I think perception is, like any new technology. We had this problem with cars, with steam engines, we had it with every disruptive technology - AI, 5G, you name it. There's a natural concern to be understood. And I think over time it will be generally accepted.\" Read more from Sky News:Nova festival survivor dies two years after girlfriend killedPaedophile Lostprophets singer dies after prison attackPolice try to keep protesters apart at Gaza war demo The Drone Action Dublin 15 group disputes the methodology of the Trinity College study. Local TD [member of parliament] Emer Currie said that with worries about \"a new M50 [motorway] in the sky\", it's a balancing act in the area. \"We do have to be realistic about this. Yes, this is innovation and things are moving forward. But there are realities of the impact on a residential community that have to be taken into consideration. Innovation is important, but so is regulation.\" The Irish government recently brought in a drone policy framework, but critics say actual regulations and legislation remain sorely lacking. Manna acknowledges the EU's regulatory environment is more drone-friendly than in other parts of the world, including the UK and the US. But should negotiations with British regulators prove fruitful, the company is determined to bring its service to UK consumers in 2026. Companies like Amazon have started planning for drone deliveries in the UK. The company is one of six chosen by the Civil Aviation Authority to take part in new trials to expand the use of drones. But Ireland’s regulatory framework is friendlier to drone companies. "

        "Content": "At least 53 people, including 14 children and 15 women, have been killed in an attack on a displacement shelter in a besieged city in North Darfur. The Sudan Doctors' Network said Sudanese paramilitaries were behind the shelling attack, which also wounded another 21 people, including five more children. The strike by the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) hit the al Arqam Home, which shelters displaced families in Al Fashir, the capital of North Darfur province, the group said. The attack, late on Friday, was the latest deadly onslaught on Al Fashir, which has been for months the epicentre of the war between the Sudanese military and the paramilitaries. A spokesperson for the doctors' network - a group of medical professionals tracking the Sudanese civil war - described the attack as a \"massacre\". A statement said: \"This massacre represents a continuation of the scorched-earth policy practised by the Rapid Support Forces against civilians, in flagrant violation of all international norms and laws.\" Al Fashir is being targeted by the RSF as it pushes to claim full control of the Darfur region as a base for its parallel government, after the military recaptured the capital Khartoum and other key sites in central Sudan. \n                  Sudan's Janjaweed militia leader Ali Muhammad Ali Abd-al-Rahman convicted of war crimes in Darfur\n                 \n                  UAE is 'main backer' behind Sudan war, intelligence officer tells Sky News\n                 \n                  Deaths from mosque attack in besieged Sudanese city 'include at least 11 children'\n                 Close to a million people are facing famine in Al Fashir and surrounding camps, as the RSF enforces a full blockade, launching armed attacks on volunteers and aid workers risking their lives to bring in food. Inside the city, thousands are bombarded by almost daily shelling from surrounding RSF troops. The RSF has physically reinforced its siege with a berm - a raised earth mound. First spotted by Yale Humanitarian Research Lab, the berm is visible from space. The city, the Sudanese military's last stronghold in Darfur, has been under siege for more than a year.

The fighting has turned into a full-fledged civil war that has killed tens of thousands of people, displaced more than 14 million people from their homes and pushed parts of the country into famine. The devastating conflict has been marked by atrocities, including mass killings and rape, which the International Criminal Court is investigating as war crimes and crimes against humanity."

Keaton's daughter, Dexter Keaton White, confirmed her death to Sky's US partner network NBC News. With a long career, across a series of movies that are regarded as some of the best ever made, Keaton was widely admired. She was awarded an Oscar, a BAFTA and two Golden Globe Awards, and was also nominated for two Emmys, and a Tony, as well as picking up a series of other Academy Award and BAFTA nominations. Her best actress Oscar was for the Woody Allen film Annie Hall which is said to be loosely based on her life. She appeared in several other Allen projects, including Manhattan, as well as all three Godfather movies, in which she played Kay, the wife and then ex-wife of Marlon Brando's son Michael Corleone, played by Al Pacino, opposite him as he descends into a life of crime and replaces his father in the family's mafia empire. Keaton was the kind of actor who helped make films iconic and timeless, from her heartbreaking turn as Kay Adams-Corleone to the \"La-dee-da, la-dee-da\" phrasing as Annie Hall, bedecked in the now famous necktie, bowler hat, vest and khakis. \n                  Tom Hollander on AI actor Tilly Norwood : 'Perhaps I'm not scared enough'\n                 \n                  I Swear: The film fighting back against abuse and 'cheap laughs' at Tourette's expense\n                 \n                  Gregg Wallace suing the BBC for 'distress and harassment' following sacking\n                 Keaton also frequently worked with Nancy Meyers, starting with 1987's Baby Boom.

On 19 September, US President Donald Trump and China's President Xi Jinping spoke on the phone after months of silence. It was only the second conversation confirmed by both sides since President Trump was inaugurated in January. It appeared the relationship between the US and China may be stabilising. In April, US tariffs on China reached 145%. China's tariffs on the US reached 125%. This made trade virtually impossible. But in May, it calmed down, tariffs were reduced, and China's restrictions on exports of rare-earth elements were partially lifted. President Trump gave China 90 days for negotiations, and then extended it. Various rounds of talks were held in Europe. This led to new hope that trade between the world's two largest economies would get back on track, and a deal would be reached. The hope didn't last long. This week, China announced new export controls on global supplies of rare earths and critical minerals. These are essential for producing everything from mobile phones to weapons. Critical minerals have become one of the most powerful tools China can leverage in its trade competition with the US and the rest of the world. It dominates the industry, controlling 90% of the world's rare earth processing and 70% of the supply. President Trump has his own obsession with securing access to these precious minerals. Think of his focus on Canada, Greenland, Ukraine, the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) and Australia. China knows that restricting access to these materials puts pressure on the US. It has been gradually expanding its export controls and restrictions on rare earths for two years. In the other direction, the US has shown its ability to restrict China's access to the most advanced semiconductor technology - the essential computer chips that power smartphones, AI systems, and more. This latest salvo from China caused a quick reaction from President Trump. He's threatening to impose additional 100% tariffs on Chinese imports from 1 November, or \"sooner\".

The US-China relationship is as unstable as ever, and the markets don't know what to think, because it could change on the whim of one man. Mr Trump."

        "Content": "\n          City editor\n              @MarkKleinmanSky\n Legal & General (L&G) is plotting a swoop on the workplace pensions provider owned by NatWest Group, the FTSE-100 lender, as its chief executive seeks to grow its share of the UK retirement market. Sky News has learnt that L&G is among a handful of suitors which have expressed an interest in acquiring Cushon from NatWest. This weekend, City sources said there was \"significant\" competition to buy the business and L&G was not certain to be the eventual buyer. If a deal with L&G does transpire, Cushon would augment a master trust business which manages more than £36.5bn in assets, making it the largest commercial entity of its kind in the UK. The L&G master trust unit serves 349 employers and 1.9 million members. Cushon manages assets worth £3.7bn, according to the latest figures provided by NatWest, which bought a controlling stake in the business for £144m two years ago. The pensions business serves roughly 650,000 members across approximately 21,000 employers. \n                  The 40 jobs 'most at risk of AI' - and 40 it can't touch\n                 \n                  Food delivery drones could soon be roaming British skies\n                 \n                  Trump threatens additional 100% tariff on 'aggressive' China\n                 NatWest owns an 85% stake in Cushon, with the remainder held by the subsidiary's management. For NatWest, a sale would reflect chief Paul Thwaite's determination to refocus the bank - which shed the last vestiges of taxpayer ownership earlier this year - on its core strategic priorities. These include a bank-wide simplification programme and more active balance sheet and risk management. Under Mr Thwaite, NatWest has considered a small number of larger-scale acquisitions, including that of Santander UK. That deal did not progress because of NatWest's determination to pay a price that would be deemed attractive by its shareholders. Cushon offers workplace pension products as well as a range of workplace ISAs, including Junior ISAs, Lifetime ISAs and General Investment Accounts. NatWest's acquisition of the business was aimed at diversifying its non-interest income by offering Cushon's products to the bank's commercial and business banking customers. For Antonio Simoes, the former HSBC and Santander executive who runs L&G, an acquisition of Cushon would bolster its offering in an important strategic area. The government announced major pensions reforms this year aimed at driving greater scale and reducing unnecessary bureaucratic expenses, with a view to defined contribution schemes managing at least £25 billion in assets by 2030. A NatWest Group spokesperson declined to comment on the talks with L&G but had previously said in relation to an auction of Cushon: \"We do not comment on speculation. \"Our focus remains on delivering for our customers.\" The identities of other bidders for Cushon were unclear on Saturday. L&G declined to comment."

        "Content": "\n          Political correspondent\n              @serenabarksing\n  For decades he was the dissident backbencher, then unlikely Labour leader. She was a firebrand left-wing Labour MP with a huge online presence. To the left - on paper - it looked like the perfect combination. Coupled with the support of four other independent MPs, it held the blueprints of a credible party. But ever since the launch of Your Party (working title) the left-wing movement has faced mockery and exasperation over its inability to look organised. First, we learned Jeremy Corbyn's team had been unaware of the exact timing of Zarah Sultana's announcement that she would quit the Labour Party. Then a much bigger row emerged when she launched a membership drive linking people to sign up to the party without the full consent of the team. It laid bare the holes in the structure of the party and pulled focus away from its core values of trying to be a party to counter Labour and Reform UK, while also drawing out some pretty robust language from their only woman MP calling the grouping a \"sexist boys club\". It gave the impression that she was being sidelined by the four other male MPs behind the scenes. This week, they tried to come together for the first time at a rally I attended in Liverpool and then, in quick succession, another event at The World Transformed conference the day after. But not everyone I spoke to who turned up to see the two heroes of the left found them all that convincing. Jeremy Corbyn admitted to me that \"there were some errors made about announcements and that caused a problem\". He said he was disappointed but that \"we're past that\". Zarah Sultana said they were like Liam and Noel, who managed to \"patch things up and have a very successful tour - we are doing the same\". The problem is, it didn't really explain what happened, or how they resolved things behind the scenes, and for some, it might have done too much damage already. Layla signed up as a member when she first saw the link. It was the moment she had been waiting for after becoming frustrated with Labour. But she told me she found the ordeal \"very unprofessional, very dishonest and messy\", and said she doesn't want to be in a disorganised party and has lost trust in where her money will end up. She's now thinking about the Greens. She said their leader, Zack Polanski \"seemed like such a strong politician\" with \"a lot of charisma\".  Since Polanski's rise to power as leader, the Green Party has surged in popularity. According to a recent poll, they went up four points in just one week (following their conference). Voters, particularly on the left, seem to like his brand of \"eco populism\". While he has politely declined formally working in conjunction with Your Party publicly, he has said the \"door is always open\" to collaboration especially as he sees common goals between the two parties. Zarah Sultana said this weekend though that the Greens don't describe themselves as socialists and that they support NATO which she has dubbed an \"imperialist war machine\". While newer coalitions may not be the problem for now, internal fissures might come sooner than they expect. Voters at the rally this weekend came with pretty clear concerns about some of the other independent MPs involved in Your Party. Read more on Sky News:AI 'distorting women online'Pros and cons of digital IDsImpact of new online safety rules I asked Ayoub Khan if he considered himself left-wing. A question that would solicit a simple answer in a crowd like this. But he said his view was very simple, that he is interested in fighting for equality, fairness and justice: 'We all know that different wards, different constituencies have different priorities and MPs should be allowed to represent the views of the communities they serve.\" To him, that can sometimes mean voting against the private school tax and against decriminalising abortion. The Your Party rally on Thursday night was packed, but the tone was subdued. People came full of optimism but they also wanted to make up their mind about the credibility of the new offering and to see the renewed reconciliation up close. The organisers closed the evening off with John Lennon's song, Imagine. That was apt, because until the party can get their act together, that's all they'll be doing."

Rhun ap Iorwerth, who has served as leader of the Welsh nationalist party since June 2023, is looking likely to become Wales's first minister next May, but when he asked to meet with Sir Keir after his election last year, he says he was turned down. Speaking with Sky News' political correspondent Liz Bates, Mr ap Iorwerth said he had \"never\" had a conversation with the prime minister but it was \"not because I haven't tried\". He added: \"When I contacted the prime minister to ask for a meeting, after his election last year, I was turned down and it was passed on to the Secretary of State for Wales. \"People can read into that what they want. \"I've spoken very openly about wanting to have a constructive relationship with the UK prime minister.\" The former journalist said in his reporting days he had not interviewed Sir Keir and now, in politics, their \"paths had never crossed\" but he said he felt it was \"important\". \n                  Is Labour losing Wales to Reform? \n                 \n                  Welsh Labour leader backs calls for winter fuel payment cut rethink\n                 \n                  Welsh first minister 'expecting uplift' in money for railways in Wales from Westminster as she slams 'unfair' HS2 funding\n                 \"I have certainly asked if we could meet. And that is certainly something that I would still love to happen,\" he said. Mr ap Iorwerth said a conversation would be key because if he became Welsh first minister, there would be \"serious negotiations on serious issues around funding for Wales - on investing in infrastructure in Wales, on the future of how we're able to influence and use our natural resources in Wales\". \"So I want to have that constructive relationship,\" he said. In an apparent nod to current Labour first minister Eluned Morgan, Mr ap Iorwerth said Sir Keir would be in \"no doubt\" that his loyalty \"would always be to the people of Wales\". He said: \"I won't be pulling my punches in order to save the Labour Party embarrassment. \"I'll be really laying out what's in the interest of Wales. And that's, I think, a fundamentally different relationship. But it has to be, and I want it to be, a constructive one.\" The next Senedd election is May 2026, when voters in Wales will elect 96 members for the first time - an increase of more than 50% from the current 60. Welsh politics has traditionally been dominated by Labour. Labour's grip on Wales sliding? Welsh Labour MPs have been the largest group sent to Westminster in every general election since 1922 - and the party has been in government in the country for more than a quarter of a century. But if the polls are accurate, Labour's long-standing grip on politics in Wales is fading. Plaid Cymru and Reform UK are running almost neck and neck, while Labour trails significantly."

        "Content": "\n          Political correspondent\n              @wizbates\n Politics has always been unforgiving, but never more so than now. So, speaking to the man who is on the brink of power in Wales, raises the question of whether he is really ready for what's he's taking on. Plaid Cymru leader Rhun ap Iorwerth is a former journalist so he knows how to present himself, but much bigger challenges are coming, and fast. At next May's Senedd elections, he is narrowly on course to become first minister, according to current polls. But before that he faces the same battle as leaders across the UK - how to beat Reform, who are running his party very close. It's not clear he has a different strategy to any other politician, as he condemns their politics as divisive and tries instead to present a positive vision of unity and more public spending. Maybe he has a better chance than most though as he can at least point the finger of blame firmly elsewhere - Westminster. \n                  Plaid Cymru leader was 'turned down' for meeting with PM, he claims\n                 \n                  'The time is now to stop Reform' - Plaid Cymru calls on Labour voters to unite behind Welsh nationalists \n                 \n                  Video shows surfer being rescued by RNLI after powerful rip current dragged him out to sea\n                 That leads to his second big problem of how to get anything from a Labour prime minister when you lead an opposition party. In his conference speech he criticised Welsh Labour leader Eluned Morgan for being unable to influence Sir Keir Starmer. But Mr ap Iorwerth later revealed to Sky News that he's never even spoken to the prime minister, and when a meeting was requested he was offered the Secretary of State for Wales instead. If he does become first minister he will have to walk the difficult line of fostering a privately productive relationship while still criticising in public. Looming over all of this is the question of Welsh independence.

Mr ap Iorwerth says it's because they need to lay the groundwork, have a consultation on the process and bring the public with them. The truth is that the Welsh economy is so reliant on the rest of the UK that separation would be difficult, to say the least. Figuring out how to keep pursuing their core purpose while acknowledging that reality could become corrosive. Having said all that, he has a sense of momentum and purpose that many other politicians are lacking, driven by a strong sense of Welsh identity. If he does get over the line in May, it will be this feeling that propels him, and he will need to draw on it again and again as he faces the tough times ahead."

Keaton's daughter, Dexter Keaton White, confirmed her death to Sky's US partner network NBC News.

She was awarded an Oscar, a BAFTA and two Golden Globe Awards, and was also nominated for two Emmys, and a Tony, as well as picking up a series of other Academy Award and BAFTA nominations. Her best actress Oscar was for the Woody Allen film Annie Hall which is said to be loosely based on her life. She appeared in several other Allen projects, including Manhattan, as well as all three Godfather movies, in which she played Kay, the wife and then ex-wife of Marlon Brando's son Michael Corleone, played by Al Pacino, opposite him as he descends into a life of crime and replaces his father in the family's mafia empire. Keaton was the kind of actor who helped make films iconic and timeless, from her heartbreaking turn as Kay Adams-Corleone to the \"La-dee-da, la-dee-da\" phrasing as Annie Hall, bedecked in the now famous necktie, bowler hat, vest and khakis. \n                  Tom Hollander on AI actor Tilly Norwood : 'Perhaps I'm not scared enough'\n                 \n                  I Swear: The film fighting back against abuse and 'cheap laughs' at Tourette's expense\n                 \n                  Gregg Wallace suing the BBC for 'distress and harassment' following sacking\n                 Keaton also frequently worked with Nancy Meyers, starting with 1987's Baby Boom. Their other films together included 1991's Father Of The Bride and its 1995 sequel, as well as 2003's Something's Gotta Give. In 1996, she starred opposite Goldie Hawn and Bette Midler in The First Wives Club, about three women whose husbands had left them for younger women. More recently, she collaborated with Jane Fonda, Mary Steenburgen and Candice Bergen on the Book Club films. 'Brilliant, beautiful' The unexpected news was met with shock around the world. Her First Wives Club co-star Midler wrote on Instagram: \"The brilliant, beautiful, extraordinary Diane Keaton has died. I cannot tell you how unbearably sad this makes me. \"She was hilarious, a complete original, and completely without guile, or any of the competitiveness one would have expected from such a star. What you saw was who she was ... oh, la, lala!\" Actor Ben Stiller paid tribute on X, writing: \"Diane Keaton. One of the greatest film actors ever. An icon of style, humor and comedy. Brilliant. What a person.\" Kate Hudson, whose mother is Goldie Hawn, posted simply: \"We love you so much Diane.\" In her Instagram tribute, Emmy, Grammy, Oscar, and Tony award-winning actress and producer Viola Davis said: \"No!! No!!! No!! God, not yet, NO!!! Man… you defined womanhood. \"The pathos, humor, levity, your ever-present youthfulness and vulnerability - you tattooed your SOUL into every role, making it impossible to imagine anyone else inhabiting them. \"You were undeniably, unapologetically YOU!!! Loved you. Man… rest well. God bless your family, and I know angels are flying you home.\" Keaton never married. She adopted her daughter Dexter in 1996 and a son, Duke, four years later."
