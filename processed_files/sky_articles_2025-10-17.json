        "Content": " The family of Virginia Giuffre has said Prince Andrew's decision to give up his titles, including the Duke of York, is \"vindication for our sister and survivors everywhere\". \"This is not just a victory for her, but for every single survivor of the horrific crimes perpetrated by [Jeffrey] Epstein and his co-conspirators,\" the family said in a statement. Andrew will no longer be known as the Duke of York, in a move which finally completes his banishment from royal life. However, he will remain a prince, having been born the son of Queen Elizabeth II. His former wife, Sarah Ferguson, will also no longer use her title of The Duchess of York, it is understood. In a statement, Prince Andrew said: \"In discussion with The King, and my immediate and wider family, we have concluded the continued accusations about me distract from the work of His Majesty and the Royal Family. \"I have decided, as I always have, to put my duty to my family and country first. I stand by my decision five years ago to stand back from public life. Follow updates: Prince Andrew latest: 'I must go a step further' \"With His Majesty's agreement, we feel I must now go a step further. I will therefore no longer use my title or the honours which have been conferred upon me. \"As I have said previously, I vigorously deny the accusations against me.\" King 'glad' of the outcome The decision comes following increased pressure on Prince Andrew after continuing reports of his relationship with paedophile financier Jeffrey Epstein, and his relationship with an alleged Chinese spy. It is understood that the change will take effect immediately.  The King is glad of the outcome, it is understood, and the decision was taken in close consultation with His Majesty and other members of the Royal Family. Read more from Sky News:Analysis: Clearly, this wasn't Andrew's decisionVirginia Giuffre describes alleged encounters with Andrew  He will continue to be known as Prince Andrew and will continue to live at the Windsor Estate at the Royal Lodge. The move also does not impact the position of his daughters, Princess Beatrice and Princess Eugenie. For the second year running, he is not expected to attend the Royal Family's annual Christmas celebrations at Sandringham. 'An unwelcome distraction' Sky News' royal correspondent, Rhiannon Mills, said: \"This is quite an extraordinary move. I think it shows that, actually, things had gone too far. \"Prince Andrew, and allegations about him and Virginia Giuffre, were continuing to be too much of a distraction for the Royal Family.\"  Jack Royston, chief royal correspondent at Newsweek, told Sky News: \"This does not go far enough\". He added what was needed was: \"An acknowledgement from the royal family that - irrespective of whether Prince Andrew denies the substantive allegations against him - it was morally wrong for him to grovel to Jeffrey Epstein.\" The Guardian's former royal correspondent Stephen Bates also told Sky News: \"He's shown no sign of any sort of contrition. He continues to deny all the allegations against him. And he speaks of his duty to the family. Well, it's a bit late to be thinking about that.\" What is Prince Andrew accused of? Prince Andrew has denied allegations made by Ms Giuffre - one of Epstein's victims - of sexual assault.  She had filed a civil lawsuit against Prince Andrew, accusing him of sexually assaulting her on three occasions after she was introduced to him by Epstein. In a 2019 interview with BBC Newsnight, he said he had no knowledge of ever meeting Ms Giuffre, claiming a well-known image of them together had been doctored. The case was settled outside of court for a sum believed to have been around Â£12m. Ms Giuffre died in April. Her family said Ms Giuffre \"lost her life to suicide\" at her farm in Western Australia, aged 41. Giuffre's family: 'Victory for Virginia' In a statement, the family of Ms Giuffre said they supported Andrew's decision but repeated accusations that he had made misleading statements. Andrew has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing. \"We, the family of Virginia Roberts Giuffre, believe that Prince Andrew's decision to give up his titles is vindication for our sister and survivors everywhere. \"This decisive action is a powerful step forward in our fight to bring Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell's child sex-trafficking network to justice. \"This moment serves as victory for Virginia, who consistently maintained, 'He knows what happened, I know what happened, and there's only one of us telling the truth, and I know that's me.' \"This is not just a victory for her, but for every single survivor of the horrific crimes perpetrated by Epstein and his co-conspirators.\" Anyone feeling emotionally distressed or suicidal can call Samaritans for help on 116 123 or email jo@samaritans.org in the UK.

        "Content": "\n          Royal correspondent\n              @SkyRhiannon\n It is extraordinary that it has come to this but the distraction had to stop. The statement comes straight from Prince Andrew, the tone of it very personal as he says he is putting his \"duty to my family and country first\". But this was clearly not entirely his decision. From the first sentence, where he says \"in discussion with the King\", we're left in no doubt that his brother must have said enough was enough. Royals latest: Andrew explains decision to give up titles The fact we're being guided that the King is glad of this outcome says it all; for the monarch and the wider family, the questions of what they were going to do about Andrew had to stop. After years of upset caused by his association with convicted paedophile Jeffrey Epstein, he has done the family one favour by personally announcing that he will no longer use his titles. \n                  'Victory for Virginia,' says family of Prince Andrew's accuser - as royal gives up all his titles\n                 \n                  Prince Andrew latest: King decided 'enough is enough' - as Duke gives up titles\n                 \n                  Prince Andrew's fall from grace is a never-ending saga - he's a perennial problem for the Palace\n                 For the King to forcibly remove them would have taken up precious parliamentary time and weeks of column inches. To be clear his titles aren't removed, they remain extant but inactive like his HRH title. But Prince Andrew won't use them any more and that will be humiliation enough for a man who has already been stripped of his military affiliations, his charity patronages and his ability to have any kind of public profile. Read more:Virginia Giuffre details accusation in posthumous bookSarah Ferguson explains message to Epstein This ends the questions on what more the monarch could do to show how the family felt about the accusations, the upset and the embarrassment caused. Will it stop the stories, the allegations and the interest in Prince Andrew? That is far less certain. But in what is the prince's first public statement since that ill-fated Newsnight interview in 2019, it is striking that he signs it off by saying: \"I vigorously deny the accusations against me.\""

        "Content": " Ukraine's hopes of securing Tomahawk missiles have been dashed by the US over fears it would spark an escalation, Volodymyr Zelenskyy has suggested. US President Donald Trump met with the Ukrainian president at the White House on Friday for the third time this year. Mr Zelenskyy's priority would have likely been securing Tomahawk missiles after three years of war with Russia, which was left worried by the prospect. The weapons have a significantly longer range than any other missiles in Ukraine's armoury. While Mr Trump did not rule out providing the Tomahawk missiles, he appeared cool to the prospect as he looked ahead to a meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Hungary in the coming weeks. 'US doesn't want escalation' Following the meeting with Mr Trump, who held a phone call with Mr Putin on Thursday, Mr Zelenskyy said: \"We spoke about long-range (missiles) of course. And I do not want to make statements about it.\" \n                  Could Tomahawk missiles be a game-changer for Ukraine and could they strike Moscow?\n                 \n                  Trump warns US may send long-range Tomahawk missiles to Ukraine unless Russia ends war\n                 \n                  Putin admits Russia shot down Azerbaijani passenger jet, killing 38\n                 But he added: \"We don't speak about it because... United States doesn't want this escalation. \"So, I mean, this will be out of the answer - sorry about it.\" Follow updates: Ukraine war latest: Zelenskyy proposes 'drone for Tomahawk' Later in a post on X, Mr Zelenskyy said he was counting on President Trump to \"bring this war closer to an end\". \"We discussed all key issues - our positions on the battlefield, long-range capabilities and air defence, and, of course, diplomatic prospects,\" he said. \"Russia must end the aggression it started and continues to deliberately prolong. We count on the United States' pressure.\" In a roundtable with journalists following the meeting, Mr Trump confirmed that hitting targets deep inside Russian territory would be an \"escalation\". He also said he was hesitant to tap into the US' supply of Tomahawks, saying: \"I have an obligation also to make sure that we're completely stocked up as a country, because you never know what's going to happen in war and peace. \"We'd much rather have them not need Tomahawks.

'United Kingdom's resolute support for Ukraine' A Downing Street spokesperson said: \"The prime minister spoke to the president of Ukraine, European leaders and the NATO secretary general this evening following President Zelenskyy's visit to the White House today. \"The leaders reiterated their unwavering commitment to Ukraine in the face of ongoing Russian aggression. A just and lasting peace for Ukraine was the only way to stop the killing for good, they agreed. \"Further discussions about how they could support Ukraine in the lead up to, and following, a ceasefire would continue this week, including in a Coalition of the Willing call on Friday, the leaders agreed. \"Following the call with world leaders this evening, the prime minister then spoke to President Zelenskyy bilaterally to underscore the United Kingdom's resolute support for Ukraine.\""

        "Content": "\n          US correspondent\n              @marthakelner\n Before Donald Trump met with Volodymyr Zelenskyy, he hosted one of his favourite singers, Andrea Bocelli, in the Oval Office. The Italian tenor serenaded him with the signature track Time To Say Goodbye, a song about hope and new beginnings. But the next event on his agenda suggested antipathy between Trump and the Ukrainian president are firmly lodged in the past. On the key issue of whether Vladimir Putin actually wants peace, the pair continue to fundamentally disagree.  Trump repeated several times his belief that Putin is committed to ending the war, which may come as a surprise to the people of eastern Ukraine, being pummeled by an expanded Russian offensive in the past few months. Trump also spoke about \"bad blood on both sides\", again inferring equal blame on Zelenskyy, whose sovereign nation was invaded, and Putin, who is doing the invading. It's in Putin's gift to stop the fighting immediately, but that was glossed over. \n                  Hungary convenient for next Putin-Trump summit - but getting there might not be so straightforward\n                 \n                  Who are the Trump critics that could face decades behind bars after being indicted?\n                 \n                  Trump and Putin: Friends reunited?\n                 Zelenskyy, clearly contorted by a need to put the record straight but not anger the famously mercurial man on the other side of the table, fired back that it is the Ukrainians who are committed to a ceasefire, a trilateral meeting and ultimately, an end to this war. Ukraine war: Zelenskyy proposes 'drone for Tomahawk' deal Relations between Zelenskyy and Trump have, obviously, improved from February when the Ukrainian president was berated and left the White House early. On that occasion, he was mocked for wearing a T-shirt and so, the next two visits, he has sported an all black suit. He has also learned that Trump responds to flattery and, accordingly, he peppered the president with compliments. He credited him with \"managing the ceasefire in the Middle East\", and said he believes he has a \"chance\" to do the same in Ukraine. Trump came into the meeting buoyed by the diplomatic success of the past fortnight in the Middle East, intoxicated by the praise he has received from all sides for brokering the hostage deal. But the war, he said he could solve in 24 hours, is proving a tougher nut to crack, and he's growing frustrated with everyone involved. That much could be gleaned from his Truth Social post after the meeting, which implored Putin and Zelenskyy to end the war along its current lines. \"Let both claim Victory, let History decide!\" he wrote. Read more from Sky News:Zelenskyy on US 'long-range' weaponsPutin faces difficult trip to summitTrump's 'game of diplomatic chess' It was a marked shift from less than a month ago, when Trump, at that point more angered by Putin, suggested Ukraine could potentially win back all its territory. As recently as Sunday, he was threatening to send long-range Tomahawk missiles to Ukraine but he made clear after their meeting that he wouldn't be doing that right now. It's likely he will wait until at least after his trailed meeting with Putin in Budapest. ð Follow Trump100 on your podcast app ð I was in Alaska in August when Trump hosted Putin and laid out the literal and metaphorical red carpet for him. The US president went in with two aims: to broker a ceasefire and a one-on-one meeting between Putin and Zelenskyy. He left with neither and there is no public sign that Putin has shifted from his maximalist aims in Ukraine. Even by Trump's own measurement, the summit was a failure. Yet he seems determined to take the Russian president at his word, granting him first a phone call ahead of the Zelenskyy visit to Washington DC and now another meeting. Putin was first successful in getting Trump to hold off on more severe sanctions on Russia, which were crippling economically. Now he has, seemingly, played a role in persuading Trump to hold off on sending Tomahawk missiles to Ukraine. The US president was asked by a journalist whether it was possible he was being played by Putin. He admitted it was possible but said he usually comes out of these things pretty well. Time will tell."

        "Content": "By Sam Doak and Ben van der Merwe, Data and Forensics Unit   It's the dead of night, and a convoy is driving along a road in Gaza's far north, 1.4km inside the Israeli area of control. Few people remain in this part of Gaza, near the Erez border crossing. Almost all buildings here have been destroyed, and official data says that no aid has come through the crossing since February. These vehicles, however, are loaded with supplies. They stop briefly as a child and two men disembark to collect water bottles and plastic jerrycans that had fallen off one of the overburdened pickup trucks. The convoy moves south, past destroyed buildings and debris, ending at an abandoned school. This is the headquarters of the militia led by Ashraf Al Mansi, which calls itself the People's Army. Earlier this week, Al Mansi released a video statement warning Hamas against approaching the areas under his control. The armed group is one of four active anti-Hamas militias identified by Sky News - all of them based inside parts of Gaza still controlled by Israel. Hamas has sought to reassert its authority in recent days by clamping down on such groups. Sky News has verified footage of gun battles and public executions on the streets of Gaza City.  Last week, a Sky News investigation revealed that Israel has been facilitating the supply of guns, vehicles, cash and food to the most influential of these militias, Yasser Abu Shabab's Popular Forces, based in Gaza's far south.  The new footage viewed by Sky News suggests a similar arrangement has been set up in Gaza's far north to supply Al Mansi's militia. The IDF and Al Mansi did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Why are the videos important? Two videos, uploaded by a member of Al Mansi's militia on 9 and 11 October, show convoys taking an identical route down to the militia's headquarters. Neither video shows the supplies being loaded onto the trucks, but both videos begin at a point less than 400 metres from an IDF outpost. To the north of this point, the road branches off in two. The western branch leads to the IDF outpost, while the eastern branch leads to the Erez border crossing. It's not possible to determine exactly what is being transported, but we can see food, water bottles and a large amount of fuel. At one point in one of the videos, the back of a car is shown filled with plastic jerrycans. These are marked with the branding of SOS Energy, an Israeli fuel supplier. Hamas is cracking down on the militias The new evidence of Israeli backing for Gaza's militias comes as Hamas is attempting to reassert its authority through a violent crackdown on suspected collaborators. On Thursday, Israeli news website Mako reported that Hamas had managed to take control of at least 45 pickup trucks, cash and hundreds of weapons from militias backed by Israel, citing IDF sources. The crackdown has included a multi-day assault on Gaza City's Al Sabra neighbourhood, home to the Doghmosh clan - an influential extended family with a long history of tensions with Hamas. Clan members told Sky News that Hamas's attack, which began as an attempt to arrest members of an anti-Hamas militia, had morphed into an indiscriminate campaign of revenge against the family as a whole. \"Hamas has not targeted any family,\" Hamas spokesman Hazem Qassem told Sky News. \"The occupation has formed armed militias loyal to it, and these militias are accused of high treason - the most severe charge in Palestinian revolutionary law.\" The head of Gaza's Supreme Council for Tribal Affairs Hosni Al Mughanni tells Sky News that Yasser Abu Shabab \"deserves the harshest punishment for his crimes\" and that he \"threw himself into the enemy's arms\". \"These rogue groups terrified us more than the enemy at times, violating people's sanctities and property, stripping them of cash, phones, even watches, and shooting legs,\" he says. We asked Al Mughanni about the summary executions that have taken place in recent days in Gaza City. \"With no functioning courts, prosecution, or police stations, all of which are destroyed, how can formal justice proceed? \"We are for restoring security, security is the basis of life.\" Additional reporting by Celine Alkhaldi, Middle East producer.

        "Content": " Three neo-Nazis who plotted terrorist attacks on mosques and synagogues have been jailed for a total of 29 years. Brogan Stewart was sentenced to 11 years in prison, Christopher Ringrose for 10 years and Marco Pitzettu for eight years by a judge at Sheffield Crown Court on Friday. Stewart, 25, Ringrose, 34, and Pitzettu, 25, stockpiled body armour and more than 200 weapons including crossbows, swords, machetes, axes, hunting knives and had 3D-printed parts of a gun. An almost completed FGC-9 Mk II printed assault rifle found in Ringrose's loft was missing the barrel and firing pin, but the men were sourcing the components to complete the weapon, which prosecutors said could then \"have been used to devastating consequences\". The court heard the trio had a shared interest in bushcraft and YouTube videos of \"preppers\" - who prepare for the possibility of a world-changing disaster by stockpiling supplies, food and ammunition. But prosecutors said they were preparing for a race war and had used the online communities to recruit an inner circle, which moved on to neo-Nazi chat groups before setting up their own private group, as they prepared to take action. It was infiltrated by an undercover officer on 5 January last year. Stewart messaged the officer on the encrypted Telegram app, telling him he was disillusioned with other far-right groups that just \"sit around and talk,\" adding: \"I want to get my own group together because action speaks louder than words.\" Self-appointed leader Stewart, of Tingley, Wakefield, West Yorkshire, appointed Ringrose, of Cannock, Staffordshire, and Pitzettu, of Mickleover, Derbyshire, as \"armourers\" and they discussed getting a uniform as well as potential targets, including mosques and synagogues. In a group call on 5 February last year, they said the plan was to \"cruise around\" looking for \"human targets\" near an Islamic education centre, \"do whatever we do, then back at mine for tea and medals and a debrief\". Before the \"operation\" went ahead, Stewart wanted the members, who had never met in person, to \"hang out, bring ourselves closer together and just cement that brotherhood\" on 18 February. But the event did not go ahead, and the group were arrested on 20 February after counter-terrorism police raided properties in Yorkshire, Derbyshire and Staffordshire. All three men were found guilty of preparing acts of terrorism and possessing information useful for terrorism in May. At trial, a jury ignored defence arguments that the defendants were fantasists with no intention of carrying out their threats. Ringrose was also convicted of manufacturing the lower receiver for a 3D firearm, a prohibited weapon, while Pitzettu pleaded guilty to possessing a stun gun. Jurors heard how the defendants formed an online group called Einsatz 14 in January 2024, with \"like-minded extremists\" who wanted to \"go to war for their chosen cause\". Stewart told the group: \"Hitler did more for his people than any politician. And for Britain to have a p*** and zionist in charge of the country is absolutely outrageous.\" Prosecutors said this last comment was a reference to then prime minister Rishi Sunak. Sentencing them, judge Mrs Justice Cutts said she believed they all continued to adhere to their extreme right-wing ideology. All would be dangerous after their release from prison, she said, noting the group's ideology was \"laid bare\" in a 374-page dossier of internet activity presented to jurors. The document was \"filled with hate towards black and other non-white races, especially Muslim people and immigrants, with ideas of white supremacy and racial purity together with a belief that there must soon be a race war\". It featured the \"glorification and admiration of the policies and actions of Hitler and the German Nazi Party, including antisemitism, and of mass killers who had targeted black or Muslim communities\". The judge said she did not believe a terrorist attack was \"imminent\", but \"was likely in the not too distant future\". Read more on Sky News:Talks over ban on Israeli fansPalestine Action can challenge terror ban Detective Chief Superintendent James Dunkerley, head of Counter Terrorism Policing North East, said the group came together because of their \"extreme racist views\". \"They've idolised the Nazi party, they've glorified mass murders, and they share a hatred of groups such as the Jewish community and the Muslim community,\" he said. \"I genuinely believe had we not taken action, this group could've carried out a violent attack and the consequences of that attack could've been fatal.\""

        "Content": "The family of Mango founder Isak Andic, who died after falling from a cliff, say his son did not play any part in the incident. It comes after several local media outlets in Spain reported that Mr Andic's death was being investigated as a possible homicide. The billionaire founder of the fashion chain reportedly slipped and fell from a 150-metre cliff while hiking in the Monserrat caves, near Barcelona, last December. La Vanguardia newspaper reported late on Thursday that one element the judge looking into Mr Andic's death was investigating was contradictory statements Mr Andic's son Jonathan gave as a witness, and that authorities were searching his phone for more evidence. However, the newspaper reported that, during the 10-month probe, investigators had not found any conclusive evidence linking Jonathan to his father's death. Barcelona court's press office said on Friday that the case, which is still sealed, wasn't directed at any particular individual. The Andic family said it expected Jonathan to be proven innocent.

        "Content": "A convicted murderer has admitted to killing his pregnant girlfriend by stabbing her 19 times at her home in Walthamstow, northeast London. Shaine March, 47, of Surrey Quays, London, attacked Alana Odysseos, 32, while she was in the early stages of pregnancy with her third child on July 22 last year. A court heard they had an argument hours before over whether to abort their unborn child, with Ms Odysseos to have said: \"I don't want to kill my baby.\" March previously admitted to manslaughter by diminished responsibility, but denied murder. Today, March, who had been released from prison on licence, changed his plea and admitted to the murder of Ms Odysseos. The plea came after it emerged during legal arguments on Thursday that a defence expert due to give evidence in his trial no longer supported his diminished responsibility claim. Following the guilty plea, Mr Justice Murray discharged the jury and lifted reporting restrictions of March's previous conviction for murder. Now it can be reported that March was aged 21 when he killed a man by stabbing him in the neck at a McDonald's restaurant, back in January 2000. He was convicted of the murder of Andre Drummond, 17, in July that year and jailed. March was then released on licence in early 2013. But he was recalled to jail later that year after an assault on another partner in July, and released again in February 2018. Before the killing, March had been seeing Ms Odysseos for around four months.

She was bleeding from multiple stab wounds and shouted: \"Shaine stabbed me, he stabbed me. Help, help.\" March walked away and the victim died on the ground outside her home, having suffered stab wounds to her chest, stomach, pelvis, shoulders, buttocks, right arm, thighs and lower legs. Before throwing his mobile phone in a drain, March recorded a voice note saying: \"Mum, I just killed a woman, and I'm going back to jail.\" Following his arrest, March allegedly told police: \"I did it. I killed her Alana Odysseos. I killed her hahahaha.\" March has been remanded in custody ahead of sentencing on October 31."

He had been accused by Virginia Giuffre, who died in April, of sexually assaulting her. He denies this.

Sky News understands this will be immediate. He will also give up his knighthood as a Knight Grand Cross of the Royal Victorian Order (GCVO) and his Garter role as a Royal Knight Companion of the Most Noble Order of the Garter. He will retain the dukedom, which can only be removed by an Act of Parliament, but will not use it. Prince Andrew will also remain a prince, having been born the son of Elizabeth II. What has he been accused of? Ms Giuffre, who was one of Epstein's victims, alleged Prince Andrew sexually assaulted her on three occasions when she was 17. In her posthumous memoir Nobody's Girl, she alleged that Prince Andrew was \"entitled\" and \"believed having sex with me was his birthright\". Prince Andrew has always denied the allegations. He has also always claimed that a well-known image of them together had been doctored. Before her death, which her family said was by suicide, the case was settled outside of court for a sum believed to have been around Â£12m. Where will he live? Sky News understands that he will continue to live at the Windsor Estate at the Royal Lodge. But for the second year running he will not be attending the Royal Family's annual Christmas celebrations at Sandringham, it is understood. Will it impact the Princesses? The decision, which is understood to have left the King feeling glad, will not impact on the position of his daughters, Princess Beatrice and Princess Eugenie, it is also understood. But Sky News' royal correspondent, Rhiannon Mills, explains how it may not stop the influx of negative stories about him. She said: \"This ends the questions on what more the monarch could do to show how the family felt about the accusations, the upset and the embarrassment caused. \"Will it stop the stories, the allegations and the interest in Prince Andrew? That is far less certain. But in what is the Prince's first public statement since that ill-fated Newsnight interview in 2019, it is striking that he signs it off by saying \"I vigorously deny the accusations against me\". What did Prince Andrew say? In a statement, Prince Andrew said: \"In discussion with The King, and my immediate and wider family, we have concluded the continued accusations about me distract from the work of His Majesty and the Royal Family. \"I have decided, as I always have, to put my duty to my family and country first. I stand by my decision five years ago to stand back from public life. \"With His Majesty's agreement, we feel I must now go a step further.

'An unwelcome distraction' Sky News' royal correspondent, Rhiannon Mills, said: \"This is quite an extraordinary move. I think it shows that, actually, things had gone too far. \"Prince Andrew, and allegations about him and Virginia Giuffre, were continuing to be too much of a distraction for the Royal Family.\"  Jack Royston, chief royal correspondent at Newsweek, told Sky News: \"This does not go far enough\". He added what was needed was: \"An acknowledgement from the royal family that - irrespective of whether Prince Andrew denies the substantive allegations against him - it was morally wrong for him to grovel to Jeffrey Epstein.\" The Guardian's former royal correspondent Stephen Bates also told Sky News: \"He's shown no sign of any sort of contrition. He continues to deny all the allegations against him. And he speaks of his duty to the family. Well, it's a bit late to be thinking about that.\" What is Prince Andrew accused of? Prince Andrew has denied allegations made by Ms Giuffre - one of Epstein's victims - of sexual assault.  She had filed a civil lawsuit against Prince Andrew, accusing him of sexually assaulting her on three occasions after she was introduced to him by Epstein.

The case was settled outside of court for a sum believed to have been around Â£12m. Ms Giuffre died in April.

Giuffre's family: 'Victory for Virginia' In a statement, the family of Ms Giuffre said they supported Andrew's decision but repeated accusations that he had made misleading statements. Andrew has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing. \"We, the family of Virginia Roberts Giuffre, believe that Prince Andrew's decision to give up his titles is vindication for our sister and survivors everywhere. \"This decisive action is a powerful step forward in our fight to bring Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell's child sex-trafficking network to justice. \"This moment serves as victory for Virginia, who consistently maintained, 'He knows what happened, I know what happened, and there's only one of us telling the truth, and I know that's me.' \"This is not just a victory for her, but for every single survivor of the horrific crimes perpetrated by Epstein and his co-conspirators.\" Anyone feeling emotionally distressed or suicidal can call Samaritans for help on 116 123 or email jo@samaritans.org in the UK.

        "Content": "\n          Royal correspondent\n              @SkyRhiannon\n The King will become the first British monarch to pray publicly with the Pope since the Reformation 500 years ago during a state visit to the Holy See next week. The King and Queen will meet the new pontiff Pope Leo XIV at the Apostolic Palace, his official residence, next Thursday during their trip to Vatican City. In a highly significant moment in relations between the Catholic Church and Church of England, of which His Majesty is Supreme Governor, the King and Queen and the Pope will attend a special ecumenical service in the Sistine Chapel celebrating the ongoing work towards unity and cooperation among different Christian churches. The decision for the King and Pope to pray together during the service will be the first time a monarch and the pontiff have joined together in this type of moment of reflection in the 500 years since the Reformation when, in 1534, King Henry VIII declared himself as head of the Church of England and broke from the papal authority of the Rome Catholic Church.  In another historic step, the King will be made \"Royal Confrater\" of the Abbey of St Paul's Outside the Walls. The abbot of the community and the archpriest of the basilica wished to confer the title and received the Pope's approval to do so. To mark the occasion a special seat has been made decorated with the King's coat of arms. Read more:King Charles pays tribute to Pope FrancisKing and Queen meet Pope Francis at the Vatican The King will use it during the service, after which it will remain in the apse of the basilica for future use by His Majesty and his heirs and successors. English Kings had a particular link with The Papal Basilica of St Paul's Outside the Walls until the Reformation. It is also known as the Papal Basilica where reconciliation, ecumenism and relationships across the Christian faith are celebrated.  A spokesperson for the Church of England said: \"The royal confrater title, whilst it confers no duties or obligations on the King, and makes no changes whatsoever to the formal, constitutional and ecclesiastical position of His Majesty as the Supreme Governor of the Church of England, it is a tribute to his majesty and his own work over many decades to find common ground between faiths and to bring people together.\" The trip comes during the Catholic Church's 2025 Jubilee year. Held traditionally every 25 years, \"Pilgrims of Hope\" is the theme of this jubilee. The visit will also reflect the joint commitment from both Pope Leo and the King to protect nature and their shared concern for the environment. The service at the Sistine Chapel will have the theme of \"Care for Creation\" and they will attend a meeting on sustainability. A spokesperson from the Foreign Office said: \"At a time of growing instability and conflict, the UK's relationship with the Holy See is more important than ever. The Holy See is a key international actor. \"We work with the Holy See to promote human dignity, to promote peace and combat climate change... so His Majesty's visit will strengthen the UK's relationship with this crucial and influential global partner.\" Read more on Sky News:Vatican must do more to help sexual abuse victimsPope Leo's revealing birthday interview Only in 1961 did Queen Elizabeth II became the first British monarch since the Reformation to make an official visit to the Holy See. In April of this year, a royal visit had to be cancelled due to the ill health of Pope Francis, but both the King and Queen did meet him privately while on a trip to Rome. It is understood Pope Leo and the King have been actively engaged in how this reorganised visit will look and the themes it will cover."

The gender recognition panel had declined to issue the man - known as W - with a certificate, stating he had not explained why \"it was not incompatible to live as a man when trying to conceive and carry a pregnancy\". The man challenged the decision at the High Court in London and on Friday, Mr Justice Hayden ruled in his favour and granted the GRC. In his written judgment, he said: \"It is clear that there are two main currents coursing through the applicant's life: his clear and settled identification as male, in which sex I find there is abundant evidence that he continues to live, and his desire to have a family. \"In my judgment, there is nothing further he could do to reconcile these two powerful instincts. \"To require him to abandon either one for the other would be to dismantle and fracture the person he is.\" He added: \"I am satisfied that the applicant continues to live in his acquired gender and intends to do so for the rest of his life.\" The court also found the panel had been \"plainly wrong\" to suggest the man had not taken up its offer to share an input on whether his wish to conceive a child was incompatible with his \"declared intention\" to live as a male for the rest of his life. Mr Justice Hayden said: \"The fact that the newly constituted panel were apparently unaware of the applicant's contribution is fatal to the integrity of their decision.

        "Content": " Three neo-Nazis who plotted terrorist attacks on mosques and synagogues have been jailed for a total of 29 years. Brogan Stewart was sentenced to 11 years in prison, Christopher Ringrose for 10 years and Marco Pitzettu for eight years by a judge at Sheffield Crown Court on Friday. Stewart, 25, Ringrose, 34, and Pitzettu, 25, stockpiled body armour and more than 200 weapons including crossbows, swords, machetes, axes, hunting knives and had 3D-printed parts of a gun. An almost completed FGC-9 Mk II printed assault rifle found in Ringrose's loft was missing the barrel and firing pin, but the men were sourcing the components to complete the weapon, which prosecutors said could then \"have been used to devastating consequences\". The court heard the trio had a shared interest in bushcraft and YouTube videos of \"preppers\" - who prepare for the possibility of a world-changing disaster by stockpiling supplies, food and ammunition. But prosecutors said they were preparing for a race war and had used the online communities to recruit an inner circle, which moved on to neo-Nazi chat groups before setting up their own private group, as they prepared to take action. It was infiltrated by an undercover officer on 5 January last year. Stewart messaged the officer on the encrypted Telegram app, telling him he was disillusioned with other far-right groups that just \"sit around and talk,\" adding: \"I want to get my own group together because action speaks louder than words.\" Self-appointed leader Stewart, of Tingley, Wakefield, West Yorkshire, appointed Ringrose, of Cannock, Staffordshire, and Pitzettu, of Mickleover, Derbyshire, as \"armourers\" and they discussed getting a uniform as well as potential targets, including mosques and synagogues. In a group call on 5 February last year, they said the plan was to \"cruise around\" looking for \"human targets\" near an Islamic education centre, \"do whatever we do, then back at mine for tea and medals and a debrief\". Before the \"operation\" went ahead, Stewart wanted the members, who had never met in person, to \"hang out, bring ourselves closer together and just cement that brotherhood\" on 18 February. But the event did not go ahead, and the group were arrested on 20 February after counter-terrorism police raided properties in Yorkshire, Derbyshire and Staffordshire. All three men were found guilty of preparing acts of terrorism and possessing information useful for terrorism in May. At trial, a jury ignored defence arguments that the defendants were fantasists with no intention of carrying out their threats. Ringrose was also convicted of manufacturing the lower receiver for a 3D firearm, a prohibited weapon, while Pitzettu pleaded guilty to possessing a stun gun. Jurors heard how the defendants formed an online group called Einsatz 14 in January 2024, with \"like-minded extremists\" who wanted to \"go to war for their chosen cause\". Stewart told the group: \"Hitler did more for his people than any politician. And for Britain to have a p*** and zionist in charge of the country is absolutely outrageous.\" Prosecutors said this last comment was a reference to then prime minister Rishi Sunak. Sentencing them, judge Mrs Justice Cutts said she believed they all continued to adhere to their extreme right-wing ideology. All would be dangerous after their release from prison, she said, noting the group's ideology was \"laid bare\" in a 374-page dossier of internet activity presented to jurors. The document was \"filled with hate towards black and other non-white races, especially Muslim people and immigrants, with ideas of white supremacy and racial purity together with a belief that there must soon be a race war\". It featured the \"glorification and admiration of the policies and actions of Hitler and the German Nazi Party, including antisemitism, and of mass killers who had targeted black or Muslim communities\". The judge said she did not believe a terrorist attack was \"imminent\", but \"was likely in the not too distant future\". Read more on Sky News:Talks over ban on Israeli fansPalestine Action can challenge terror ban Detective Chief Superintendent James Dunkerley, head of Counter Terrorism Policing North East, said the group came together because of their \"extreme racist views\". \"They've idolised the Nazi party, they've glorified mass murders, and they share a hatred of groups such as the Jewish community and the Muslim community,\" he said. \"I genuinely believe had we not taken action, this group could've carried out a violent attack and the consequences of that attack could've been fatal.\""

        "Content": "A convicted murderer has admitted to killing his pregnant girlfriend by stabbing her 19 times at her home in Walthamstow, northeast London. Shaine March, 47, of Surrey Quays, London, attacked Alana Odysseos, 32, while she was in the early stages of pregnancy with her third child on July 22 last year. A court heard they had an argument hours before over whether to abort their unborn child, with Ms Odysseos to have said: \"I don't want to kill my baby.\" March previously admitted to manslaughter by diminished responsibility, but denied murder. Today, March, who had been released from prison on licence, changed his plea and admitted to the murder of Ms Odysseos. The plea came after it emerged during legal arguments on Thursday that a defence expert due to give evidence in his trial no longer supported his diminished responsibility claim. Following the guilty plea, Mr Justice Murray discharged the jury and lifted reporting restrictions of March's previous conviction for murder. Now it can be reported that March was aged 21 when he killed a man by stabbing him in the neck at a McDonald's restaurant, back in January 2000. He was convicted of the murder of Andre Drummond, 17, in July that year and jailed. March was then released on licence in early 2013. But he was recalled to jail later that year after an assault on another partner in July, and released again in February 2018. Before the killing, March had been seeing Ms Odysseos for around four months. Read more UK news from Sky News:Palestine Action can challenge terror banManchester Arena bomb plotter denies attempted murder Members of the public, in Lynmouth Road, rang 999 after finding Ms Odysseos outside her home wearing a nightie and dressing gown, clutching her right side. She was bleeding from multiple stab wounds and shouted: \"Shaine stabbed me, he stabbed me. Help, help.\" March walked away and the victim died on the ground outside her home, having suffered stab wounds to her chest, stomach, pelvis, shoulders, buttocks, right arm, thighs and lower legs. Before throwing his mobile phone in a drain, March recorded a voice note saying: \"Mum, I just killed a woman, and I'm going back to jail.\" Following his arrest, March allegedly told police: \"I did it. I killed her Alana Odysseos. I killed her hahahaha.\" March has been remanded in custody ahead of sentencing on October 31."

We count on the United States' pressure.\" In a roundtable with journalists following the meeting, Mr Trump confirmed that hitting targets deep inside Russian territory would be an \"escalation\".

The Italian tenor serenaded him with the signature track Time To Say Goodbye, a song about hope and new beginnings. But the next event on his agenda suggested antipathy between Trump and the Ukrainian president are firmly lodged in the past. On the key issue of whether Vladimir Putin actually wants peace, the pair continue to fundamentally disagree.  Trump repeated several times his belief that Putin is committed to ending the war, which may come as a surprise to the people of eastern Ukraine, being pummeled by an expanded Russian offensive in the past few months. Trump also spoke about \"bad blood on both sides\", again inferring equal blame on Zelenskyy, whose sovereign nation was invaded, and Putin, who is doing the invading. It's in Putin's gift to stop the fighting immediately, but that was glossed over. \n                  Hungary convenient for next Putin-Trump summit - but getting there might not be so straightforward\n                 \n                  Who are the Trump critics that could face decades behind bars after being indicted?\n                 \n                  Trump and Putin: Friends reunited?\n                 Zelenskyy, clearly contorted by a need to put the record straight but not anger the famously mercurial man on the other side of the table, fired back that it is the Ukrainians who are committed to a ceasefire, a trilateral meeting and ultimately, an end to this war. Ukraine war: Zelenskyy proposes 'drone for Tomahawk' deal Relations between Zelenskyy and Trump have, obviously, improved from February when the Ukrainian president was berated and left the White House early. On that occasion, he was mocked for wearing a T-shirt and so, the next two visits, he has sported an all black suit. He has also learned that Trump responds to flattery and, accordingly, he peppered the president with compliments. He credited him with \"managing the ceasefire in the Middle East\", and said he believes he has a \"chance\" to do the same in Ukraine. Trump came into the meeting buoyed by the diplomatic success of the past fortnight in the Middle East, intoxicated by the praise he has received from all sides for brokering the hostage deal. But the war, he said he could solve in 24 hours, is proving a tougher nut to crack, and he's growing frustrated with everyone involved. That much could be gleaned from his Truth Social post after the meeting, which implored Putin and Zelenskyy to end the war along its current lines. \"Let both claim Victory, let History decide!\" he wrote. Read more from Sky News:Zelenskyy on US 'long-range' weaponsPutin faces difficult trip to summitTrump's 'game of diplomatic chess' It was a marked shift from less than a month ago, when Trump, at that point more angered by Putin, suggested Ukraine could potentially win back all its territory. As recently as Sunday, he was threatening to send long-range Tomahawk missiles to Ukraine but he made clear after their meeting that he wouldn't be doing that right now. It's likely he will wait until at least after his trailed meeting with Putin in Budapest. ð Follow Trump100 on your podcast app ð I was in Alaska in August when Trump hosted Putin and laid out the literal and metaphorical red carpet for him. The US president went in with two aims: to broker a ceasefire and a one-on-one meeting between Putin and Zelenskyy. He left with neither and there is no public sign that Putin has shifted from his maximalist aims in Ukraine. Even by Trump's own measurement, the summit was a failure. Yet he seems determined to take the Russian president at his word, granting him first a phone call ahead of the Zelenskyy visit to Washington DC and now another meeting. Putin was first successful in getting Trump to hold off on more severe sanctions on Russia, which were crippling economically. Now he has, seemingly, played a role in persuading Trump to hold off on sending Tomahawk missiles to Ukraine. The US president was asked by a journalist whether it was possible he was being played by Putin. He admitted it was possible but said he usually comes out of these things pretty well. Time will tell."

That won't happen though. Putin is wanted by the International Criminal Court on charges issued in 2023 for the abduction of children in Ukraine during Russia's invasion. Although Hungary is a member of the ICC - a founding member no less - it is in the process of withdrawing from the global body, having accused it of being a \"political court\". Ukraine war latest - Trump to host Zelenskyy at White House  The ICC has no enforcement mechanism and relies on member states to take action so Hungary, which could and probably will just decide to ignore the court's arrest warrant, has no doubt given the Russian president assurances he will be safe in Budapest just as they did when another leader wanted for war crimes, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, visited the country last April. Neither Russia nor the United States are signatories to the court either, so it is a convenient location for the Trump-Putin meeting to discuss the situation in Ukraine that was announced on Thursday night. It would be the first known trip to an EU country by Putin since the war began in February 2022. However, actually getting to Budapest might not be so straightforward for Putin. Unless he flies a circuitous route over Turkey and through the Balkans, Putin will need to pass through the airspace of European countries who might consider forcing his plane down - Poland, Romania or the Baltic states for example. It's that kind of risk, however unlikely, that led Mr Netanyahu to fly around Spain and France on a recent trip to the UN General Assembly in New York. Putin did travel to an ICC member, Mongolia, last year and he has been to North Korea and China, neither of whom are part of the global court - otherwise, he has largely remained inside Russia, paranoid, surrounded by an ever-decreasing circle of advisers. You can hide from an arrest warrant at home, but step outside and the world suddenly becomes a hostile place."

        "Content": "By Sam Doak and Ben van der Merwe, Data and Forensics Unit   It's the dead of night, and a convoy is driving along a road in Gaza's far north, 1.4km inside the Israeli area of control. Few people remain in this part of Gaza, near the Erez border crossing. Almost all buildings here have been destroyed, and official data says that no aid has come through the crossing since February. These vehicles, however, are loaded with supplies. They stop briefly as a child and two men disembark to collect water bottles and plastic jerrycans that had fallen off one of the overburdened pickup trucks. The convoy moves south, past destroyed buildings and debris, ending at an abandoned school. This is the headquarters of the militia led by Ashraf Al Mansi, which calls itself the People's Army. Earlier this week, Al Mansi released a video statement warning Hamas against approaching the areas under his control. The armed group is one of four active anti-Hamas militias identified by Sky News - all of them based inside parts of Gaza still controlled by Israel. Hamas has sought to reassert its authority in recent days by clamping down on such groups. Sky News has verified footage of gun battles and public executions on the streets of Gaza City.  Last week, a Sky News investigation revealed that Israel has been facilitating the supply of guns, vehicles, cash and food to the most influential of these militias, Yasser Abu Shabab's Popular Forces, based in Gaza's far south.  The new footage viewed by Sky News suggests a similar arrangement has been set up in Gaza's far north to supply Al Mansi's militia. The IDF and Al Mansi did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Why are the videos important? Two videos, uploaded by a member of Al Mansi's militia on 9 and 11 October, show convoys taking an identical route down to the militia's headquarters. Neither video shows the supplies being loaded onto the trucks, but both videos begin at a point less than 400 metres from an IDF outpost. To the north of this point, the road branches off in two. The western branch leads to the IDF outpost, while the eastern branch leads to the Erez border crossing. It's not possible to determine exactly what is being transported, but we can see food, water bottles and a large amount of fuel. At one point in one of the videos, the back of a car is shown filled with plastic jerrycans. These are marked with the branding of SOS Energy, an Israeli fuel supplier. Hamas is cracking down on the militias The new evidence of Israeli backing for Gaza's militias comes as Hamas is attempting to reassert its authority through a violent crackdown on suspected collaborators. On Thursday, Israeli news website Mako reported that Hamas had managed to take control of at least 45 pickup trucks, cash and hundreds of weapons from militias backed by Israel, citing IDF sources. The crackdown has included a multi-day assault on Gaza City's Al Sabra neighbourhood, home to the Doghmosh clan - an influential extended family with a long history of tensions with Hamas. Clan members told Sky News that Hamas's attack, which began as an attempt to arrest members of an anti-Hamas militia, had morphed into an indiscriminate campaign of revenge against the family as a whole. \"Hamas has not targeted any family,\" Hamas spokesman Hazem Qassem told Sky News. \"The occupation has formed armed militias loyal to it, and these militias are accused of high treason - the most severe charge in Palestinian revolutionary law.\" The head of Gaza's Supreme Council for Tribal Affairs Hosni Al Mughanni tells Sky News that Yasser Abu Shabab \"deserves the harshest punishment for his crimes\" and that he \"threw himself into the enemy's arms\". \"These rogue groups terrified us more than the enemy at times, violating people's sanctities and property, stripping them of cash, phones, even watches, and shooting legs,\" he says. We asked Al Mughanni about the summary executions that have taken place in recent days in Gaza City. \"With no functioning courts, prosecution, or police stations, all of which are destroyed, how can formal justice proceed? \"We are for restoring security, security is the basis of life.\" Additional reporting by Celine Alkhaldi, Middle East producer.

Professor Noa Eliakim-Raz, head of returning hostages at Rabin Medical Center in Petah Tikva, Israel, said returned hostages may have lost \"their ability to make decisions\". On Monday, Hamas handed over all 20 surviving hostages, held in Gaza, in exchange for around 1,900 Palestinian prisoners. But Professor Eliakim-Raz warned they face health problems that medics are treating. 'It can even be life-threatening' Speaking to Sky News' Sally Lockwood, Professor Eliakim-Raz said: \"We were concerned in the first couple of days about refeeding syndrome, which is reintroducing food after a long time if you were someone who ate a very little amount of food, especially carbohydrates, and reintroducing food can cause damage to the body. \"There are electrolytes changes and shifts in fluids in the body when you reintroduce food quickly.

'In captivity you lose the ability to make decisions' Professor Eliakim-Raz added: \"When you are in captivity you lose the ability to make decisions and we try to give them back their identity. \"I totally feel it's a life-changing experience for me, I feel it has changed the way I look at very simple things in life and how I appreciate simple things in life. \"These people are coming from a place that tried to erase their identity, to erase humanity, very basic things that we feel as human beings. \"They came to the ward smiling, they know how to show appreciation, they show friendship, and that's always amazing. 'Some have social issues' \"I think as a medical profession we are obliged to give medical assistance and humanitarian terms to everyone. That's what we do and we swore to do. That's what I think should happen everywhere.\" She added: \"It's very different, one from the other. It depends if you were in captivity alone or in a group.

        "Content": "Italy's anti-mafia police are investigating after a car belonging to a leading journalist exploded outside his house. The blast took place on Thursday and targeted Sigfrido Ranucci, the lead anchor of Report, which is broadcast by state-run RAI. The bomb, which was so powerful it reportedly could have killed anyone walking by, destroyed his car, damaged another family car that was next to it and mangled the gates of his home in Pomezia, a town south of Rome. The explosion came on the eighth anniversary of the murder of Caruana Galizia, a Maltese journalist killed by a car bomb after writing extensively about suspected corruption in political and business circles. Mr Ranucci had recently returned to his house when the blast took place while his daughter had walked past the car half an hour before, Report said in a statement. The programme said firefighters, forensic crews and magistrates from Rome's anti-mafia police division were looking into the explosion. Italian prime minister Giorgia Meloni expressed her solidarity with Mr Ranucci and condemned \"the serious act of intimidation he has suffered\". \n                  Shaine March: Convicted killer admits to stabbing pregnant girlfriend to death\n                 \n                  Police offer Â£20,000 reward to find teacher's killer after 30 years\n                 \n                  Murderer jailed for attacking Glasgow man with 'napalm cocktail' before stabbing him in heart\n                 She said: \"Freedom and independence of information are essential values of our democracies, which we will continue to defend.\" Speaking outside RAI's offices, Mr Ranucci said the bombing would not stop his colleagues' work because they were used to reporting under difficult conditions. He said: \"Whoever thinks they can condition the work of Report by doing something like this will get the opposite effect. The only thing this does is maybe makes us waste some time.\" The explosion was an \"escalation\" of two years of threats directed against him, Mr Ranucci claimed. In comments published by Report, he added: \"There have certainly been a series of incidents of intimidation, which I have always reported. There is definitely a general climate of isolation and delegitimisation toward me and the entire editorial staff of Report from an editorial point of view.\" Read more on Sky News:Hamas battles for control of GazaUS strikes 'drug trafficker' boat'Historic blow' to Italian mafia He said the attack was likely related to Report's investigations into links between powerful mafia groups including the Cosa Nostra and the 'Ndrangheta, far-right crime groups and previous high-profile killings. Mr Ranucci, who has been sued multiple times for defamation, has been living under police protection for years. The International Federation of Journalists said: \"We strongly condemn the attempted murder of a journalist, which constitutes a direct assault on media freedom, and urgently call for a thorough investigation to ensure that the perpetrators are identified and brought to justice.\""

It comes after several local media outlets in Spain reported that Mr Andic's death was being investigated as a possible homicide. The billionaire founder of the fashion chain reportedly slipped and fell from a 150-metre cliff while hiking in the Monserrat caves, near Barcelona, last December. La Vanguardia newspaper reported late on Thursday that one element the judge looking into Mr Andic's death was investigating was contradictory statements Mr Andic's son Jonathan gave as a witness, and that authorities were searching his phone for more evidence. However, the newspaper reported that, during the 10-month probe, investigators had not found any conclusive evidence linking Jonathan to his father's death. Barcelona court's press office said on Friday that the case, which is still sealed, wasn't directed at any particular individual. The Andic family said it expected Jonathan to be proven innocent.

        "Content": " American forces have struck a vessel in the Caribbean suspected of carrying drugs, leaving some survivors, according to reports. The case, disclosed by a US official to the Reuters news agency, is believed to be the first such attack resulting in survivors since the operation began in September. At least 27 people have been killed by American forces across several strikes off Venezuela in recent weeks. They have been criticised, with some questioning whether they are a breach of international law. The country's president, Nicolas Maduro, has accused the US of trying to oust him. It's not known whether forces helped the survivors in Thursday's reported strike and if they are in custody. The Pentagon, which has labelled those it targeted in the strikes as narcoterrorists, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Why is the US attacking boats? Donald Trump's administration has said it considers alleged drug traffickers as unlawful combatants who must be met with military force. US officials argue lethal strikes are necessary because traditional efforts to detain crew members and seize cargoes have historically failed to stem the flow of narcotics into America. Videos of previous US attacks showed vessels being completely destroyed, and there have been no prior accounts of survivors afterwards. The strikes come against the backdrop of a US military buildup in the Caribbean which includes guided missile destroyers, F-35 fighter jets, a nuclear submarine and around 6,500 troops as Mr Trump escalates a stand-off with the Venezuelan government. On Wednesday, he confirmed he had authorised the CIA to conduct covert operations inside Venezuela, adding to speculation in Caracas that the US is attempting to topple Mr Maduro. Mr Maduro has been accused by the US of having links to drug trafficking and criminal groups, something he strongly denies.  On Thursday, Venezuela's ambassador to the UN, Samuel Moncada, condemned a recent US strike on a small boat in Caribbean waters that killed six people, calling it \"a new set of extrajudicial executions\". He called on the UN Security Council to investigate the five lethal attacks and 27 reported deaths since September. Mr Moncada also referenced two fishermen from Trinidad and Tobago, believed to have been killed in a strike on Tuesday. Speaking at the UN, he held up a copy of The Trinidad and Tobago Guardian, which reported on the story. Only a couple of miles separate Venezuela and neighbouring Trinidad and Tobago at their closest point. Meanwhile, Trinidad and Tobago's Prime Minister Kamla Persad-Bissessar has praised the first strike on a boat suspected of carrying drugs in the southern Caribbean and said all traffickers should be killed \"violently\". Read more from Sky News:Who is Venezuela's opposition leader?Venezuela closing Norwegian embassyBounty rises for Maduro's arrest The Trump administration has provided little information about the strikes, the identities of those killed, or details about the cargoes. Some former military lawyers say the legal explanations for killing suspected drug traffickers at sea, instead of apprehending them, fail to satisfy requirements under the law of war. The Pentagon has framed the strikes as \"a non-international armed conflict\" with drug cartels and insists they are legitimate."

The King and Queen will meet the new pontiff Pope Leo XIV at the Apostolic Palace, his official residence, next Thursday during their trip to Vatican City. In a highly significant moment in relations between the Catholic Church and Church of England, of which His Majesty is Supreme Governor, the King and Queen and the Pope will attend a special ecumenical service in the Sistine Chapel celebrating the ongoing work towards unity and cooperation among different Christian churches. The decision for the King and Pope to pray together during the service will be the first time a monarch and the pontiff have joined together in this type of moment of reflection in the 500 years since the Reformation when, in 1534, King Henry VIII declared himself as head of the Church of England and broke from the papal authority of the Rome Catholic Church.  In another historic step, the King will be made \"Royal Confrater\" of the Abbey of St Paul's Outside the Walls. The abbot of the community and the archpriest of the basilica wished to confer the title and received the Pope's approval to do so. To mark the occasion a special seat has been made decorated with the King's coat of arms. Read more:King Charles pays tribute to Pope FrancisKing and Queen meet Pope Francis at the Vatican The King will use it during the service, after which it will remain in the apse of the basilica for future use by His Majesty and his heirs and successors. English Kings had a particular link with The Papal Basilica of St Paul's Outside the Walls until the Reformation. It is also known as the Papal Basilica where reconciliation, ecumenism and relationships across the Christian faith are celebrated.  A spokesperson for the Church of England said: \"The royal confrater title, whilst it confers no duties or obligations on the King, and makes no changes whatsoever to the formal, constitutional and ecclesiastical position of His Majesty as the Supreme Governor of the Church of England, it is a tribute to his majesty and his own work over many decades to find common ground between faiths and to bring people together.\" The trip comes during the Catholic Church's 2025 Jubilee year. Held traditionally every 25 years, \"Pilgrims of Hope\" is the theme of this jubilee. The visit will also reflect the joint commitment from both Pope Leo and the King to protect nature and their shared concern for the environment. The service at the Sistine Chapel will have the theme of \"Care for Creation\" and they will attend a meeting on sustainability. A spokesperson from the Foreign Office said: \"At a time of growing instability and conflict, the UK's relationship with the Holy See is more important than ever. The Holy See is a key international actor. \"We work with the Holy See to promote human dignity, to promote peace and combat climate change... so His Majesty's visit will strengthen the UK's relationship with this crucial and influential global partner.\" Read more on Sky News:Vatican must do more to help sexual abuse victimsPope Leo's revealing birthday interview Only in 1961 did Queen Elizabeth II became the first British monarch since the Reformation to make an official visit to the Holy See.

We count on the United States' pressure.\" In a roundtable with journalists following the meeting, Mr Trump confirmed that hitting targets deep inside Russian territory would be an \"escalation\". He also said he was hesitant to tap into the US' supply of Tomahawks, saying: \"I have an obligation also to make sure that we're completely stocked up as a country, because you never know what's going to happen in war and peace. \"We'd much rather have them not need Tomahawks.

Trump also spoke about \"bad blood on both sides\", again inferring equal blame on Zelenskyy, whose sovereign nation was invaded, and Putin, who is doing the invading. It's in Putin's gift to stop the fighting immediately, but that was glossed over. \n                  Hungary convenient for next Putin-Trump summit - but getting there might not be so straightforward\n                 \n                  Who are the Trump critics that could face decades behind bars after being indicted?\n                 \n                  Trump and Putin: Friends reunited?\n                 Zelenskyy, clearly contorted by a need to put the record straight but not anger the famously mercurial man on the other side of the table, fired back that it is the Ukrainians who are committed to a ceasefire, a trilateral meeting and ultimately, an end to this war. Ukraine war: Zelenskyy proposes 'drone for Tomahawk' deal Relations between Zelenskyy and Trump have, obviously, improved from February when the Ukrainian president was berated and left the White House early. On that occasion, he was mocked for wearing a T-shirt and so, the next two visits, he has sported an all black suit. He has also learned that Trump responds to flattery and, accordingly, he peppered the president with compliments. He credited him with \"managing the ceasefire in the Middle East\", and said he believes he has a \"chance\" to do the same in Ukraine. Trump came into the meeting buoyed by the diplomatic success of the past fortnight in the Middle East, intoxicated by the praise he has received from all sides for brokering the hostage deal. But the war, he said he could solve in 24 hours, is proving a tougher nut to crack, and he's growing frustrated with everyone involved. That much could be gleaned from his Truth Social post after the meeting, which implored Putin and Zelenskyy to end the war along its current lines. \"Let both claim Victory, let History decide!\" he wrote. Read more from Sky News:Zelenskyy on US 'long-range' weaponsPutin faces difficult trip to summitTrump's 'game of diplomatic chess' It was a marked shift from less than a month ago, when Trump, at that point more angered by Putin, suggested Ukraine could potentially win back all its territory. As recently as Sunday, he was threatening to send long-range Tomahawk missiles to Ukraine but he made clear after their meeting that he wouldn't be doing that right now. It's likely he will wait until at least after his trailed meeting with Putin in Budapest. ð Follow Trump100 on your podcast app ð I was in Alaska in August when Trump hosted Putin and laid out the literal and metaphorical red carpet for him. The US president went in with two aims: to broker a ceasefire and a one-on-one meeting between Putin and Zelenskyy. He left with neither and there is no public sign that Putin has shifted from his maximalist aims in Ukraine. Even by Trump's own measurement, the summit was a failure. Yet he seems determined to take the Russian president at his word, granting him first a phone call ahead of the Zelenskyy visit to Washington DC and now another meeting. Putin was first successful in getting Trump to hold off on more severe sanctions on Russia, which were crippling economically. Now he has, seemingly, played a role in persuading Trump to hold off on sending Tomahawk missiles to Ukraine. The US president was asked by a journalist whether it was possible he was being played by Putin. He admitted it was possible but said he usually comes out of these things pretty well. Time will tell."

        "Headline": "Three criminal cases have been brought against critics of the US president in the past month. Here's all you need to know.",
        "Content": "John Bolton, Donald Trump's ex-adviser, has become the latest critic of the president to be criminally indicted.Â  Mr Bolton, who has been one of Mr Trump's most vocal critics since being sacked from his first administration in 2019, is alleged to have shared sensitive information with two of his relatives to be possibly used in a book he was writing. This included notes on intelligence briefings and meetings with senior government officials and foreign leaders. His is the third case to be brought against a critic of the US president in the past month. In a statement on Truth Social last month, Mr Trump called on US attorney general Pam Bondi, who leads the department, to prosecute his political opponents. \"We can't delay any longer, it's killing our reputation and credibility. They impeached me twice, and indicted me (5 times!), OVER NOTHING. JUSTICE MUST BE SERVED, NOW!!!\" Trump wrote. Here's who has been indicted by the Trump administration - and the reasons given. James Comey, former FBI director  In September, James Comey, who served as FBI director from 2013 to 2017, was charged with obstruction of justice and making a false statement to Congress. Mr Comey was fired months into Mr Trump's first presidency, in the middle of an investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election. The criminal case against Mr Comey does not concern the substance of the Russia investigation, but instead accuses him of having lied to Congress in 2020 when he said he never authorised anyone to serve as an anonymous source to a reporter about the investigation. At the beginning of October, Mr Comey pleaded not guilty to the charges. In a statement asserting his innocence, Mr Comey said: \"My family and I have known for years that there are costs to standing up to Donald Trump, but we couldn't imagine ourselves living any other way. We will not live on our knees, and you shouldn't either. Somebody that I love dearly recently said that fear is the tool of a tyrant and she's right. But I'm not afraid and I hope you're not either.\" He added: \"My heart is broken for the Department of Justice, but I have great confidence in the federal judicial system, and I am innocent, so let's have a trial and keep the faith.\" A judge has scheduled the trial to begin on 5 January. If convicted, Mr Comey faces up to five years in prison. Letitia James, New York attorney general Letitia James, was charged on 9 October with one count of bank fraud and one count of making false statements to a financial institution, in connection with a home she purchased in Norfolk, Virginia, in 2020. The Democrat, who has served as attorney general in New York since 2018, has been labelled \"guilty as hell\" by Mr Trump - who has not provided evidence as yet to back up his claim. In a lengthy statement, Ms James vehemently denied any wrongdoing and described the indictment as \"nothing more than a continuation of the president's desperate weaponisation of our justice system\". During the president's first term in office, Ms James sued him and his administration dozens of times. Last year, she won a judgment against the Trump Organization after she brought a civil lawsuit alleging he and his companies defrauded banks by overstating the value of his real estate holdings on financial statements. She is scheduled to make an initial appearance in the federal court in Norfolk on 24 October. If convicted, she faces up to 30 years in prison and up to a $1m (Â£752m) fine on each count, according to Sky's US partner network NBC News. John Bolton, former Trump adviser John Bolton has been charged with eight counts of transmitting classified information, as well as 10 counts of unlawful retention of NDI, the department said. Each count is punishable by up to 10 years in prison, but any sentence would be determined by a judge.  Mr Bolton has denied any wrongdoing and said the charges were an effort by the president \"to ensure that he alone determines what is said about his conduct\". \"I look forward to the fight to defend my lawful conduct and to expose his abuse of power,\" he added. He made his first appearance at federal court in Greenbelt, Maryland on 17 October to surrender to authorities. Asked by reporters at the White House about Mr Bolton's indictment, Mr Trump called him a \"bad guy\". Who else is under investigation? A number of individuals remain under investigation by the DOJ, but are yet to be charged. Senator Adam Schiff and Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook, who are both Democrats, are being investigated for alleged mortgage fraud. The investigations are being led by Ed Martin, who was appointed by Ms Bondi as a special assistant US attorney to help with mortgage fraud investigations involving public officials. Both Mr Schiff and Ms Cook have denied any wrongdoing. In June, Mr Trump ordered the DOJ to investigate Miles Taylor and Chris Krebs, two former homeland security officials who served in the first Trump administration. Mr Taylor, who confessed to authoring an anonymous 2018 op-ed which was sharply critical of the president, has fought back against the investigation into his government service, calling on government watchdogs to investigate if the order came from Mr Trump. While Mr Krebs, who is a former top cybersecurity official, said the order targeting him sets a \"scary precedent\". He said that is why he has decided to call on the inspectors general to investigate."

Supporters of the Israeli side have been told they are not allowed to attend November's game in Birmingham after a decision by Birmingham's Safety Advisory Group (SAG). The group - made up of local stakeholders, including representatives from the council, police and event organisers - said the decision was due to a high risk of violence based on \"current intelligence and previous incidents\". Politics live: MPs react to Maccabi Tel Aviv fan ban The decision has been criticised across the political spectrum, with Sir Keir Starmer describing it as a \"wrong decision\" while Tory opposition leader Kemi Badenoch called it a \"national disgrace\". In a statement on Friday night, a government spokesperson said: \"No one should be stopped from watching a football game simply because of who they are. \"The government is working with policing and other partners to do everything in our power to ensure this game can safely go ahead, with all fans present. \"We are exploring what additional resources and support are required so all fans can attend.\"  Meanwhile, Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood said: \"Antisemitism is a stain on our society that shames us all. Every football fan, whoever they are, should be able to watch their team in safety. \"This government is doing everything in our power to ensure all fans can safely attend the game.\" The prime minister's spokesman previously said Sir Keir would \"do everything in his power to give Jewish communities the security they deserve\". Read more:Why are fans banned - and has this happened before?How this raises questions about one of the UK's biggest cities  The Home Office offered to provide more police for the event, while Culture Secretary Lisa Nandy and Communities Secretary Steve Reed also intervened. However, senior police insisted the ban was necessary and cited clashes and hate crime offences committed when the Israeli team travelled to Amsterdam to play Ajax last year. The Aston Villa vs Maccabi Tel Aviv match - set to take place on Thursday 6 November - is a Europa League fixture. UEFA, which runs the tournament, had urged UK authorities to ensure away fans could attend."

        "Content": "A \"game-changing\" HIV-prevention treatment is set to be approved for use in England and Wales. Cabotegravir (CAB-LA) is an injection administered every two months to reduce the risk of infection in HIV-negative adults and young people, offering an alternative to the daily pills that are used. The tablets, known as PrEP (pre-exposure prophylaxis), cannot be taken by some of those at risk because of medical or other reasons. The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (Nice) recommended CAB-LA for use in draft guidance published on Friday. CAB-LA is the first injectable PrEP option and the first PrEP medicine that Nice has approved. It is expected to be available around three months after Nice publishes its final guidance later this year. Health Secretary Wes Streeting said the approval of the injection was \"game-changing\". For vulnerable people unable to take other methods of HIV prevention, the injection \"represents hope\", he said. He added: \"We're making real progress on HIV, with PrEP use up by 8% this year, and our ambition goes even further. \"England will be the first country to end HIV transmissions by 2030, and this breakthrough treatment is another powerful tool in our arsenal to reach that crucial goal.\"  More than 111,000 people accessed PrEP in sexual health clinics in England last year, according to the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA), a 7% increase on the previous year.

The regulator said the failure to disclose that the 13-year-old boy narrating the programme was the son of a deputy minister in the Hamas-run government broke the rules and that it was \"materially misleading\" not to mention it. In July, the BBC said it breached its own editorial guidelines by failing to disclose the full identity of the child narrator's father in the Gaza: How To Survive A Warzone documentary. The documentary was made by independent production company Hoyo Films, and features 13-year-old Abdullah Alyazouri, who speaks about life in Gaza during the war between Israel and Hamas. It was pulled from BBC iPlayer in February after it emerged that the boy was the son of Ayman Alyazouri, who has worked as Hamas's deputy minister of agriculture. A BBC review into the controversial programme said three members of the independent production company knew about the role of the boy's father - but no one within the BBC was aware. Ofcom's investigation into the documentary, which followed 20 complaints, found that the audience was deprived of \"critical information\" which could have been \"highly relevant\" to their assessment of the narrator and the information he provided. \n                  Bob Vylan: BBC partly upholds complaints over Glastonbury set\n                 \n                  Gary Lineker ends Ant and Dec winning streak at National Television Awards months after antisemitism row\n                 \n                  'We may see more things coming out': BBC chief quizzed by MPs about talent 'scandal'\n                 The report said the failure to disclose a narrator's links to Hamas \"had the potential to erode the very high levels of trust that audiences would have expected in a BBC factual programme about the Israel-Gaza war\".  Following its internal review into the programme, and a full fact-finding review the BBC's director of Editorial Complaints and Reviews, Peter Johnston, the corporation's director general, Tim Davie, and Hoyo Films apologised. Hoyo films said it was \"working closely with the BBC\" to see if it could find a way to bring back parts of the documentary to iPlayer, adding: \"Our team in Gaza risked their lives to document the devastating impact of war on children. \"Gaza: How To Survive A Warzone remains a vital account, and our contributors - who have no say in the conflict - deserve to have their voices heard.\" Israel does not allow international news organisations into Gaza to report independently. ð Listen to Sky News Daily on your podcast app ð Describing it as \"a serious breach\" of its rules,\" Ofcom said they were directing the BBC to broadcast a statement of their findings against it on BBC2 at 9pm, with a date yet to be confirmed.
