        "Content": " Donald Trump has said the US is close to agreeing a minerals deal with Ukraine - after accusing Britain and France of \"doing nothing\" to end the war. \"We're signing an agreement, hopefully in the next fairly short period of time,\" the president told reporters in the Oval Office. President Volodymyr Zelenskyy also said on Friday the two countries were \"working on a draft agreement\". His comments came after a conversation between his chief of staff and US national security adviser Mike Waltz on a minerals deal the Ukrainian leader had previously turned down. \"Here's the bottom line, President Zelenskyy is going to sign that deal, and you will see that in the very short term,\" Mr Waltz told the Conservative Political Action Conference in Maryland. It is also believed that US negotiators raised the possibility of cutting Ukraine's access to Elon Musk's vital Starlink satellite internet system if it did not agree to a deal. Earlier, Mr Trump called French President Emmanuel Macron a \"friend of mine\" and UK leader Sir Keir Starmer a \"nice guy\" but said Russia had only agreed to negotiate \"because of me\". Mr Trump made the comments days before both leaders visit the White House for a meeting in which they must try to press Ukraine's case while keeping the US leader onside. The president also continued his criticism of Mr Zelenskyy, saying he had \"no cards\" to play. \"I've been watching for years, and I've been watching him negotiate with no cards. He has no cards. And you get sick of it. You just get sick of it. And I've had it,\" he told a Fox radio show. The comments come after he recently called the Ukrainian leader a \"dictator without elections\" - apparently in response to Mr Zelenskyy saying his US counterpart was living in a \"disinformation space\" after Mr Trump claimed Ukraine had started the war.  Ukraine was also excluded from talks between the top US and Russian diplomats in Riyadh earlier this week. They were intended to set the stage for future negotiations on ending the war, which started when Russia launched a full-scale invasion three years ago. Speaking on Friday evening, Mr Trump denied speculation he could visit Moscow for talks on 9 May - the day Russia celebrates its victory over the Nazis. Mr Trump also told reporters the Russian and Ukrainian leaders needed to \"work together\" to end the war. However, the US has already dealt a huge blow to Kyiv's position in any future talks. US defence secretary Pete Hegseth said last week that a return to pre-war borders was \"unrealistic\" and ruled out NATO membership as a way to guarantee Kyiv's security.

Ukraine's leader held talks with US envoy Keith Kellogg in Kyiv on Thursday, describing it later as a \"good discussion\".  Mr Kellogg struck a markedly different tone to President Trump when he called Mr Zelenskyy the \"courageous leader of a nation at war\". However, there are concerns over how much influence Mr Kellogg has, with a Ukrainian source saying there was a sense he had been sidelined."

        "Content": "Hamas says the body of hostage Shiri Bibas has now been handed over, according to the group's Al-Aqsa TV channel - as the Israeli military says it is checking the reports. Israel said on Thursday that Ms Bibas was not among the four bodies handed over on Thursday as part of the ceasefire agreement, instead receiving an \"anonymous body without identification\". The failure to hand over the correct body caused outrage in Israel, and prompted Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to vow that Hamas \"pays the full price for this cruel and evil violation\". Follow latest: Israel claims Hamas killed child hostages with their 'bare hands' In a short statement, the Red Cross confirmed it had received human remains and transferred them to Israeli authorities. The statement did not specify whose remains were believed to be in transit. Dr Salem Attalah, deputy secretary general for the Palestinian Mujahedeen Brigades, said it handed over Ms Bibas' remains to the Red Cross. The militant group is thought to have been holding the mother and her two boys, Kfir and Ariel. Hamas previously claimed there was the \"possibility of an error or overlap in the bodies\" which may have been caused by Israel \"targeting and bombing the place where the family was with other Palestinians\".  Basem Naim, a member of the Hamas political bureau, later said \"unfortunate mistakes\" occurred and also suggested Israeli bombing had mixed the bodies of Israeli hostages and Palestinians. He added in a statement: \"We confirm that it is not in our values or our interest to keep any bodies or not to abide by the covenants and agreements that we sign.\" In a statement, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said: \"Following the reports regarding Shiri Bibas, they are currently under review. IDF representatives are in contact with the family.\" Ms Bibas was kidnapped with her sons - four-year-old Ariel, and nine-month-old Kfir - from the Niz Or kibbutz during the group's terror attack on Israel in October 2023.

However, it claimed the children had been murdered by Hamas with \"bare hands\". Hamas however claimed Ms Bibas and her children were all killed in an Israeli airstrike in November 2023, near the start of the war. It comes ahead of the next round of hostage releases on Saturday - the final one during the first six-week phase of the ceasefire agreement, which came into effect last month. The hostages due for release are Eliya Cohen, Omer Shem Tov, Tal Shoham, Omer Wenkert, Hisham al Sayed and Avera Mengisto. According to the Hamas prisoners' media office, Israel will be releasing 602 Palestinian prisoners and detainees on Saturday, adding to the hundreds already released. It also comes after Israeli defence minister Israel Katz instructed the IDF to intensify operations in the West Bank after a series of bus explosions in a city near Tel Aviv. Two of the blasts were in the city of Bat Yam on Thursday night, and a third was reported in the nearby town of Holon. No injuries were reported."

The judge set a deadline of 9 April to submit pre-trial motions. In addition to the New York cases, Mr Mangione also faces charges of forgery, carrying firearms without a licence, and other counts in Pennsylvania, where authorities arrested him at a McDonald's. Police say he was in possession of a gun, bullets, multiple fake IDs and a handwritten document that expressed \"ill will\" towards corporate America. He is being held in a Brooklyn jail alongside several other high-profile defendants, including music mogul and rapper Sean \"Diddy\" Combs, and disgraced crypto entrepreneur Sam Bankman-Fried. The killing prompted some to voice their resentment at US health insurers, with Mangione attracting a cult following. A poll taken in the wake of the shooting showed most Americans believe health insurance profits and coverage denials were partly to blame for the incident."

        "Content": "\n          Science and Technology reporter\n        Apple will no longer offer customers in the UK its most advanced, end-to-end security encryption feature for cloud data storage - following a row with the government. The Advanced Data Protection (ADP) tool is an optional feature which means only account holders can see things like photos or documents that they have stored online. Apple itself does not have access to the data. However, the UK government reportedly requested the right to see the data earlier this month. In response, Apple has removed the tool from use in the UK. The company is switching it off as an option for those not already using it, and will introduce a process to move existing users away from it. Security officials argue that encryption hinders criminal investigations, while tech firms defend it as essential to user privacy. The loss of end-to-end encryption for iCloud backup means Apple would be able in some instances to read user data such as iMessages that would otherwise be protected and pass it on to authorities if legally compelled. \n                  Apple removes end-to-end security encryption tool for UK cloud users rather than renege on its privacy commitments to all\n                 \n                  TikTok returns to major US app stores after Trump reassures tech giants\n                 \n                  Apple ordered by UK government to let it access users' encrypted data - reports\n                 However, if a user has end-to-end encryption, Apple cannot read the data under any circumstances. What has Apple said? \"We are gravely disappointed that the protections provided by ADP will not be available to our customers in the UK given the continuing rise of data breaches and other threats to customer privacy,\" Apple said in a statement. \"Enhancing the security of cloud storage with end-to-end encryption is more urgent than ever before. \"Apple remains committed to offering our users the highest level of security for their personal data and are hopeful that we will be able to do so in the future in the United Kingdom.\" Business and economics correspondent Apple's decision to withdraw its most secure cloud storage service from the UK is just the latest turning point in a battle that has been rumbling on between US tech companies and successive British governments for some time. The dispute centres on end-to-end encryption, a method of secure communication which enables only the sender and receiver to view messages. Ministers have long argued that the technology, in its current form, is preventing law enforcement agencies from catching criminals, including terrorists and paedophiles. However, Apple along with its fellow tech companies say they are not prepared to dilute the privacy commitments they have made to all their customers to meet their demands. Whitehall has been trying to tackle this issue for some time. Read Gurpreet's full analysis here Read more science and technology news:How AI is being used to manipulate German votersNew prostate cancer screening trial announcedDonated placenta saved acid attack victim's eye Apple customers who already had the data protection tool turned on \"will eventually need to disable this security feature\", said the company. It is already unavailable for customers who weren't using the feature, who now see a message that reads: \"Apple can no longer offer Advanced Data Protection (ADP) in the United Kingdom to new users.\" What has the UK government said? The government said it will not confirm or deny whether it requested a Technical Capability Notice (TCN), which is what would give it the right to see the encrypted data. \"We do not comment on operational matters, including for example confirming or denying the existence of any such notices,\" a Home Office spokesperson told Sky News. According to a Home Office source, however, even if a TCN was issued, it wouldn't give the government blanket access to people's data. Separate authorisations or warrants would still be required. What's the reaction from the tech industry? Many in the tech industry are shocked by Apple's move, with Graeme Stewart from cybersecurity company Check Point saying it \"is effectively smashing open Pandora's box and hoping the chaos stays neatly inside\". \"At its heart, encryption isn't just for criminals; it's a shield for millions of law-abiding citizens, businesses, and critical infrastructure,\" he said. \"Now we are prying open that door to our digital Fort Knox, there's no telling what else might slip through.\" Apple was also described as \"calling the government's bluff\" by technology partner at Keystone Law, Robert Peake, for refusing to create a backdoor into its protected data. \"The government will face increasing pressure to back down on this, as it seriously undermines its recent attempts to portray the UK as a pro-innovation place to operate,\" he said."

        "Content": " A man has been found guilty of attempted murder for attacking author Sir Salman Rushdie. The 77-year-old British-American writer was stabbed multiple times as he was preparing to give a speech in New York in 2022. He was blinded in his right eye in the incident, suffered a severely damaged hand, and spent months recovering. Following a trial in Chautauqua County Court, a jury convicted 27-year-old Hadi Matar of attempting to murder Sir Salman, after less than two hours of deliberations. He was also found guilty of assault for wounding Henry Reese, who was on stage with Sir Salman at the time. Matar gave no obvious reaction to the verdict, and quietly muttered \"free Palestine\" as he was led out of the courtroom in handcuffs. The court heard Matar ran on to the stage at the Chautauqua Institution where the author was about to speak on 12 August 2022, and stabbed him in front of an audience. The Indian-born writer, who spent most of the 1990s in hiding in the UK after receiving death threats over his 1988 novel The Satanic Verses, was stabbed about 15 times. Sir Salman was attacked in the head, neck, torso, and left hand. He also suffered damage to his liver and intestines.

        "Content": " A man has been found guilty of attempted murder for attacking author Sir Salman Rushdie. The 77-year-old British-American writer was stabbed multiple times as he was preparing to give a speech in New York in 2022. He was blinded in his right eye in the incident, suffered a severely damaged hand, and spent months recovering. Following a trial in Chautauqua County Court, a jury convicted 27-year-old Hadi Matar of attempting to murder Sir Salman, after less than two hours of deliberations. He was also found guilty of assault for wounding Henry Reese, who was on stage with Sir Salman at the time. Matar gave no obvious reaction to the verdict, and quietly muttered \"free Palestine\" as he was led out of the courtroom in handcuffs. The court heard Matar ran on to the stage at the Chautauqua Institution where the author was about to speak on 12 August 2022, and stabbed him in front of an audience. The Indian-born writer, who spent most of the 1990s in hiding in the UK after receiving death threats over his 1988 novel The Satanic Verses, was stabbed about 15 times. Sir Salman was attacked in the head, neck, torso, and left hand. He also suffered damage to his liver and intestines.  'I was dying' During the trial, Sir Salman described the moment Matar attacked him and told the court: \"I only saw him at the last minute. \"I was aware of someone wearing black clothes, or dark clothes and a black face mask.

One passenger on the P&O Iona told Sky News \"people have been dropping like flies\", with \"a large number\" of guests and staff experiencing symptoms. \"People [were] throwing up in restaurants, on decks, outside cabins,\" the passenger said. The P&O Iona, which can carry more than 5,000 passengers and 1,800 staff, is currently on a seven-day cruise across northern Europe, visiting Hamburg, Rotterdam and Zeebrugge. The current passenger numbers are unclear. P&O Cruises has confirmed to Sky News some of its guests \"have unfortunately reported gastrointestinal symptoms,\" however, they said it is currently affecting fewer than 1% of the passengers on board. A large number of families are understood to be on the cruise, which is taking place during the half-term break. It left Southampton on 15 February. The captain of the ship is understood to have made a public announcement on Thursday informing passengers of the outbreak, and said that staff were doing their best to stop the spread of infection. \n                  P&O spent £47m sacking and replacing 786 mainly British seafarers in 2022\n                 \n                  Why P&O Ferries' pariah status may never change\n                 \n                  P&O Ferries owner has 'turned a corner' since 800 staff sacked, minister says as £1bn investment to go ahead\n                 Some passengers who are isolating have said staff shortages have resulted in problems with having food delivered, as well as receiving new towels and bed linen.

They also said medication is \"readily available through our onboard medical centre\" and an emergency support number is available 24 hours a day. \"We are aware that some guests have unfortunately reported gastrointestinal symptoms recently on board Iona's Northern Europe cruise,\" P&O Cruises said in a statement. \"Gastrointestinal-related illnesses are very common in the UK and are predominantly spread by person-to-person transmission in environments such as hotels, schools and restaurants. \"P&O Cruises works with global, national and regional public health authorities on approved and proven protocols across our ships in order to protect the health and wellbeing of all on board.\""

        "Content": " Jess Phillips has said \"there is no place\" where violence against women and girls \"doesn't happen\" - as a new law is set to make spiking a criminal offence. Earlier on Friday, the government said spiking will now be its own offence with a possible 10-year prison sentence as part of the Crime and Policing Bill, which will be introduced in parliament next week. It also announced a nationwide training programme to help workers spot and prevent attacks. Speaking to Sky News correspondent Ashna Hurynag, the safeguarding minister said that while spiking is already illegal under existing laws, the new classification will simplify reporting the act for victims. \"Spiking is illegal - that isn't in question, but what victims and campaigners who have tried to use the legislation as it currently is have told us is that it's unclear,\" Ms Phillips said. UK 'was never safe' for women When asked if the UK is becoming a less safe place for women, the minister for safeguarding and violence against women and girls, said: \"I don't think it's becoming less safe, if I'm being honest. I think it was never safe.\" Speaking about a rise in coverage, Ms Phillips said: \"We have a real opportunity to use that, the sense of feeling [built by campaigners] in the country, to really push forward political change in this space.\" \"The reality is that it doesn't matter whether it's the House of Commons or any pub in your local high street - there is no place where violence against women and girls doesn't happen, I'm afraid,\" she added.

        "Content": "\n          Science and Technology reporter\n        Apple will no longer offer customers in the UK its most advanced, end-to-end security encryption feature for cloud data storage - following a row with the government. The Advanced Data Protection (ADP) tool is an optional feature which means only account holders can see things like photos or documents that they have stored online. Apple itself does not have access to the data. However, the UK government reportedly requested the right to see the data earlier this month. In response, Apple has removed the tool from use in the UK. The company is switching it off as an option for those not already using it, and will introduce a process to move existing users away from it. Security officials argue that encryption hinders criminal investigations, while tech firms defend it as essential to user privacy. The loss of end-to-end encryption for iCloud backup means Apple would be able in some instances to read user data such as iMessages that would otherwise be protected and pass it on to authorities if legally compelled. \n                  Apple removes end-to-end security encryption tool for UK cloud users rather than renege on its privacy commitments to all\n                 \n                  TikTok returns to major US app stores after Trump reassures tech giants\n                 \n                  Apple ordered by UK government to let it access users' encrypted data - reports\n                 However, if a user has end-to-end encryption, Apple cannot read the data under any circumstances. What has Apple said? \"We are gravely disappointed that the protections provided by ADP will not be available to our customers in the UK given the continuing rise of data breaches and other threats to customer privacy,\" Apple said in a statement. \"Enhancing the security of cloud storage with end-to-end encryption is more urgent than ever before. \"Apple remains committed to offering our users the highest level of security for their personal data and are hopeful that we will be able to do so in the future in the United Kingdom.\" Business and economics correspondent Apple's decision to withdraw its most secure cloud storage service from the UK is just the latest turning point in a battle that has been rumbling on between US tech companies and successive British governments for some time. The dispute centres on end-to-end encryption, a method of secure communication which enables only the sender and receiver to view messages. Ministers have long argued that the technology, in its current form, is preventing law enforcement agencies from catching criminals, including terrorists and paedophiles. However, Apple along with its fellow tech companies say they are not prepared to dilute the privacy commitments they have made to all their customers to meet their demands.

It is already unavailable for customers who weren't using the feature, who now see a message that reads: \"Apple can no longer offer Advanced Data Protection (ADP) in the United Kingdom to new users.\" What has the UK government said? The government said it will not confirm or deny whether it requested a Technical Capability Notice (TCN), which is what would give it the right to see the encrypted data. \"We do not comment on operational matters, including for example confirming or denying the existence of any such notices,\" a Home Office spokesperson told Sky News. According to a Home Office source, however, even if a TCN was issued, it wouldn't give the government blanket access to people's data. Separate authorisations or warrants would still be required. What's the reaction from the tech industry? Many in the tech industry are shocked by Apple's move, with Graeme Stewart from cybersecurity company Check Point saying it \"is effectively smashing open Pandora's box and hoping the chaos stays neatly inside\". \"At its heart, encryption isn't just for criminals; it's a shield for millions of law-abiding citizens, businesses, and critical infrastructure,\" he said. \"Now we are prying open that door to our digital Fort Knox, there's no telling what else might slip through.\" Apple was also described as \"calling the government's bluff\" by technology partner at Keystone Law, Robert Peake, for refusing to create a backdoor into its protected data. \"The government will face increasing pressure to back down on this, as it seriously undermines its recent attempts to portray the UK as a pro-innovation place to operate,\" he said."

The dispute centres on end-to-end encryption, a method of secure communication which enables only the sender and receiver to view messages. Ministers have long argued that the technology, in its current form, is preventing law enforcement agencies from catching criminals, including terrorists and paedophiles. However, Apple along with its fellow tech companies say they are not prepared to dilute the privacy commitments they have made to all their customers to meet their demands. Whitehall has been trying to tackle this issue for some time. Under the Online Safety Act 2023, it attempted to introduce client-side scanning. This would have forced tech companies to scan private messages before they were encrypted. Meta's WhatsApp and Signal threatened to exit the UK market in response, with the latter saying it would \"100% walk\". The government later rowed back. \n                  Apple removes advanced security tool over UK government row\n                 \n                  TikTok returns to major US app stores after Trump reassures tech giants\n                 \n                  Apple ordered by UK government to let it access users' encrypted data - reports\n                 'Snoopers charter' Now it has used the Investigatory Powers Act (IPA), the so-called 'snoopers charter', to try to force Apple to allow security authorities access to encrypted cloud data, which Apple itself does not view. Rather than create a backdoor for the government, the tech giant said it would disable Advanced Data Protection (ADP) in the UK altogether. This is its most advanced, end-to-end security encryption tool for the cloud. When using ADP, only account holders can see photos and other documents they have stored on the cloud. Apple users in UK lose extra security layer It means Apple is now complying with the law, and in that sense the government has got what it wanted, but it means users in the UK have lost the additional layer of security. The government believes the approach is necessary. In 2023, the Home Office published guidance, which stated that offences relating to online indecent images of children had increased by 13% over the previous year. It pointed to a YouGov poll, which suggested that the public support the view that tech companies should develop technology that allows them to identify child sexual abuse in end-to-end encrypted messaging apps. However, tech companies and security experts say a 'backdoor' isn't possible without undermining security and privacy for all users. Experts have been trying to develop one for the past 30 years, with little success. Some campaigners back tech firms It's not just tech companies who are fighting this corner. When reports of this latest effort first emerged last week, 109 civil society organisations, companies, and cybersecurity experts, published a joint letter to the home secretary Yvette Cooper, which said the demand \"jeopardises the security and privacy of millions, undermines the UK tech sector, and sets a dangerous precedent for global cybersecurity\". Campaigners also argue that the move could threaten global privacy rights. Human Rights Watch has described it as a disproportionate and an \"alarming overreach\".

Access to device backups is access to your entire phone, and strong encryption to prevent this access should be the norm by default.\" In the US, senator Ron Wyden and congressman Andy Biggs condemned the plan, calling it \"dangerous\" and \"short-sighted\". That being said, the US government has previously asked Apple to break its encryption to help with its criminal investigations, with little success. Apple can appeal the decision but, in taking on major US tech companies, the UK government has a huge fight on its hands."

The three also preyed on vulnerable and underage girls at a flat above their family's takeaway in Barrow, Cumbria, between 2008 and 2010. They gave them cigarettes, alcohol, food and even hair extensions in what barrister Tim Evans KC called a \"classic grooming technique\". He said the brothers worked as a team and \"created an environment in Barrow in which each of them could abuse young girls\". Judge Unsworth KC said they had shattered the lives of their victims and hid in plain sight in the town. Multiple schoolgirls in their uniforms were regularly seen at the takeaway, the judge said, with Jai acting ruthlessly to stop them going to the police. Death threat In 2009, one girl was grabbed off the street by her hair and shoved in a van after speaking to officers. The Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) said Jai was in the passenger seat and the man who grabbed her warned \"she would be dead\" if she'd said anything. Jai told the girl he would do anything to protect his family and she didn't know what he was capable of, the CPS added. He also threatened a woman who was due to be interviewed by police in 2010, causing her to back out. The court also heard Sarj would take one of the girls to a hotel for sex about twice a month and became increasingly controlling - to the point she remains on medication and is terrified of seeing him in the street.

Shaha Alman Miah was found guilty of three counts of sexual activity with a child. Shah Joman Miah was convicted of sexually abusing three children. There were nine counts of rape of a child among his 40 offences."

        "Content": "A mother has been found guilty of murdering her two young sons at their home in Dagenham, east London. The bodies of Elijah Thomas, two, and Marley Thomas, five, were found by their father in December 2022. Kara Alexander, 47, who denied two counts of murder, was found guilty at Kingston Crown Court on Friday, a court official said. Post-mortems found the boys had either drowned or suffocated, the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) said. Alexander had claimed the children had drowned in the bath while she was asleep. Prosecutors said they built their case on showing they could not have accidentally drowned and that the only reasonable explanation for their deaths was that Alexander caused them to drown. The boys' father was due to have them that weekend and became increasingly concerned when he had not heard back from Alexander, the court heard. \n                  Plans for direct trains from London to Germany and Switzerland\n                 \n                  'Monster' Omar Wilson found guilty of beating top chef to death near Notting Hill Carnival\n                 \n                  Oliver White: Man convicted over £1.38m robbery that 'led to store manager ending his own life'\n                 When he arrived at their home, she told him the children were upstairs sleeping. He found the boys' bodies together in the lower bunk of their shared bunk bed dressed in pyjamas, the CPS said. The ambulance service and police came to the house but there was nothing that could be done as the boys had been dead for some hours, the court heard. Samantha Yelland, a senior Crown prosecutor in the CPS London Homicide Unit, said: \"Our thoughts remain with Elijah and Marley's family and friends who have been completely devastated by their loss. \"It is unimaginable to think what those poor children went through in their final moments. \"It is a parent's job to keep their children safe and Kara Alexander not only failed to do that, but robbed them of their lives.

The guilty verdict \"cannot turn back the clock but it does provide the children's family with some form of resolution,\" he said. Alexander will be sentenced in April."

        "Content": "\n          News reporter\n              @niamhielynch\n A trade union has called for hundreds of doctors who received the wrong result in a key exam they took nearly 18 months ago to be compensated after a \"catastrophic\" and \"life-altering\" error. Some 222 doctors who had previously been told they passed the Membership of the Royal Colleges of Physicians Part 2 Written Examination have now been informed that they had failed. Another 61 doctors were told that they had failed when they had actually passed the September 2023 exam. The total number of doctors affected amounts to around one-fifth of the 1,451 candidates who sat the exam. The Federation of the Royal Colleges of Physicians has said the error is due to a \"data processing issue\". It has offered a free resit in March and a refund of examination fees. The exam is one of three that must be taken by doctors who want to continue training in a medical specialism such as cardiology, respiratory or intensive care medicine. It consists of two three-hour papers each with 100 questions. UK students must pay up to £502 to sit the exam, with this figure rising to £672 for international students. Doctors shocked and confused Katherine, who works as a doctor in the South East, is one of those whose results have been affected. Speaking to Sky News, the doctor, who is in her late 20s, said she is still in shock and very confused after being notified via email that she will have to retake the exam. \"I thought it was [spam],\" she said. \"I was waiting for a follow-up email saying: 'Sorry we sent that out in error, we want to retract it. I felt sick, it was terrible.\" She added: \"A year and a half after you think you are okay, to be told actually I'm taking this away now. I have had colleagues tell they have had nightmares about this. \"I think they [the federation] need to offer some clarity, some recognition of the damage that this could potentially cause. \"It's kind of ironic, because we get trained on how to break bad news, so it's hilarious the way they decided to approach all of this.\" Criticism from union The British Medical Association (BMA) - the trade union for doctors and medical students - said the error was \"appalling\" and \"nothing short of catastrophic\". Its deputy chair of council Dr Emma Runswick told Sky News that the federation's handling of the issue has also been \"completely atrocious\". \"It's an expensive exam and it's a hard exam. \"The failure rate is fairly high and most people do not pass it the first time. Therefore people dedicate months and months of their time and money going to study events and courses.\" Dr Runswick said the offer to resit the exam for free on 26 March is \"completely unreasonable\". She said: \"People plan their families and their lives around this and they will be in very different circumstances now. To give them six weeks to refamiliarise themselves with the format of the questions and to make sure that they have all of the material, and to offer one date - they might be on leave, on nights, they might have holiday booked, they might not have childcare. \"The response from the federation has been completely atrocious. It's not half as much time as is necessary either to prepare or to arrange your life to make sure you could take it.\" Dr Runswick said that some doctors who have contacted the BMA are \"very distressed\" and the error has had a major toll on their wellbeing. \"They don't know if they're going to lose their jobs because to be in a specialty registrar post, you have to have this [exam]. And they no longer meet the criteria. \"Are they going to get sacked? How are they going to sort out their lives for a resit in six weeks? Do they really have to resit? What was their mark in the end? How has this happened? Why has it taken 18 months? That level of distress, that life and career-altering distress, has an impact.\" Read more:Woman claiming to be Madeleine McCann charged with stalkingHow AI is influencing German votersBirkenstocks not works of art, court rules BMA chair of council Professor Philip Banfield said: \"The federation must commit to significant support and compensation for all the doctors whose lives and careers will be in turmoil today because of this mistake.\" The BMA said it has started negotiations to ensure there is no detriment to any doctors affected. Those negotiations involve organisations including the federation, the employers of those affected, the General Medical Council (GMC), and the Department of Health and Social Care along with the Scottish, Welsh and Northern Irish health departments. When questioned more on the matter by Sky News, a spokesperson for the federation said the issue was identified after a recent audit of results from both parts of the written exam. Asked if giving compensation is something they have considered, they said: \"We will only be in a position to discuss these matters publicly once we have had conversations with each doctor involved, as each situation is unique to their specific circumstances.\" They added that an \"independent review\" has been launched to determine why the issue occurred. Dozens of doctors contact BMA Around 60 doctors who have been affected have been in contact with the union so far. Both the federation and the BMA have said the error will have no effect on patient safety. Dr Mike Jones, executive medical director of the federation, said: \"On behalf of the federation, we deeply and unreservedly apologise for this situation. \"We appreciate how distressing the candidates affected will find this, and for some it will create an additional burden to the hard and vital work they do,\" he said. The GMC said: \"We know this will be a concerning and disappointing time. \"The federation informed us promptly once they had discovered the error. We are seeking assurance that our standards are being met and there are no concerns about patient safety. \"We are working closely with the federation to understand what happened, how they will support those affected, and what actions they will take to ensure this does not happen again.\" A spokesperson for the Department of Health and Social Care told Sky News: \"This is very concerning and we have asked NHS England to work with the Royal College of Physicians and the General Medical Council to ensure this issue is rectified as a matter of urgency.\""

Israel said on Thursday that Ms Bibas was not among the four bodies handed over on Thursday as part of the ceasefire agreement, instead receiving an \"anonymous body without identification\". The failure to hand over the correct body caused outrage in Israel, and prompted Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to vow that Hamas \"pays the full price for this cruel and evil violation\". Follow latest: Israel claims Hamas killed child hostages with their 'bare hands' In a short statement, the Red Cross confirmed it had received human remains and transferred them to Israeli authorities. The statement did not specify whose remains were believed to be in transit. Dr Salem Attalah, deputy secretary general for the Palestinian Mujahedeen Brigades, said it handed over Ms Bibas' remains to the Red Cross. The militant group is thought to have been holding the mother and her two boys, Kfir and Ariel. Hamas previously claimed there was the \"possibility of an error or overlap in the bodies\" which may have been caused by Israel \"targeting and bombing the place where the family was with other Palestinians\".  Basem Naim, a member of the Hamas political bureau, later said \"unfortunate mistakes\" occurred and also suggested Israeli bombing had mixed the bodies of Israeli hostages and Palestinians. He added in a statement: \"We confirm that it is not in our values or our interest to keep any bodies or not to abide by the covenants and agreements that we sign.\" In a statement, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said: \"Following the reports regarding Shiri Bibas, they are currently under review. IDF representatives are in contact with the family.\" Ms Bibas was kidnapped with her sons - four-year-old Ariel, and nine-month-old Kfir - from the Niz Or kibbutz during the group's terror attack on Israel in October 2023.

Hamas however claimed Ms Bibas and her children were all killed in an Israeli airstrike in November 2023, near the start of the war. It comes ahead of the next round of hostage releases on Saturday - the final one during the first six-week phase of the ceasefire agreement, which came into effect last month. The hostages due for release are Eliya Cohen, Omer Shem Tov, Tal Shoham, Omer Wenkert, Hisham al Sayed and Avera Mengisto. According to the Hamas prisoners' media office, Israel will be releasing 602 Palestinian prisoners and detainees on Saturday, adding to the hundreds already released. It also comes after Israeli defence minister Israel Katz instructed the IDF to intensify operations in the West Bank after a series of bus explosions in a city near Tel Aviv. Two of the blasts were in the city of Bat Yam on Thursday night, and a third was reported in the nearby town of Holon. No injuries were reported."

According to the Hamas prisoners' media office, Israel will be releasing 602 Palestinian prisoners and detainees on Saturday, adding to the hundreds already released since the ceasefire took effect last month. Saturday's hostage release will be the final one in this phase of the ceasefire agreement. Mr Mengisto and Mr al-Sayed are civilians who entered Gaza a decade ago and have been held there since. Israelis who survived being held prisoner in Gaza, where a powerful bombing campaign has left much of it destroyed, have been released in small groups since the first six-week phase began last month.

The body of journalist and peace activist Oded Lifshitz, who was 83 when he was abducted, was also returned. The Bibas family has become a powerful symbol of the 251 Israelis kidnapped on 7 October 2023 - not least because Kfir was the youngest taken. The children's father, Yarden Bibas, was released on 1 February as part of the ceasefire deal between Hamas and Israel. Since the start of the war in October 2023, the Hamas-run Gaza health ministry says more than 48,000 Palestinians have been killed in Israeli attacks.

        "Content": "Pope Francis is \"not out of danger\" and will remain in hospital for at least one more week, doctors treating him have said. However, in their first in-person update a week after the pontiff was taken to hospital, medics have also said he was not at risk of death. Sergio Alfieri, the chief of the pontiff's medical team, said: \"Is he out of danger? No. But if the question is 'is he in danger of death', the answer is 'no'.\" The 88-year-old pontiff is being treated for double pneumonia and chronic bronchitis at Rome's Gemelli hospital. Francis was affected by seasonal flu before being taken to hospital on 14 February, Dr Alfieri said, adding that \"due to his challenging duties\", the pontiff had suffered fatigue. Doctors at the Gemelli Hospital in Rome spoke for the first time in public – and failed to give the reassurance over the Pope's health Catholics around the world have been hoping for. The medical team revealed the Pope's life is still in danger. That is a very stark and worrying admission after a week of intense speculation. They say he isn't 'at risk of death'. But that seems to mean currently his condition is stable, though he is unable to leave hospital whilst undergoing such intensive treatment. The fact the Pope is not out of danger means he is fighting for his life, but doctors say it is possible the Pope can recover. But separately, Vatican sources have told Sky News of their concern that the Pope may not survive this hospitalisation. The positive signs are that the Pope is still eating, reading and getting out of bed. One doctor said he is working and 'has the brain of a 50-year-old'. He then said that Pope Francis was a \"fragile patient\" but was in \"good spirits\" and joking with medical staff. As part of his treatment, the Pope is receiving occasional supplements of oxygen. The doctors added he is responding to strengthened drug therapy for pneumonia. \n                  The Pope marks a week in hospital - as cardinal suggests he could resign in case of 'serious difficulties'\n                 \n                  Pope Francis 'improving slightly and working from hospital' amid talk of him quitting\n                 \n                  Pope Francis has 'bilateral pneumonia' but remains in 'good mood', Vatican says\n                 The doctors also warned that while he did not have sepsis - where germs enter the bloodstream - there was always a risk the infection could spread in his body. They added that was the biggest concern. Sepsis is a complication of an infection that can lead to organ failure and death. Dr Luigi Carbone, the pontiff's personal doctor, said Francis was responding to the drug therapy that was \"strengthened\" after the pneumonia was diagnosed earlier this week. He is also fighting a multipronged infection of bacteria and viruses in the respiratory tract. Read more from Sky News:'Severed hand' found near school in DublinZelenskyy has 'no cards' to negotiate with, says Trump Millions of people around the world have been concerned about the Pope's increasingly frail health - and his condition has given rise to speculation over a possible resignation.

On Thursday, the Vatican said the Pope's overall condition was \"improving slightly\" and his heart is working well. Pope Francis has a history of respiratory illness, having lost part of one of his lungs to pleurisy as a young man. He had an acute case of pneumonia in 2023."

        "Content": "\n          News reporter\n              @niamhielynch\n Passengers have reported a suspected norovirus outbreak on a P&O cruise ship off the coast of Belgium. One passenger on the P&O Iona told Sky News \"people have been dropping like flies\", with \"a large number\" of guests and staff experiencing symptoms. \"People [were] throwing up in restaurants, on decks, outside cabins,\" the passenger said. The P&O Iona, which can carry more than 5,000 passengers and 1,800 staff, is currently on a seven-day cruise across northern Europe, visiting Hamburg, Rotterdam and Zeebrugge. The current passenger numbers are unclear. P&O Cruises has confirmed to Sky News some of its guests \"have unfortunately reported gastrointestinal symptoms,\" however, they said it is currently affecting fewer than 1% of the passengers on board. A large number of families are understood to be on the cruise, which is taking place during the half-term break. It left Southampton on 15 February. The captain of the ship is understood to have made a public announcement on Thursday informing passengers of the outbreak, and said that staff were doing their best to stop the spread of infection. \n                  P&O spent £47m sacking and replacing 786 mainly British seafarers in 2022\n                 \n                  Why P&O Ferries' pariah status may never change\n                 \n                  P&O Ferries owner has 'turned a corner' since 800 staff sacked, minister says as £1bn investment to go ahead\n                 Some passengers who are isolating have said staff shortages have resulted in problems with having food delivered, as well as receiving new towels and bed linen.

Not one shop or medical centre onboard could supply guests with gastrointestinal suspension medication or replacement salts/fluid sachets.\" P&O Cruises told Sky News any symptomatic guests who were unable to join shore experiences will receive a full refund. They also said medication is \"readily available through our onboard medical centre\" and an emergency support number is available 24 hours a day. \"We are aware that some guests have unfortunately reported gastrointestinal symptoms recently on board Iona's Northern Europe cruise,\" P&O Cruises said in a statement. \"Gastrointestinal-related illnesses are very common in the UK and are predominantly spread by person-to-person transmission in environments such as hotels, schools and restaurants. \"P&O Cruises works with global, national and regional public health authorities on approved and proven protocols across our ships in order to protect the health and wellbeing of all on board.\""

        "Content": " A man has been found guilty of attempted murder for attacking author Sir Salman Rushdie. The 77-year-old British-American writer was stabbed multiple times as he was preparing to give a speech in New York in 2022. He was blinded in his right eye in the incident, suffered a severely damaged hand, and spent months recovering. Following a trial in Chautauqua County Court, a jury convicted 27-year-old Hadi Matar of attempting to murder Sir Salman, after less than two hours of deliberations. He was also found guilty of assault for wounding Henry Reese, who was on stage with Sir Salman at the time. Matar gave no obvious reaction to the verdict, and quietly muttered \"free Palestine\" as he was led out of the courtroom in handcuffs. The court heard Matar ran on to the stage at the Chautauqua Institution where the author was about to speak on 12 August 2022, and stabbed him in front of an audience. The Indian-born writer, who spent most of the 1990s in hiding in the UK after receiving death threats over his 1988 novel The Satanic Verses, was stabbed about 15 times. Sir Salman was attacked in the head, neck, torso, and left hand. He also suffered damage to his liver and intestines.  'I was dying' During the trial, Sir Salman described the moment Matar attacked him and told the court: \"I only saw him at the last minute. \"I was aware of someone wearing black clothes, or dark clothes and a black face mask. I was very struck by his eyes, which were dark and seemed very ferocious to me. \"I thought he was hitting me with his fist but I saw a large quantity of blood pouring onto my clothes. \"He was hitting me repeatedly. Hitting and slashing.\" The writer then said he felt \"a sense of great pain and shock,\" and added: \"It occurred to me that I was dying. That was my predominant thought.\" The court also heard that Mr Reese, the co-founder of Pittsburgh's City of Asylum, had suffered a gash to his forehead in the attack. 'Attack was unprovoked' During closing arguments earlier on Friday, District Attorney Jason Schmidt showed the jury a video of the attack and said: \"I want you to look at the unprovoked nature of this attack. \"I want you to look at the targeted nature of the attack. There were a lot of people around that day but there was only one person who was targeted.\" Matar's defence team argued prosecutors did not prove he intended to kill the writer, with Andrew Brautigan telling the jury: \"You will agree something bad happened to Mr Rushdie, but you don't know what Mr Matar's conscious objective was.\" Mr Schmidt said that while it was not possible to read Matar's mind, \"it's foreseeable that if you're going to stab someone 10 or 15 times about the face and neck, it's going to result in a fatality\". The judge set a sentencing date of 23 April, when Matar could be jailed for up to 25 years. Read more from Sky News:Pope 'not out of danger,' doctors say'Severed hand' found near school in Dublin Matar faces a separate, federal indictment from prosecutors in the US attorney's office in western New York alleging that he attempted to murder Sir Salman as an act of terrorism.

        "Content": " Donald Trump has said the US is close to agreeing a minerals deal with Ukraine - after accusing Britain and France of \"doing nothing\" to end the war. \"We're signing an agreement, hopefully in the next fairly short period of time,\" the president told reporters in the Oval Office. President Volodymyr Zelenskyy also said on Friday the two countries were \"working on a draft agreement\". His comments came after a conversation between his chief of staff and US national security adviser Mike Waltz on a minerals deal the Ukrainian leader had previously turned down. \"Here's the bottom line, President Zelenskyy is going to sign that deal, and you will see that in the very short term,\" Mr Waltz told the Conservative Political Action Conference in Maryland. It is also believed that US negotiators raised the possibility of cutting Ukraine's access to Elon Musk's vital Starlink satellite internet system if it did not agree to a deal. Earlier, Mr Trump called French President Emmanuel Macron a \"friend of mine\" and UK leader Sir Keir Starmer a \"nice guy\" but said Russia had only agreed to negotiate \"because of me\". Mr Trump made the comments days before both leaders visit the White House for a meeting in which they must try to press Ukraine's case while keeping the US leader onside. The president also continued his criticism of Mr Zelenskyy, saying he had \"no cards\" to play. \"I've been watching for years, and I've been watching him negotiate with no cards. He has no cards. And you get sick of it. You just get sick of it. And I've had it,\" he told a Fox radio show. The comments come after he recently called the Ukrainian leader a \"dictator without elections\" - apparently in response to Mr Zelenskyy saying his US counterpart was living in a \"disinformation space\" after Mr Trump claimed Ukraine had started the war.  Ukraine was also excluded from talks between the top US and Russian diplomats in Riyadh earlier this week. They were intended to set the stage for future negotiations on ending the war, which started when Russia launched a full-scale invasion three years ago. Speaking on Friday evening, Mr Trump denied speculation he could visit Moscow for talks on 9 May - the day Russia celebrates its victory over the Nazis. Mr Trump also told reporters the Russian and Ukrainian leaders needed to \"work together\" to end the war. However, the US has already dealt a huge blow to Kyiv's position in any future talks. US defence secretary Pete Hegseth said last week that a return to pre-war borders was \"unrealistic\" and ruled out NATO membership as a way to guarantee Kyiv's security.

Mr Kellogg struck a markedly different tone to President Trump when he called Mr Zelenskyy the \"courageous leader of a nation at war\".

The judge set a deadline of 9 April to submit pre-trial motions. In addition to the New York cases, Mr Mangione also faces charges of forgery, carrying firearms without a licence, and other counts in Pennsylvania, where authorities arrested him at a McDonald's. Police say he was in possession of a gun, bullets, multiple fake IDs and a handwritten document that expressed \"ill will\" towards corporate America. He is being held in a Brooklyn jail alongside several other high-profile defendants, including music mogul and rapper Sean \"Diddy\" Combs, and disgraced crypto entrepreneur Sam Bankman-Fried. The killing prompted some to voice their resentment at US health insurers, with Mangione attracting a cult following. A poll taken in the wake of the shooting showed most Americans believe health insurance profits and coverage denials were partly to blame for the incident."

        "Content": "\n          Business and economics correspondent\n              @gurpreetnarwan\n Apple's decision to withdraw its most secure cloud storage service from the UK is just the latest turning point in a battle that has been rumbling on between US tech companies and successive British governments for some time. The dispute centres on end-to-end encryption, a method of secure communication which enables only the sender and receiver to view messages. Ministers have long argued that the technology, in its current form, is preventing law enforcement agencies from catching criminals, including terrorists and paedophiles. However, Apple along with its fellow tech companies say they are not prepared to dilute the privacy commitments they have made to all their customers to meet their demands. Whitehall has been trying to tackle this issue for some time. Under the Online Safety Act 2023, it attempted to introduce client-side scanning. This would have forced tech companies to scan private messages before they were encrypted. Meta's WhatsApp and Signal threatened to exit the UK market in response, with the latter saying it would \"100% walk\". The government later rowed back. \n                  Apple removes advanced security tool over UK government row\n                 \n                  TikTok returns to major US app stores after Trump reassures tech giants\n                 \n                  Apple ordered by UK government to let it access users' encrypted data - reports\n                 'Snoopers charter' Now it has used the Investigatory Powers Act (IPA), the so-called 'snoopers charter', to try to force Apple to allow security authorities access to encrypted cloud data, which Apple itself does not view. Rather than create a backdoor for the government, the tech giant said it would disable Advanced Data Protection (ADP) in the UK altogether. This is its most advanced, end-to-end security encryption tool for the cloud. When using ADP, only account holders can see photos and other documents they have stored on the cloud. Apple users in UK lose extra security layer It means Apple is now complying with the law, and in that sense the government has got what it wanted, but it means users in the UK have lost the additional layer of security. The government believes the approach is necessary. In 2023, the Home Office published guidance, which stated that offences relating to online indecent images of children had increased by 13% over the previous year. It pointed to a YouGov poll, which suggested that the public support the view that tech companies should develop technology that allows them to identify child sexual abuse in end-to-end encrypted messaging apps. However, tech companies and security experts say a 'backdoor' isn't possible without undermining security and privacy for all users. Experts have been trying to develop one for the past 30 years, with little success. Some campaigners back tech firms It's not just tech companies who are fighting this corner. When reports of this latest effort first emerged last week, 109 civil society organisations, companies, and cybersecurity experts, published a joint letter to the home secretary Yvette Cooper, which said the demand \"jeopardises the security and privacy of millions, undermines the UK tech sector, and sets a dangerous precedent for global cybersecurity\". Campaigners also argue that the move could threaten global privacy rights. Human Rights Watch has described it as a disproportionate and an \"alarming overreach\".

Access to device backups is access to your entire phone, and strong encryption to prevent this access should be the norm by default.\" In the US, senator Ron Wyden and congressman Andy Biggs condemned the plan, calling it \"dangerous\" and \"short-sighted\". That being said, the US government has previously asked Apple to break its encryption to help with its criminal investigations, with little success. Apple can appeal the decision but, in taking on major US tech companies, the UK government has a huge fight on its hands."

Video of the area shared on social media shows an explosion happening outdoors near a swimming pool, scattering debris near the beach.

        "Content": " A man has been found guilty of attempted murder for attacking author Sir Salman Rushdie. The 77-year-old British-American writer was stabbed multiple times as he was preparing to give a speech in New York in 2022. He was blinded in his right eye in the incident, suffered a severely damaged hand, and spent months recovering. Following a trial in Chautauqua County Court, a jury convicted 27-year-old Hadi Matar of attempting to murder Sir Salman, after less than two hours of deliberations. He was also found guilty of assault for wounding Henry Reese, who was on stage with Sir Salman at the time. Matar gave no obvious reaction to the verdict, and quietly muttered \"free Palestine\" as he was led out of the courtroom in handcuffs. The court heard Matar ran on to the stage at the Chautauqua Institution where the author was about to speak on 12 August 2022, and stabbed him in front of an audience. The Indian-born writer, who spent most of the 1990s in hiding in the UK after receiving death threats over his 1988 novel The Satanic Verses, was stabbed about 15 times. Sir Salman was attacked in the head, neck, torso, and left hand. He also suffered damage to his liver and intestines.  'I was dying' During the trial, Sir Salman described the moment Matar attacked him and told the court: \"I only saw him at the last minute. \"I was aware of someone wearing black clothes, or dark clothes and a black face mask. I was very struck by his eyes, which were dark and seemed very ferocious to me. \"I thought he was hitting me with his fist but I saw a large quantity of blood pouring onto my clothes. \"He was hitting me repeatedly. Hitting and slashing.\" The writer then said he felt \"a sense of great pain and shock,\" and added: \"It occurred to me that I was dying. That was my predominant thought.\" The court also heard that Mr Reese, the co-founder of Pittsburgh's City of Asylum, had suffered a gash to his forehead in the attack. 'Attack was unprovoked' During closing arguments earlier on Friday, District Attorney Jason Schmidt showed the jury a video of the attack and said: \"I want you to look at the unprovoked nature of this attack. \"I want you to look at the targeted nature of the attack. There were a lot of people around that day but there was only one person who was targeted.\" Matar's defence team argued prosecutors did not prove he intended to kill the writer, with Andrew Brautigan telling the jury: \"You will agree something bad happened to Mr Rushdie, but you don't know what Mr Matar's conscious objective was.\" Mr Schmidt said that while it was not possible to read Matar's mind, \"it's foreseeable that if you're going to stab someone 10 or 15 times about the face and neck, it's going to result in a fatality\". The judge set a sentencing date of 23 April, when Matar could be jailed for up to 25 years. Read more from Sky News:Pope 'not out of danger,' doctors say'Severed hand' found near school in Dublin Matar faces a separate, federal indictment from prosecutors in the US attorney's office in western New York alleging that he attempted to murder Sir Salman as an act of terrorism.

        "Content": "\n          Science and Technology reporter\n        Apple will no longer offer customers in the UK its most advanced, end-to-end security encryption feature for cloud data storage - following a row with the government. The Advanced Data Protection (ADP) tool is an optional feature which means only account holders can see things like photos or documents that they have stored online. Apple itself does not have access to the data. However, the UK government reportedly requested the right to see the data earlier this month. In response, Apple has removed the tool from use in the UK. The company is switching it off as an option for those not already using it, and will introduce a process to move existing users away from it. Security officials argue that encryption hinders criminal investigations, while tech firms defend it as essential to user privacy. The loss of end-to-end encryption for iCloud backup means Apple would be able in some instances to read user data such as iMessages that would otherwise be protected and pass it on to authorities if legally compelled. \n                  Apple removes end-to-end security encryption tool for UK cloud users rather than renege on its privacy commitments to all\n                 \n                  TikTok returns to major US app stores after Trump reassures tech giants\n                 \n                  Apple ordered by UK government to let it access users' encrypted data - reports\n                 However, if a user has end-to-end encryption, Apple cannot read the data under any circumstances. What has Apple said? \"We are gravely disappointed that the protections provided by ADP will not be available to our customers in the UK given the continuing rise of data breaches and other threats to customer privacy,\" Apple said in a statement. \"Enhancing the security of cloud storage with end-to-end encryption is more urgent than ever before. \"Apple remains committed to offering our users the highest level of security for their personal data and are hopeful that we will be able to do so in the future in the United Kingdom.\" Business and economics correspondent Apple's decision to withdraw its most secure cloud storage service from the UK is just the latest turning point in a battle that has been rumbling on between US tech companies and successive British governments for some time. The dispute centres on end-to-end encryption, a method of secure communication which enables only the sender and receiver to view messages. Ministers have long argued that the technology, in its current form, is preventing law enforcement agencies from catching criminals, including terrorists and paedophiles. However, Apple along with its fellow tech companies say they are not prepared to dilute the privacy commitments they have made to all their customers to meet their demands. Whitehall has been trying to tackle this issue for some time.

It is already unavailable for customers who weren't using the feature, who now see a message that reads: \"Apple can no longer offer Advanced Data Protection (ADP) in the United Kingdom to new users.\" What has the UK government said? The government said it will not confirm or deny whether it requested a Technical Capability Notice (TCN), which is what would give it the right to see the encrypted data. \"We do not comment on operational matters, including for example confirming or denying the existence of any such notices,\" a Home Office spokesperson told Sky News. According to a Home Office source, however, even if a TCN was issued, it wouldn't give the government blanket access to people's data. Separate authorisations or warrants would still be required. What's the reaction from the tech industry? Many in the tech industry are shocked by Apple's move, with Graeme Stewart from cybersecurity company Check Point saying it \"is effectively smashing open Pandora's box and hoping the chaos stays neatly inside\". \"At its heart, encryption isn't just for criminals; it's a shield for millions of law-abiding citizens, businesses, and critical infrastructure,\" he said. \"Now we are prying open that door to our digital Fort Knox, there's no telling what else might slip through.\" Apple was also described as \"calling the government's bluff\" by technology partner at Keystone Law, Robert Peake, for refusing to create a backdoor into its protected data. \"The government will face increasing pressure to back down on this, as it seriously undermines its recent attempts to portray the UK as a pro-innovation place to operate,\" he said."

It's the first growth since August and follows a fall of 0.6% in the key shopping month of December, according to Office for National Statistics (ONS) figures. There has not been an increase of this size since May. It came as food shop sales rose 5.6% - the highest amount since March 2020 when COVID-19 lockdowns began.

The greatest budget surplus since records began in 1993 was reported by the Office for National Statistics (ONS) in January. It means the public sector took in more taxes and other income than it spent, leading to a surplus of £15.4bn. But the figures showed borrowing was £11.6bn more than a year earlier and the fourth-highest on record. Money blog: Britain's best beer revealed For the year as a whole, borrowing is ahead of the independent forecaster the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR)'s expected £105.4bn level, having come in at £118.2bn. January is always a big month for tax takes as self-assessed returns come in, but the tax revenue and the surplus were below economist forecasts.  It was the first data release on public sector finances since January market jitters. Last month the pound weakened and 10 and 30-year borrowing costs soared, causing concern Ms Reeves would break her self-imposed fiscal rules - to bring down government debt and balance the budget by 2030 - or have to up Government borrowing costs surged in the month, resulting in decades-high interest rates on long-term state debt, known as bonds. Higher inflation and an expectation of higher interest rates for longer in part caused the spike and raised fears the chancellor would have eroded her so-called fiscal headroom - money she could spend while still adhering to her rules. What does it mean for tax cuts and spending? \"It will only get worse from here\", said Pantheon Macro's senior UK economist, Elliott Jordan-Doak. The economic research firm said it expects the chancellor's headroom has been wiped out and spending cuts will follow with tax rises coming in the autumn. Another economics research firm reached a similar conclusion: \"In order to meet her fiscal rules, the chancellor will need to raise taxes and/or cut spending in the fiscal update on 26 March\", Capital's UK economist Alex Kerr said. Responding to the data, Ms Reeves's deputy Darren Jones said: \"This government is committed to delivering economic stability and meeting our non-negotiable fiscal rules. \"We will never play fast and loose with the public finances, that's why we're going through every pound spent, line by line, for the first time in 17 years, ensuring every penny delivers on the country's priorities in our plan for change.\""

Sky News has learnt that Monument Bank, which now has roughly £5bn in assets, has told existing and potential investors that it is targeting a listing on New York's Nasdaq exchange by the end of 2027, with a secondary listing on a major Middle Eastern or Indian exchange possible the following year. The British-based lender, whose founding chairman was the former Co-operative Bank chief executive Niall Booker, has already raised about £135m from blue-chip investors since it launched in 2019. Money blog: Britain's best beer revealed It has now secured roughly £30m of the £200m Series C financing it wants to raise during the course of this year. Insiders said the bank was expected to be valued at around £1bn after the fundraising completes. Monument Bank - named after the famous commemoration to the Great Fire of London in the City - wants to become the bank of choice for approximately 4.8 million professionals, entrepreneurs, property investors and other mass-affluent customers in the UK. \n                  Insurance unicorn Marshmallow finalises fundraising at £1.5bn valuation\n                 \n                  More than 130 Lloyds, Halifax and Bank of Scotland branches to close\n                 \n                  Barclays to slash CEO's fixed pay as package capped at £14m\n                 To date, it is said to have opened more than 60,000 accounts. It counts Monument Technology Limited, which recently completed a separate funding round, as a subsidiary, although some of the technology arm's investors are not among the bank's shareholders. In response to an enquiry from Sky News, Ian Rand, the former Barclays executive who is now chief executive of Monument Bank, confirmed that it was aiming to raise up to £200m. \"We anticipate that this will be our final fundraise that will support our product and international expansion, and fund our path to listing,\" he said. \"We will explore all options for listing and make the final decision at the appropriate time.\" One banking source said other exchange venues had not been ruled out, but marketing materials circulated in connection with the Series C round make explicit reference to the desire for a Nasdaq listing. A decision to list overseas would be perceived as another blow to the London Stock Exchange given the company's name and heritage. Other so-called challenger banks, such as Monzo, have been at the centre of speculation recently about whether they would seek to float in London or New York. Shawbrook Bank has drawn up plans to go public in London this year, Sky News reported last month. Monument Bank has already built a customer base with deposits far in excess of most UK peers, at more than £60,000 on average. It also wants to secure banking licences in Dubai and India, according to one of its existing shareholders."

        "Content": "The Birkenstock sandal is recognisable for its big buckles, wide-straps, and cork-made sole. But the shoes do not qualify as works of art, Germany's highest civil court has ruled. The German shoe company had filed a lawsuit against three competitors who sold sandals that were similar to its own, by claiming its products \"are copyright-protected works of applied art\" that may not be imitated. But the case was dismissed, with Federal Court of Justice judge Thomas Koch calling the claims \"unfounded\" because the sandals are not copy-right protected. In his ruling, he wrote that for copyright protection to apply, \"a level of design must be achieved that reveals individuality\". Under German law, copyright protection is valid for 70 years after the creator's death, while design protection hinges on the product's lifespan and ends after 25 years. The legal distinction between design and art in German law lies in a product's purpose. Design serves a practical function, while works of applied art require a discernible level of individual artistic creativity. Birkenstock creator and shoemaker Karl Birkenstock, who was born in 1936, is still alive, but since he crafted his initial designs in the 1970s, some sandals no longer enjoy design protection. As a result, lawyers for the company asked the court to classify the shoes as art. Lawyer Konstantin Wegner argued the sandals had an \"iconic design\" and said there would be further litigation after the federal court of justice's decision was announced. The case has proved contentious, having been heard at two lower courts previously, which disagreed on the issue. A regional court in Cologne initially recognised the shoes as works of applied art and granted the orders, but Cologne's higher regional court overturned the orders on appeal, according to German news agency DPA. The appeals court said it was unable to establish any artistic achievement in the sandal. Once popular with hippies, tech enthusiasts and medical professionals, Birkenstock gained widespread attention after Australian actress Margot Robbie wore a pair of pink Birkenstocks in the final scene of the 2023 hit movie Barbie. Has this happened before? Historically, it is tricky for fashion pieces to be deemed as original works of art. In the UK, to obtain copyright protection, works of fashion need to fall into one of the eight categories set out in the Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988. Copyright is also different to trademark, the first protects the original creative elements of a design, like unique patterns, prints, or graphic designs, while the latter protects a brand's identity like logos, names, and symbols that distinguish it from competitors. One rare example of success happened in the Netherlands in 2004, and centred on perfume, not clothing.

The court ruled at the time that Tresor is original and carries a personal stamp from the maker, and could therefore be considered a copyrighted work under the country's Copyright Act of 1912. Kecofa was also ordered to pay €16,398 to Lancome, plus all its profits from the sale of Female Treasure, according to court documents."

Getlink believes there is the potential for services to open up between London and locations such as Bordeaux, Cologne, Frankfurt, Geneva, Marseille, and Zurich. The potential new routes would end the need for passengers to change trains. No timeline for such expansions has been revealed. Eurostar currently holds a monopoly in running passenger services through the Channel Tunnel, which opened in 1994. Passengers are able to use Eurostar services to get to Pairs and Brussels as well as seasonal ski trains to the French Alps. Earlier this month, the company also resumed direct services from London to Amsterdam after an eight-month hold-up while a new terminal was built in the Netherlands. But Spanish start-up company Evolyn and billionaire entrepreneur Sir Richard Branson's Virgin Group are developing proposals to launch rival services. Robert Sinclair, chief executive of Highspeed, said the company will actively work with Getlink to \"encourage new and existing train operators to expand capacity and launch new destinations unlocking the potential of a fully connected Europe\". He added that he wants rail to be \"the preferred option for travelling to Europe\".

        "Content": " Jess Phillips has said \"there is no place\" where violence against women and girls \"doesn't happen\" - as a new law is set to make spiking a criminal offence. Earlier on Friday, the government said spiking will now be its own offence with a possible 10-year prison sentence as part of the Crime and Policing Bill, which will be introduced in parliament next week. It also announced a nationwide training programme to help workers spot and prevent attacks. Speaking to Sky News correspondent Ashna Hurynag, the safeguarding minister said that while spiking is already illegal under existing laws, the new classification will simplify reporting the act for victims. \"Spiking is illegal - that isn't in question, but what victims and campaigners who have tried to use the legislation as it currently is have told us is that it's unclear,\" Ms Phillips said. UK 'was never safe' for women When asked if the UK is becoming a less safe place for women, the minister for safeguarding and violence against women and girls, said: \"I don't think it's becoming less safe, if I'm being honest. I think it was never safe.\" Speaking about a rise in coverage, Ms Phillips said: \"We have a real opportunity to use that, the sense of feeling [built by campaigners] in the country, to really push forward political change in this space.\" \"The reality is that it doesn't matter whether it's the House of Commons or any pub in your local high street - there is no place where violence against women and girls doesn't happen, I'm afraid,\" she added.

London's Metropolitan Police added that reports of spiking had increased by 13% in 2023, with 1,383 allegations.  As part of the nationwide training programme, a £250,000 government-funded scheme was started last week to teach staff how to spot warning signs of spiking crimes, prevent incidents and gather evidence.

Come forward and help us catch these criminals.\" Colin Mackie, founder of Spike Aware UK, also said the charity is \"delighted with the steps being taken by the government to combat spiking\".

The Solicitors' Regulation Authority (SRA) initially said there was \"no need to take any action\" after Mr Reynolds was accused of misrepresenting his past work as a lawyer. The business secretary worked for Addleshaw Goddard LLP in Manchester as a trainee solicitor before he was elected as a Labour MP in 2010 and never qualified as a solicitor. Mr Reynolds has been accused of describing himself as a solicitor on several occasions - including on his LinkedIn page, in the Commons and on an old constituency website that is no longer online - when he had actually only worked as a trainee. Politics latest: Northern Ireland first minister to boycott White House The SRA contacted the business secretary in January about an error on his LinkedIn profile which was then corrected, it is understood, and the regulator said that having considered \"all factors involved, there is no need for us to take any action\".

He has also urged Sir Keir Starmer to take action against Mr Reynolds, saying: \"As a former director of public prosecutions, Keir Starmer doesn't need to wait - he should be able to judge from the evidence before him that Reynolds doesn't have a leg to stand on and sack him.''

They said Mr Reynolds immediately corrected an administrative error on his LinkedIn profile when the error was highlighted to him and that he did not manage the profile. They also pointed out the business secretary has referred to himself as a \"trainee solicitor\" on a number of occasions, including when he visited his previous law firm in 2023 and posted about it on Instagram. A Labour spokesperson said: \"Jonathan looks forward to engaging fully with the Solicitors Regulation Authority and drawing a line under the matter.\""

Michelle O'Neill, who is also the vice president of Sinn Fein, will be joined by the party's leader Mary Lou McDonald in boycotting the annual ceremony to mark the national holiday on 17 March. Ms McDonald said she will not attend the event at the White House over \"a principled stance against the threat of mass expulsion of the Palestinian people from Gaza\" - a reference to recent comments by US President Donald Trump. Speaking at a press conference in Dublin, Ms O'Neill said she \"cannot ignore\" Mr Trump's comments and her decision not to travel to the White House meant she was standing \"on the side of humanity\". Politics latest: Lib Dems call for tax hike on tech giants to boost defence spending \"The decision to not travel to the White House has not been taken lightly, but it is taken very conscious of the responsibility that each of us have as individuals to call out injustice when we see it,\" she said. \"We are all heartbroken whenever we witness the suffering of the Palestinian people, and the recent comments by the US president around the mass expulsion of the Palestinian people from Gaza is just simply something that I cannot ignore.\" \n                  Israel checking reports of hostage Shiri Bibas's body being handed over\n                 \n                  Shiri Bibas 'mix-up' row: A fragile Gaza ceasefire stumbles from one hurdle more painful than the last\n                 \n                  Hamas names six Israeli hostages to be released on Saturday\n                 She added: \"At times like this, people look towards political leaders to stand against injustice. So in the future whenever our children and grandchildren ask us what did we do when the Palestinian people endured unimaginable suffering, I can say firmly that I stood on the side of humanity.\" The Sinn Fein leaders were challenged at the press conference on why they believed it was right for Micheal Martin, the Taoiseach and Ireland's head of government, to go to the White House, but not Ms O'Neill, who is joint leader of Northern Ireland's devolved government. They said the Taoiseach's engagement with Mr Trump was \"distinct\" and \"unique\", as he would have a bilateral political meeting with the president - something Ms O'Neill would not have - where he could \"make his views known\". Mr Trump sparked international alarm earlier this month when he laid out his plans for the Middle East in a news conference alongside Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu at the White House. The US president called Gaza a \"demolition site\" and said the two million Palestinians who currently live there could go to \"various domains\" - and that his \"takeover\" plans would not include a right of return for those who left.  Mr Trump did also not rule out sending US troops to the region, and said his plan would \"develop\" Gaza and create \"thousands and thousands of jobs\". \"Everybody I've spoken to loves the idea of the United States owning that piece of land, developing and creating thousands of jobs,\" Mr Trump said, adding that Gaza could become \"the Riviera of the Middle East\" where \"the world's people\" could live. America traditionally enjoys a close relationship with Ireland owing to ancestral ties and history, but the war in Gaza and US support for Israel in the aftermath of the Hamas attack on 7 October 2023 has put that under strain. Ireland has been one of the world's most vocal supporters of the Palestinian cause and in 2024, along with Norway and Spain, it officially recognised Palestine as a separate state - prompting Israel to recall its ambassadors from two of the European states.  Last year Ms McDonald rejected calls for a boycott of the White House over the US position on Gaza under Joe Biden's presidency, arguing that she had used the \"unparalleled\" influence Ireland ha sin Washington to raise concerns about the Middle East. President Trump's proposal to transfer the Palestinian population out of Gaza and redevelop it under US ownership has been criticised by Palestinians, human rights groups, regional powers and US allies, but last week Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said it was \"the only viable plan to enable a different future\".

Hamas has since said it will investigate the claims. Ms Bibas was kidnapped with her sons - four-year-old Ariel, and nine-month-old Kfir - from the Niz Or kibbutz during the Palestinian militant group's incursion into Israel in October 2023, which killed 1,195 people, according to Israeli authorities, including 815 civilians. Israel's subsequent invasion of the Gaza Strip has killed more than 47,000 Palestinians, according to health officials in Gaza, and 405 Israeli soldiers, according to the Israeli military."

The government has begun rolling out the 700,000 extra urgent appointments it promised in its election-winning manifesto, However, dentist representatives say this means only an extra two slots per month will be added for each NHS dentist. Under the plan to roll out the appointments, NHS England has written to integrated care boards (ICB) across the country, instructing practices to stand up thousands of urgent appointments over the coming year. The extra appointments will be available from April and have been targeted at so-called \"dental deserts\" - where getting an NHS appointment is near impossible.

Data shows as many as six in 10 children have rotting teeth by the age of five - with stark differences between the poorer regions of England, and the more affluent. For example, the number of five-year-olds with poor dental hygiene was on the rise in London, the North East and the South West. Jason Wong, chief dental officer for England, said: \"Dentists are working hard to help as many patients as possible but too many people experience difficulties in accessing NHS dental services. \"It is vital that we do more to improve access - we are working with local systems to prioritise this, which includes providing 700,000 additional urgent dental appointments to help make it quicker and easier for those most in need to be seen and treated on the NHS and we are incentivising dentists to work in underserved areas so that all areas of the country can receive the care they need.\" Health minister Stephen Kinnock warned that the rollout would \"take time\" but said it was an \"important step towards getting NHS dentistry back on its feet.\".  \"NHS dentistry has been left broken after years of neglect, with patients left in pain without appointments, or queueing around the block just to be seen,\" he added. \"Through our plan for change, this government will rebuild dentistry, focusing on prevention, retention of NHS dentists and reforming the NHS contract to make NHS work more appealing to dentists and increase capacity for more patients.\" The British Dental Association (BDA), which represents dentists and dental students across the UK, welcomed the announcement as \"progress\" but said the extra appointments would translate into each of the 24,200 dentists recorded as carrying out NHS services last year seeing the equivalent of a little over two extra urgent cases a month. It warned that the total unmet need for NHS dentistry in England still amounted to 13 million people - or one in four adults. Shiv Pabary, chairman of the BDA's general dental practice committee, said: \"It's progress, but government could have fired the starting gun on commissioning urgent care last summer.

New dentists are also being recruited in areas that need them most, along with a focus on retaining existing staff - some of whom will be rewarded \"golden hellos\" of up to £20,000 if they agree to work in areas that are usually hard to recruit in."

The Advanced Data Protection (ADP) tool is an optional feature which means only account holders can see things like photos or documents that they have stored online. Apple itself does not have access to the data. However, the UK government reportedly requested the right to see the data earlier this month. In response, Apple has removed the tool from use in the UK.

Security officials argue that encryption hinders criminal investigations, while tech firms defend it as essential to user privacy.

The dispute centres on end-to-end encryption, a method of secure communication which enables only the sender and receiver to view messages. Ministers have long argued that the technology, in its current form, is preventing law enforcement agencies from catching criminals, including terrorists and paedophiles. However, Apple along with its fellow tech companies say they are not prepared to dilute the privacy commitments they have made to all their customers to meet their demands.

Many in the tech industry are shocked by Apple's move, with Graeme Stewart from cybersecurity company Check Point saying it \"is effectively smashing open Pandora's box and hoping the chaos stays neatly inside\". \"At its heart, encryption isn't just for criminals; it's a shield for millions of law-abiding citizens, businesses, and critical infrastructure,\" he said. \"Now we are prying open that door to our digital Fort Knox, there's no telling what else might slip through.\" Apple was also described as \"calling the government's bluff\" by technology partner at Keystone Law, Robert Peake, for refusing to create a backdoor into its protected data. \"The government will face increasing pressure to back down on this, as it seriously undermines its recent attempts to portray the UK as a pro-innovation place to operate,\" he said."

        "Content": "\n          Business and economics correspondent\n              @gurpreetnarwan\n Apple's decision to withdraw its most secure cloud storage service from the UK is just the latest turning point in a battle that has been rumbling on between US tech companies and successive British governments for some time. The dispute centres on end-to-end encryption, a method of secure communication which enables only the sender and receiver to view messages. Ministers have long argued that the technology, in its current form, is preventing law enforcement agencies from catching criminals, including terrorists and paedophiles. However, Apple along with its fellow tech companies say they are not prepared to dilute the privacy commitments they have made to all their customers to meet their demands. Whitehall has been trying to tackle this issue for some time. Under the Online Safety Act 2023, it attempted to introduce client-side scanning. This would have forced tech companies to scan private messages before they were encrypted. Meta's WhatsApp and Signal threatened to exit the UK market in response, with the latter saying it would \"100% walk\". The government later rowed back. \n                  Apple removes advanced security tool over UK government row\n                 \n                  TikTok returns to major US app stores after Trump reassures tech giants\n                 \n                  Apple ordered by UK government to let it access users' encrypted data - reports\n                 'Snoopers charter' Now it has used the Investigatory Powers Act (IPA), the so-called 'snoopers charter', to try to force Apple to allow security authorities access to encrypted cloud data, which Apple itself does not view. Rather than create a backdoor for the government, the tech giant said it would disable Advanced Data Protection (ADP) in the UK altogether. This is its most advanced, end-to-end security encryption tool for the cloud. When using ADP, only account holders can see photos and other documents they have stored on the cloud. Apple users in UK lose extra security layer It means Apple is now complying with the law, and in that sense the government has got what it wanted, but it means users in the UK have lost the additional layer of security. The government believes the approach is necessary. In 2023, the Home Office published guidance, which stated that offences relating to online indecent images of children had increased by 13% over the previous year. It pointed to a YouGov poll, which suggested that the public support the view that tech companies should develop technology that allows them to identify child sexual abuse in end-to-end encrypted messaging apps. However, tech companies and security experts say a 'backdoor' isn't possible without undermining security and privacy for all users. Experts have been trying to develop one for the past 30 years, with little success. Some campaigners back tech firms It's not just tech companies who are fighting this corner. When reports of this latest effort first emerged last week, 109 civil society organisations, companies, and cybersecurity experts, published a joint letter to the home secretary Yvette Cooper, which said the demand \"jeopardises the security and privacy of millions, undermines the UK tech sector, and sets a dangerous precedent for global cybersecurity\". Campaigners also argue that the move could threaten global privacy rights. Human Rights Watch has described it as a disproportionate and an \"alarming overreach\".

Access to device backups is access to your entire phone, and strong encryption to prevent this access should be the norm by default.\" In the US, senator Ron Wyden and congressman Andy Biggs condemned the plan, calling it \"dangerous\" and \"short-sighted\". That being said, the US government has previously asked Apple to break its encryption to help with its criminal investigations, with little success. Apple can appeal the decision but, in taking on major US tech companies, the UK government has a huge fight on its hands."

        "Content": " Elon Musk has had a heated exchange with famed astronaut Andreas Mogensen who accused has him of lying over claims that two NASA astronauts had been \"left\" in space. Speaking during a pre-recorded interview with US President Donald Trump on Fox News, Mr Musk alleged the astronauts had been \"left up there for political reasons\" - a claim Mr Mogensen denounced as a \"lie\". The SpaceX CEO said he was working to \"accelerate\" the return of NASA's Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams from the International Space Station (ISS) at the president's \"instruction\". Mr Musk, who also leads the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), an advisory department under the Trump administration, said the astronauts' return had been \"postponed to a ridiculous degree\". Mr Trump, meanwhile, pointed the finger at former President Joe Biden, as he said: \"They got left in space\". Danish astronaut Andreas Mogensen shared a clip of the Fox News interview on X and said: \"What a lie. \"And from someone who complains about lack of honesty from the mainstream media.\" \n                  Day 33: Has Musk taken a chainsaw to US politics?\n                 \n                  'Why am I the fat?': Beauty and popularity of Yosemite can't save workers from Musk's DOGE cutbacks\n                 \n                  Day 31: 'You should never have started it' - Trump's message to Ukraine\n                 Read more:Elon Musk denies 'hostile takeover' of US governmentElon Musk's X to pay Trump $10m compensation Mr Musk retorted by calling the astronaut an \"idiot\". \"SpaceX could have brought them back several months ago,\" Mr Musk wrote. \"I OFFERED THIS DIRECTLY to the Biden administration and they refused. Return WAS pushed back for political reasons. Idiot.\" Mr Mogensen replied saying: \"Elon, I have long admired you and what you have accomplished, especially at SpaceX and Tesla. \"You know as well as I do, that Butch and Suni are returning with Crew-9, as has been the plan since last September. \"Even now, you are not sending up a rescue ship to bring them home. They are returning on the Dragon capsule that has been on ISS since last September.\" There were no further replies from Mr Musk. Mr Wilmore and Ms Williams, who have been on the ISS since June 2024, originally planned to go to space for just eight days but got stuck on the station after their Boeing Starliner spacecraft started experiencing problems. The astronauts are waiting for the next crew to arrive at the ISS, however, the launch of their replacements on a SpaceX capsule was delayed in December, which added more time to their mission. They are expected to return to Earth next month."

In January, the company sent shockwaves through the West when it unveiled an AI model as powerful as ChatGPT that can run at a fraction of the cost. Now, Shenzhen University in southern Guangdong province has confirmed it is launching an artificial intelligence course based on DeepSeek that will help students learn about key technologies. Students will also study security, privacy and other challenges posed by artificial intelligence. The move comes as Chinese authorities aim to boost scientific and technological innovation in schools and universities that can create new sources of growth. The course will \"explore how to find a balance between technological innovation and ethical norms\", said the university.

On Monday, China's premier Xi Jinping held a rare meeting of the country's tech leaders. He encouraged them to \"show their talent\" and be confident in the power of China's model and market.  One analyst said the meeting was a reflection of the Chinese government's concern that it is lagging behind the US when it comes to technology. \"It's a tacit acknowledgement that the Chinese government needs private-sector firms for its tech rivalry with the United States,\" said Christopher Beddor, deputy China research director at Gavekal Dragonomics in Hong Kong."

        "Content": "A Spanish photographer has been named Underwater Photographer of the Year for his picture of a humpback whale and her newborn calf in French Polynesia.  Alvaro Herrero beat more than 6,750 other entries to take home this year's prize. His photo shows \"a mother's love and communicates the beauty and fragility of life in our ocean\", the competition's organisers said. Judge Peter Rowlands added: \"This delicate yet powerful study of a mother and calf's bond says all that is great and good about our world. \"We face our challenges, but the increasing populations of humpback whales worldwide shows what can be achieved.\" The Underwater Photographer of the Year competition, which started in 1965, celebrates photography beneath the surface of the ocean, lakes, rivers and even swimming pools, and attracts entries from around the world. There are 13 categories, testing photographers with themes such as macro, wide angle, behaviour and wreck photography. David Alpert was named the British Underwater Photographer of the Year for his image titled The Curious Seal. He said his photo challenges misconceptions that British waters are murky and lifeless. \"My photo is from Lundy Island, a marine protected area since 1973,\" Mr Alpert said. \"British seals are delightfully curious, more interactive than any other species I have dived with around the world. Briefly, I become one of the privileged few, crossing the bridge, able to make a connection with a wild animal.\" Meanwhile, South Korea's Ruruka was named the Up and Coming Underwater Photographer of the Year. His entry, titled Underwater Aurora, shows a diver in the waters of a cenote sinkhole in Mexico. Ruruka travelled around 24 hours from his home to capture the image during the rainy season, when more tannin-rich water drains into the sinkhole, creating the bands of colour."

        "Content": " A man has been found guilty of attempted murder for attacking author Sir Salman Rushdie. The 77-year-old British-American writer was stabbed multiple times as he was preparing to give a speech in New York in 2022. He was blinded in his right eye in the incident, suffered a severely damaged hand, and spent months recovering. Following a trial in Chautauqua County Court, a jury convicted 27-year-old Hadi Matar of attempting to murder Sir Salman, after less than two hours of deliberations. He was also found guilty of assault for wounding Henry Reese, who was on stage with Sir Salman at the time. Matar gave no obvious reaction to the verdict, and quietly muttered \"free Palestine\" as he was led out of the courtroom in handcuffs. The court heard Matar ran on to the stage at the Chautauqua Institution where the author was about to speak on 12 August 2022, and stabbed him in front of an audience. The Indian-born writer, who spent most of the 1990s in hiding in the UK after receiving death threats over his 1988 novel The Satanic Verses, was stabbed about 15 times. Sir Salman was attacked in the head, neck, torso, and left hand. He also suffered damage to his liver and intestines.  'I was dying' During the trial, Sir Salman described the moment Matar attacked him and told the court: \"I only saw him at the last minute. \"I was aware of someone wearing black clothes, or dark clothes and a black face mask. I was very struck by his eyes, which were dark and seemed very ferocious to me. \"I thought he was hitting me with his fist but I saw a large quantity of blood pouring onto my clothes. \"He was hitting me repeatedly. Hitting and slashing.\" The writer then said he felt \"a sense of great pain and shock,\" and added: \"It occurred to me that I was dying. That was my predominant thought.\" The court also heard that Mr Reese, the co-founder of Pittsburgh's City of Asylum, had suffered a gash to his forehead in the attack. 'Attack was unprovoked' During closing arguments earlier on Friday, District Attorney Jason Schmidt showed the jury a video of the attack and said: \"I want you to look at the unprovoked nature of this attack. \"I want you to look at the targeted nature of the attack. There were a lot of people around that day but there was only one person who was targeted.\" Matar's defence team argued prosecutors did not prove he intended to kill the writer, with Andrew Brautigan telling the jury: \"You will agree something bad happened to Mr Rushdie, but you don't know what Mr Matar's conscious objective was.\" Mr Schmidt said that while it was not possible to read Matar's mind, \"it's foreseeable that if you're going to stab someone 10 or 15 times about the face and neck, it's going to result in a fatality\". The judge set a sentencing date of 23 April, when Matar could be jailed for up to 25 years. Read more from Sky News:Pope 'not out of danger,' doctors say'Severed hand' found near school in Dublin Matar faces a separate, federal indictment from prosecutors in the US attorney's office in western New York alleging that he attempted to murder Sir Salman as an act of terrorism.
