        "Content": " Volodymyr Zelenskyy has said he is \"exchangeable\" for Ukrainian membership of NATO, indicating he would be prepared to step down as president if his country was allowed to join the military alliance. He also suggested he was ready to sign a minerals deal with the US that was put on hold after his heated meeting with Donald Trump in the Oval Office on Friday. Mr Zelenskyy was speaking to reporters on Sunday evening after earlier talks with other world leaders at a London summit hosted by Sir Keir Starmer, who suggested a coalition of European allies could step up to defend Ukraine and \"guarantee the peace\". Latest updates on Ukraine's future Asked by Sky News' lead world news presenter Yalda Hakim if he could quit in the event his country becomes a NATO member, he said: \"I am exchangeable for NATO.\" The Ukraine president added: \"I have said that I am exchanging for NATO membership, then it means I have fulfilled my mission. NATO means I have fulfilled my mission.\" But, he continued: \"To change me, it will not be easy because it is not enough to simply hold elections. You would need to prevent me from participating. And it will be a bit more difficult.\" \n                  Symbolism and substance as European leaders take small steps towards peace in Ukraine\n                 \n                  'We can still trust the Americans', minister says despite breakdown between Trump and Zelenskyy\n                 \n                  UK, France and Ukraine to work on ceasefire and present plan to Trump, says Starmer\n                 Mr Zelenskyy has also rebuffed US officials calling for him to resign. His comments at Stansted Airport come after Republicans including senator Lindsay Graham and speaker Mike Johnson suggested he should step down from his position following the fiery White House exchange with President Trump. Mr Zelenskyy spoke to journalists shortly before leaving the UK on Sunday evening. In response to a question from Yalda Hakim, Mr Zelenskyy said: \"I can give [Lindsay Graham] citizenship of Ukraine and he will become a citizen of our country. \"And then his voice will start to gain weight, and I will hear him as a citizen of Ukraine on the topic of who must be the president.\" \"The president of Ukraine will have to be chosen not in Lindsay Graham's home but in Ukraine,\" he added. Mr Zelenskyy confirmed there has been communication between Ukraine and the Trump administration since the clash on Friday, but \"not on my level\". Mr Graham - a Republican senator and close Trump ally - labelled the meeting a \"complete, utter disaster\" at a press briefing on Friday.  Asked whether Mr Zelenskyy should step aside, he said: \"He either needs to resign or send somebody over that we can do business with, or he needs to change.\" After the London summit on Sunday, the prime minister unveiled a four-step plan discussed by leaders, including a pledge to \"develop a coalition of the willing\" to defend a deal in Ukraine and guarantee a peace settlement. Sir Keir said Europe \"must do the heavy lifting\", and the UK \"is prepared to back this with boots on the ground and planes in the air, together with others\". He also announced a new deal which will allow Ukraine to use Â£1.6bn of UK export finance to buy 5,000 more air defence missiles. Zelenskyy's meeting with the King The Ukrainian president's 90-minute sit down with the media came shortly after he wrapped up a tough week with a visit to see the King at Sandringham. Mr Zelenskyy flew to Norfolk in a helicopter on Sunday afternoon after attending the security summit in central London. People - some holding Ukraine flags - gathered outside Sandringham to try to witness his arrival. A military helicopter could be seen flying low before descending over the estate. Pictures released after the meeting show Charles and Mr Zelenskyy shaking hands by the entrance to the royal home. The pair chatted briefly before heading inside, where they posed for more photographs. Their meeting lasted just under an hour, Sky News understands. A difficult week for Ukrainian president Mr Zelenskyy's difficult few days began on Friday, when his day at the White House with Mr Trump was cut short after their meeting in the Oval Office descended into a shouting match. The pair had been due to sign a minerals deal and hold a joint press conference - but both events were called off after their tense exchange, fuelled in part by comments from vice president JD Vance. Read more:What Ukrainians think of the Trump rowWhat did Vance say to Zelenskyy?UK, France and Ukraine work on peace plan As White House officials scrapped the day's schedule, Mr Trump described the meeting as \"very meaningful\" in a post on his Truth Social platform. He wrote: \"I have determined that President Zelenskyy is not ready for Peace if America is involved, because he feels our involvement gives him a big advantage in negotiations.\" Meanwhile, in an interview on Fox News, the Ukrainian president said the row was \"not good for both sides\" and refused to apologise. Mr Zelenskyy then jetted to the UK to meet Sir Keir and other world leaders."

        "Content": "\n          Political editor\n              @BethRigby\n  There was both symbolism and substance on Sunday as European leaders and NATO allies gathered in London to try to pick up the pieces after a shattering encounter in the Oval Office between the president of a superpower and a president at war. The symbolism was of European leaders and NATO allies gathering to stand shoulder to shoulder in a show of solidarity with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, after his mauling in the White House by US President Donald Trump and his vice president JD Vance. There was also real substance on Sunday as European and NATO allies committed to spending more on defence and stepping up to defend their borders against Russian aggression, with an eye on a US partner which, whatever Sir Keir Starmer might say, Europeans are not sure they can now rely on.  Ukraine talks latest - Zelenskyy to resign? EU Commission president Ursula von der Leyen, emerging from over two hours of talks, spoke of the EU plan - to be presented on Thursday - to increase defence spending. \"Member states need more fiscal space to do a surge in defence spending,\" she told reporters, adding Europe needed to turn Ukraine \"into a steel porcupine that is indigestible for potential invaders\". NATO secretary general Mark Rutte said he had heard new announcements from European leaders to ramp up defence spending. \n                  Hard power is the world's real currency once again - talking tough on defence won't be enough\n                 \n                  Trump and Zelenskyy's body language during White House row analysed\n                 \n                  Trump 100 Day 41: Is there any coming back from Trump Vs Zelenskyy?\n                 After decades of outsourcing its defence to the US and cashing in the post-Cold War peace dividend on health, education and welfare spending, Europe is all too aware that it has entered different times. Sir Keir has inserted himself into the heart of this endeavour as one of the few leaders - alongside perhaps President Emmanuel Macron of France and Georgia Meloni of Italy - capable of acting as the bridge between the Trump White House and the EU.  A Whitehall source said the prime minister \"feels the urgency and knows the unique role he can play\", adding that Sir Keir is \"very focused\". After the blow-up in the White House on Friday which saw the groundwork carefully laid by Sir Keir and Mr Macron to try to secure US security guarantees for Ukraine ripped up, the PM has spent the weekend trying to get it back on track with both Mr Zelenskyy and Mr Trump. I'm told it involves getting President Zelenskyy back to the table to do the deal, and then persuading European leaders to go beyond Twitter rhetoric and step up on defence spending, preparing now for a world with no US security guarantee for Europe, not just in Ukraine. Sir Keir told me clearly he does not view the US as an unreliable ally, and that the plan he, Mr Macron and others put together will be presented to Mr Trump and \"taken forward together\". But it is undeniable that Europe will have to step up. The PM spoke on Sunday of a \"coalition of the willing\", made up of nations prepared to defend a deal in Ukraine and to guarantee peace. \"Those willing will intensify planning now with real urgency,\" he said, confirming that the UK is \"prepared to back this with boots on the ground and planes in the air, together with others\". The hope is that the commitment from European allies will be enough for the US to provide the last resort backstop if Russian President Vladimir Putin decides to break the terms of any deal. It would involve intelligence and air cover but not boots on the ground. There is tentative optimism once more in Number 10, knocked sideways by its own diplomatic triumph on Thursday being followed by Mr Zelenskyy's Washington setback.  \"There is still a way to go, but we feel like we're making progress,\" one government source said, while another told me the PM was \"pleased at the quality of the discussion at the summit and feels like things are moving forward\". When I asked another if they were confident they could bind President Trump back in, they said they were \"hopeful, not confident\". Of course, getting talks back on track is only the first hurdle of many. Even if Sir Keir and Mr Macron can patch things up with Mr Trump and Mr Zelenskyy, what might this peace deal look like, and crucially will Russia, perhaps emboldened by the fracturing of the Western alliance, be less minded to deal or make undeliverable demands? The PM said on Sunday that it was up to Europeans to set the parameters of a peace deal rather than allow Russia to \"dictate the terms of any security guarantees before we've even got to a deal\". ð Follow Trump 100 on your podcast app ð Mr Trump has offered Mr Putin one concession by ruling out Ukraine joining NATO, reversing the stance adopted by his predecessor, Joe Biden. He also batted away President Zelenskyy's demand that Ukraine's borders be restored to pre-conflict lines, saying he would freeze the borders at the point of any ceasefire, meaning Moscow would keep hold of the 20% of Ukrainian territory it had taken since 2022. Read more:'Coalition of the willing' to back UkraineHard power is the real currency againStarmer's place as Trump's new BFF tested Last week, Mr Trump appeared less clear on this, telling reporters in the Oval Office for Sir Keir's visit that he would get back Ukrainian land. In short, even if the Europeans can patch up relations between President Zelenskyy and President Trump, there is an even more complex negotiation to then have with President Putin. So, there is still quite some distance to travel, but the prime minister closes this week of intense, and fraught diplomacy, with a sense that the UK and other key partners are back on track and, as President Zelenskyy returned to the frontline in Ukraine on Sunday evening, European leaders know they have to deploy all the hard and soft power they have to try to end this war."

        "Content": "Hamas has rejected an Israeli request to extend the first phase of the Gaza ceasefire, a senior official has said. The militant group will only release the remaining Israeli hostages under the terms of the already agreed-upon phased deal, Mahmoud Mardawi told Al Jazeera on Sunday. Under a plan put forward by US Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff, which Israel has accepted, the first phase of the ceasefire deal would continue through Ramadan and Passover, or until 20 April. Ukraine talks latest - Zelenskyy to resign?  Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office said earlier Israel would stop all goods and supplies into Gaza after claiming Hamas was refusing to \"accept the Witkoff outline for continuing the talks, which Israel agreed to\". Hamas condemned the decision to block aid to the enclave, calling it \"a war crime and a blatant attack\" on a truce that took a year of negotiations before taking hold in January. The foreign minister of Egypt, a key mediator in the conflict, said Israel's actions were an attempt to use \"starvation as a weapon\" and \"a flagrant and clear violation of humanitarian law\". \n                  Trump shares AI video of Gaza vision featuring golden statues, bearded belly dancers and Netanyahu on a sunbed\n                 \n                  Operation Iron Wall: West Bank areas 'turning into mini-Gaza' as Israeli troops bulldoze homes\n                 \n                  Netanyahu signals moving ahead with Trump's Gaza plan as Israel receives unblocked US shipment of heavy bombs\n                 Saudi Arabia called Israel's decision \"a tool of extortion\". The first phase of the ceasefire, which expired on Saturday, saw a surge in humanitarian aid after months of growing hunger. Negotiations on the second phase were meant to start a month ago but haven't begun. Israel warned of \"additional consequences\" if Hamas refused to agree to its proposal.  Under the US proposal, Hamas would release half the hostages on the first day and the rest when an agreement is reached on a permanent ceasefire, Mr Netanyahu said. Hamas currently holds 59 hostages, 35 of them believed to be dead, after taking an estimated 250 people captive back to Gaza after its 7 October 2023 raid on southern Israel in which 1,200 people were killed. Israel's military counter-offensive has killed over 48,000 Palestinians, according to Palestinian health officials, displaced an estimated 90% of Gaza's population and destroyed the territory's infrastructure and health system. Washington made no immediate comment but Mr Netanyahu said Israel is fully coordinated with the Trump administration and the ceasefire will only continue as long as Hamas keeps releasing hostages. The International Committee of the Red Cross warned that \"any unraveling of the forward momentum created over the last six weeks risks plunging people back into despair\". The ceasefire has saved countless lives, the humanitarian organisation said.

Most of Gaza's two million-plus residents depend on international aid because of the privations caused by the war. About 600 aid trucks had entered daily since the ceasefire began on 19 January, easing fears of famine raised by international experts. Medical charity MSF accused Israel of using aid as a bargaining chip, something it described as \"unacceptable\" and \"outrageous\"."

The Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) said it wants to look into how video-sharing app TikTok uses information from users aged 13 to 17 to deliver content recommendations to them. The investigations into online forum site Reddit and image-sharing site Imgur will focus on their use of age assurance measures, such as how they estimate and verify children's ages, and how they use their personal information. The regulator is taking action amid growing concerns about how social media platforms use data generated by children's online activity in their recommendation algorithms - and the potential for young people to be served harmful or inappropriate content as a result. TikTok's algorithm powers the For You Page, which recommends videos to users based on the content they engage with on the app. A study previously found the app was suggesting eating disorder and self-harm content to some new teen accounts within minutes.

        "Content": "\n          Political reporter\n              @alexrogerssky\n  Sir Keir Starmer has suggested a coalition of European allies could step up and defend a potential deal for Ukraine to \"guarantee the peace\". The prime minister indicated some EU nations could be prepared to increase defence spending to protect any peace deal that is agreed between Ukraine and Russia. But speaking at a news conference following the summit of EU leaders in central London, Sir Keir acknowledged that no such coalition had yet been formed - and warned that \"not every nation will feel able to contribute\". Instead, he said \"those willing\" - though he did not state which countries this included - would \"intensify planning now with real urgency\". Politics latest: Zelenskyy meets King at Sandringham  In a sign this could see EU member states send their own troops to Ukraine, he added: \"The UK is prepared to back this with boots on the ground and planes in the air, together with others. Europe must do the heavy lifting.\" The summit of EU leaders, along with Canada and Turkey, had been planned for over a week but took on an added urgency following the disastrous meeting between President Trump and Volodymyr Zelenskyy at the White House on Friday. \n                  'We can still trust the Americans', minister says despite breakdown between Trump and Zelenskyy\n                 \n                  Will ministerial resignation dent Starmer's post-Trump high?\n                 \n                  Day 40: Charmer Starmer plays his Trump card \n                 In front of the world's cameras, Mr Trump accused the Ukrainian president - who is met with the King at Sandringham - of \"disrespecting\" the United States and \"gambling with World War Three\" when he expressed scepticism that Vladimir Putin cold be trusted to honour ceasefire agreements. The diplomatic breakdown intensified fears among some Western leaders that the United States could not be relied upon to support Ukraine militarily, with Kaja Kallas, the EU high representative for foreign affairs and security policy, posting on social media: \"Today, it became clear that the free world needs a new leader. It's up to us, Europeans, to take this challenge.\" Sir Keir has been positioning himself as a peace broker between the US and Europe following Mr Trump's ascension to the White House, but his task was made more pressing following the clash in the Oval Office - which he earlier admitted he found \"uncomfortable\". 'Our countries are intertwined' However, answering a question from Sky News' political editor Beth Rigby, the prime minister rejected the claim that the US was no longer a reliable partner. \"I do not accept that the US is an unreliable ally,\" he said. \"The US has been a reliable ally to the UK for many, many decades and continues to be. There are no two countries as closely aligned as our two countries. Our defence, our security and intelligence is intertwined.\" Security and Defence Editor The use of the term \"coalition of the willing\" to describe the nations that agree to support an international force to help protect any ceasefire deal in Ukraine is interesting and notable.\n\n It could perhaps be an attempt by Sir Keir Starmer to appeal to an American audience as this was the phrase the United States used for its \"coalition of the willing\" to invade Iraq more than two decades ago.\n\n That intervention ended in disaster, triggering a bloody insurgency and locking the US and its allies into a costly war, despite the successful toppling of Saddam Hussein.\n\n But reviving the words \"coalition of the willing\" will - if nothing else - remind Washington that London was its biggest and strongest backer when it turned to allies to back its 2003 invasion.\n\n He confirmed the UK, France and Ukraine would work on a peace plan that will be presented to the US and that the White House would continue to be part of the process. \"The discussions we've had today, particularly the coalition of the willing, is on the basis that this is a plan that we will work with the US and that it will have U.S. backing,\" he said. \"That is the purpose of the plan and that is why I spoke to President Trump last night before we developed the work on this plan.\" Asked whether he had been trying to persuade other nations to join the so-called \"coalition of the willing\" today, Sir Keir said \"a number of countries\" had indicated that they wanted to be \"part of the plan that we are developing\". \"I'll leave them to make their own statements about exactly how they want to make that contribution,\" he said. \"But we've been able to move that forward. I accept, without criticism and with respect, the position of other countries that may not feel that they want to contribute in that way - but I strongly feel that unless some move forward, we will stay in the position we're in and not be able to move forward.\" Extra Â£1.6bn for Ukraine Elsewhere in the news conference, Sir Keir announced a new deal which will allow Ukraine to use Â£1.6bn of UK export finance to buy 5,000 more air defence missiles. The prime minister said the move will create jobs in the UK's defence sector and would also be \"vital for protecting critical infrastructure and strengthen Ukraine\". It comes on top of the UK announcing that it would increase defence spending to 2.5% of GDP by 2027, from the current 2.3%. Chancellor Rachel Reeves also announced that the UK would give Ukraine an extra Â£2.26bn for its war effort, funded by the profits made from hundreds of billions of dollars' worth of Russian sovereign assets that Western nations have frozen since the start of the full-scale war in February 2022.

She said she will present a plan to \"rearm\" Europe in the coming days. Speaking to broadcasters outside Lancaster House following the conclusion of Sunday's summit, Ms Von der Leyen said \"comprehensive security guarantees\" from Europe as well as the United States were needed. She said \"we have to put Ukraine in a position of strength\" so that \"it has the means to fortify and protect itself\" in economic and military terms. \"Therefore the focus is not only on the military supply but also. for example, securing their energy system,\" she added."

        "Content": "The family of pop star Liam Payne has criticised the media for causing \"indescribable, lasting damage\" in the wake of his death. The singer, 31, died in October last year, after falling from a hotel balcony in Argentina. He was honoured with a video montage, played at Saturday night's BRIT awards, celebrating his legacy - with clips including his time on X-Factor and during his time with One Direction. The band won seven BRIT awards before they split in 2016. In a statement, released to the media after the tribute was played, his family called the death an \"unspeakable tragedy\". The family also criticised the \"attention and speculation\" in the press that caused \"indescribable, lasting damage on the family, particularly on Liam's son, who is trying to process emotions which no seven-year-old should have to experience\". It said the family accepted the Court of Appeal's decision to drop all charges in relation to Payne's death. Charges were dropped against three defendants: Payne's friend Roger Nores, who had accompanied him during his trip to Buenos Aires; Gilda Martin, the manager of the Casa Sur Palermo Hotel where Payne died; and Esteban Grassi, the hotel's main receptionist. Two others are still facing prosecution for allegedly supplying Payne with drugs. Supplying drugs in Argentina carries a sentence of up to 15 years in prison. Toxicology tests revealed that before his death, he had traces of alcohol, cocaine, and a prescription antidepressant in his body. A postmortem ruled his cause of death as \"polytrauma\" from multiple injuries and internal and external bleeding. Liamâs death was an unspeakable tragedy. This is a time of tremendous grief and pain for those who knew and loved him. âLiam ought to have had a long life ahead of him. Instead, Bear has lost his father, Geoff and Karen have lost their son, Ruth and Nicola have lost their brother and all of Liamâs friends and fans have lost someone they held very dear. We understand that the investigation into Liamâs death was absolutely necessary and the family recognises the work done by the Argentinian authorities. However, the family accepts the Court of Appealâs decision to drop all charges. The constant media attention and speculation which has accompanied the process has exacted indescribable, lasting damage on the family, particularly on Liamâs son, who is trying to process emotions which no seven-year-old should have to experience. The family has always wished for privacy to grieve and asks that they be given the space and time to do so. This weekend, at the Brit Awards, Liam was remembered for his phenomenal contribution to British music and for his wider, positive impact on millions of adoring fans the world over. We joined in that celebration of his life and will forever remember the joy that his music brought to the world. Liam, you are so loved and missed. 'Beautiful' Brits tribute After the video aired, Payne's former band member Louis Tomlinson thanked the BRIT Awards and said: \"Beautiful tribute. Miss you always, brother x.\" Awards host Jack Whitehall introduced the tribute to the singer and said: \"He achieved so much in the short time that he was on this earth, and was not only a supremely gifted musician but an incredibly kind soul who touched the lives of everyone he came into contact with. \"We have so many amazing memories with Liam here at The BRITs. So, tonight we celebrate his legacy and look back and remember, the remarkable Liam Payne.\""

        "Content": "A British-Israeli woman who was kidnapped by Hamas and held hostage for 271 days in Gaza has undergone a series of operations for wounds she suffered on the day she was taken captive. Emily Damari was at home on Kibbutz Kfar Aza on 7 October 2023 when Hamas launched its massacre in Israel, killing 62 residents in the community and kidnapping 19 others. The 28-year-old was shot in her left hand and right leg at close range, causing her to lose two fingers and leaving her with injuries to her leg that impair her movement. Speaking before a series of operations in Israel, she said: \"I have fully embraced my hand, my pain, and my scars. To me they represent freedom, hope and strength.\" Afterwards she said the surgery \"went much better than expected\". She added: \"My recovery will take time and my hand will never fully recover, but the intense pain I had for a year and a half due to the nerves being sewn together after my first operation in Shifa Hospital in Gaza is now no longer with me and the large scar, that was caused by an open, festering wound that did not heal for four months because of the conditions of the tunnels I was held in, is now looking better. \"After my recuperation, with the help of physiotherapy, I hope to be able to use my hand much more effectively than was previously possible, before the surgery.\" Ms Damari's mother, Mandy Damari, said her daughter had been \"sewn up like a pin cushion\" by Hamas, leaving her with significant pain in her hand and leg. She said Hamas did not provide any medical aid except for an out-of-date bottle of iodine during her daughter's time in captivity. \"It is nothing short of a miracle that she did not contract a life-threatening infection,\" she added. Ms Damari said she was kept in Hamas's network of underground tunnels with no sanitation or access to clean water. \"It was shocking but not surprising to see how emaciated some of the other hostages were when they came out. Hamas has created hell on Earth, the conditions down there are unimaginable,\" she added. Prime Minister Keir Starmer has invited Ms Damari and her mother to visit No 10 on their next visit to the UK and fans of her favourite football club Tottenham Hotspur have offered her matchday tickets.

His opponent, Lamont Roach, said the knee position should have counted as a \"knockdown\". Had it been, Davis would have lost a point and Roach would have won their bout in New York, leading to Davis's first career defeat. But the fight was scored as a majority draw, meaning that Davis - nicknamed Tank - held onto his belt. One judge gave the contest to Davis 115-113, the other two scoring it 114-114. Davis willingly took a knee near his corner in the ninth round before leaning over the ropes so his team could towel off the area around an eye. He said grease had got into the eye after having his hair done a few days before the bout. Referee Steve Willis did not count it as a knockdown, as it should be when a knee hits the canvas. Roach commented: \"It should have been a knockdown. If that was knockdown, I win the fight. \"He's saying grease got in his eye, but if he takes a knee and the ref starts counting, it should be a knockdown.\" Read more:Israel stopping all goods and supplies into GazaSecond-ever privately funded space craft touches down on moon Other boxers were surprised, too.

        "Content": " Volodymyr Zelenskyy has said he is \"exchangeable\" for Ukrainian membership of NATO, indicating he would be prepared to step down as president if his country was allowed to join the military alliance. He also suggested he was ready to sign a minerals deal with the US that was put on hold after his heated meeting with Donald Trump in the Oval Office on Friday. Mr Zelenskyy was speaking to reporters on Sunday evening after earlier talks with other world leaders at a London summit hosted by Sir Keir Starmer, who suggested a coalition of European allies could step up to defend Ukraine and \"guarantee the peace\". Latest updates on Ukraine's future Asked by Sky News' lead world news presenter Yalda Hakim if he could quit in the event his country becomes a NATO member, he said: \"I am exchangeable for NATO.\" The Ukraine president added: \"I have said that I am exchanging for NATO membership, then it means I have fulfilled my mission. NATO means I have fulfilled my mission.\" But, he continued: \"To change me, it will not be easy because it is not enough to simply hold elections. You would need to prevent me from participating.

His comments at Stansted Airport come after Republicans including senator Lindsay Graham and speaker Mike Johnson suggested he should step down from his position following the fiery White House exchange with President Trump. Mr Zelenskyy spoke to journalists shortly before leaving the UK on Sunday evening. In response to a question from Yalda Hakim, Mr Zelenskyy said: \"I can give [Lindsay Graham] citizenship of Ukraine and he will become a citizen of our country. \"And then his voice will start to gain weight, and I will hear him as a citizen of Ukraine on the topic of who must be the president.\" \"The president of Ukraine will have to be chosen not in Lindsay Graham's home but in Ukraine,\" he added. Mr Zelenskyy confirmed there has been communication between Ukraine and the Trump administration since the clash on Friday, but \"not on my level\". Mr Graham - a Republican senator and close Trump ally - labelled the meeting a \"complete, utter disaster\" at a press briefing on Friday.  Asked whether Mr Zelenskyy should step aside, he said: \"He either needs to resign or send somebody over that we can do business with, or he needs to change.\" After the London summit on Sunday, the prime minister unveiled a four-step plan discussed by leaders, including a pledge to \"develop a coalition of the willing\" to defend a deal in Ukraine and guarantee a peace settlement. Sir Keir said Europe \"must do the heavy lifting\", and the UK \"is prepared to back this with boots on the ground and planes in the air, together with others\". He also announced a new deal which will allow Ukraine to use Â£1.6bn of UK export finance to buy 5,000 more air defence missiles. Zelenskyy's meeting with the King The Ukrainian president's 90-minute sit down with the media came shortly after he wrapped up a tough week with a visit to see the King at Sandringham. Mr Zelenskyy flew to Norfolk in a helicopter on Sunday afternoon after attending the security summit in central London. People - some holding Ukraine flags - gathered outside Sandringham to try to witness his arrival. A military helicopter could be seen flying low before descending over the estate. Pictures released after the meeting show Charles and Mr Zelenskyy shaking hands by the entrance to the royal home. The pair chatted briefly before heading inside, where they posed for more photographs. Their meeting lasted just under an hour, Sky News understands. A difficult week for Ukrainian president Mr Zelenskyy's difficult few days began on Friday, when his day at the White House with Mr Trump was cut short after their meeting in the Oval Office descended into a shouting match. The pair had been due to sign a minerals deal and hold a joint press conference - but both events were called off after their tense exchange, fuelled in part by comments from vice president JD Vance. Read more:What Ukrainians think of the Trump rowWhat did Vance say to Zelenskyy?UK, France and Ukraine work on peace plan As White House officials scrapped the day's schedule, Mr Trump described the meeting as \"very meaningful\" in a post on his Truth Social platform.

Mr Zelenskyy then jetted to the UK to meet Sir Keir and other world leaders."

        "Content": "\n          Political reporter\n              @alexrogerssky\n  Sir Keir Starmer has suggested a coalition of European allies could step up and defend a potential deal for Ukraine to \"guarantee the peace\". The prime minister indicated some EU nations could be prepared to increase defence spending to protect any peace deal that is agreed between Ukraine and Russia. But speaking at a news conference following the summit of EU leaders in central London, Sir Keir acknowledged that no such coalition had yet been formed - and warned that \"not every nation will feel able to contribute\". Instead, he said \"those willing\" - though he did not state which countries this included - would \"intensify planning now with real urgency\". Politics latest: Zelenskyy meets King at Sandringham  In a sign this could see EU member states send their own troops to Ukraine, he added: \"The UK is prepared to back this with boots on the ground and planes in the air, together with others. Europe must do the heavy lifting.\" The summit of EU leaders, along with Canada and Turkey, had been planned for over a week but took on an added urgency following the disastrous meeting between President Trump and Volodymyr Zelenskyy at the White House on Friday. \n                  'We can still trust the Americans', minister says despite breakdown between Trump and Zelenskyy\n                 \n                  Will ministerial resignation dent Starmer's post-Trump high?\n                 \n                  Day 40: Charmer Starmer plays his Trump card \n                 In front of the world's cameras, Mr Trump accused the Ukrainian president - who is met with the King at Sandringham - of \"disrespecting\" the United States and \"gambling with World War Three\" when he expressed scepticism that Vladimir Putin cold be trusted to honour ceasefire agreements. The diplomatic breakdown intensified fears among some Western leaders that the United States could not be relied upon to support Ukraine militarily, with Kaja Kallas, the EU high representative for foreign affairs and security policy, posting on social media: \"Today, it became clear that the free world needs a new leader. It's up to us, Europeans, to take this challenge.\" Sir Keir has been positioning himself as a peace broker between the US and Europe following Mr Trump's ascension to the White House, but his task was made more pressing following the clash in the Oval Office - which he earlier admitted he found \"uncomfortable\". 'Our countries are intertwined' However, answering a question from Sky News' political editor Beth Rigby, the prime minister rejected the claim that the US was no longer a reliable partner. \"I do not accept that the US is an unreliable ally,\" he said. \"The US has been a reliable ally to the UK for many, many decades and continues to be. There are no two countries as closely aligned as our two countries. Our defence, our security and intelligence is intertwined.\" Security and Defence Editor The use of the term \"coalition of the willing\" to describe the nations that agree to support an international force to help protect any ceasefire deal in Ukraine is interesting and notable.\n\n It could perhaps be an attempt by Sir Keir Starmer to appeal to an American audience as this was the phrase the United States used for its \"coalition of the willing\" to invade Iraq more than two decades ago.\n\n That intervention ended in disaster, triggering a bloody insurgency and locking the US and its allies into a costly war, despite the successful toppling of Saddam Hussein.\n\n But reviving the words \"coalition of the willing\" will - if nothing else - remind Washington that London was its biggest and strongest backer when it turned to allies to back its 2003 invasion.\n\n He confirmed the UK, France and Ukraine would work on a peace plan that will be presented to the US and that the White House would continue to be part of the process. \"The discussions we've had today, particularly the coalition of the willing, is on the basis that this is a plan that we will work with the US and that it will have U.S. backing,\" he said. \"That is the purpose of the plan and that is why I spoke to President Trump last night before we developed the work on this plan.\" Asked whether he had been trying to persuade other nations to join the so-called \"coalition of the willing\" today, Sir Keir said \"a number of countries\" had indicated that they wanted to be \"part of the plan that we are developing\". \"I'll leave them to make their own statements about exactly how they want to make that contribution,\" he said. \"But we've been able to move that forward. I accept, without criticism and with respect, the position of other countries that may not feel that they want to contribute in that way - but I strongly feel that unless some move forward, we will stay in the position we're in and not be able to move forward.\" Extra Â£1.6bn for Ukraine Elsewhere in the news conference, Sir Keir announced a new deal which will allow Ukraine to use Â£1.6bn of UK export finance to buy 5,000 more air defence missiles. The prime minister said the move will create jobs in the UK's defence sector and would also be \"vital for protecting critical infrastructure and strengthen Ukraine\". It comes on top of the UK announcing that it would increase defence spending to 2.5% of GDP by 2027, from the current 2.3%. Chancellor Rachel Reeves also announced that the UK would give Ukraine an extra Â£2.26bn for its war effort, funded by the profits made from hundreds of billions of dollars' worth of Russian sovereign assets that Western nations have frozen since the start of the full-scale war in February 2022.

She said she will present a plan to \"rearm\" Europe in the coming days. Speaking to broadcasters outside Lancaster House following the conclusion of Sunday's summit, Ms Von der Leyen said \"comprehensive security guarantees\" from Europe as well as the United States were needed. She said \"we have to put Ukraine in a position of strength\" so that \"it has the means to fortify and protect itself\" in economic and military terms. \"Therefore the focus is not only on the military supply but also. for example, securing their energy system,\" she added."

        "Content": "\n          Security and Defence Editor\n              @haynesdeborah\n Remarkable â and relatively speaking a blessing â that the wake-up call for Britain to take defence seriously again did not come in the form of a military attack on UK soil, but instead was triggered by the verbal assault of Ukraine's wartime leader by a sitting US president. The lack of any physical destruction on British streets, though, should fool no one in government or wider society that the framework of security that has protected the country and its allies since the end of the Second World War is not at best cracked and at worst shattered. Instead, check out one of the latest posts by Elon Musk, Donald Trump's \"disrupter-in-chief\". He used his social media site X to say \"I agree\" with a call for the United States to leave NATO - a transatlantic alliance, and the bedrock of European security, that the new administration had until now continued to back at least in public. It is yet another example of escalating hostility from the new Trump White House - which has sided with Russia against Ukraine, lashed out at its European partners over their values, and even suggested absorbing Canada as the 51st American state. The alarming mood-change by a nation that is meant to be a friend surely demands an equally dramatic shift in approach by NATO's 30 European allies and their Canadian partner. Rather than stating the obvious - that American support can no longer be taken for granted - they should instead be actively adapting to a world in which it fundamentally no longer exists.  Make no mistake, this would be a daunting and humbling prospect - perhaps too awful even to contemplate, in particular for the UK, which has tied itself militarily so closely to the US for pretty much everything from intelligence sharing and technology to nuclear weapons. Britain is not alone. All European militaries, as well as Canada, to a greater or lesser extent rely heavily on their more powerful American partners. Breaking that dependency would require a rapid expansion in military capabilities and capacity across the continent, as well as a huge effort to build up the defence industrial base required to produce weapons at scale and exploit emerging technologies. Sir Keir Starmer - who is hosting a Ukraine summit of allies on Sunday - has rightly adopted the UK's natural position of leadership in Europe in the wake of Donald Trump's extraordinary hostility towards Volodymyr Zelenskyy. He gave the embattled Ukrainian president a warm embrace on Saturday when the two met at Downing Street. Britain is one of Europe's two nuclear-armed states, a powerful voice within NATO, and a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council.  But talking tough on defence and the need to support Ukraine as the US steps back is no longer enough in a world where hard power is the only real currency once again. A pledge by the prime minister to increase defence spending to 2.5% of national income by 2027 and to 3% in the next parliament is of course a step in the right direction. Yet unless it is accompanied by much greater speed and urgency coupled with a genuinely generational shift in the entire country's approach to national security then it will go down in history as the headline-grabbing but otherwise empty gesture of a government that has forgotten what it means to be ready to fight wars. Anneliese Dodds, who quit as international development secretary on Thursday over the prime minister's plan to fund his increase in defence spending with a raid on the overseas aid budget, summed up the challenge well in her resignation letter. She wrote that she supported the plan to lift the defence budget but said even 3% \"may only be the start, and it will be impossible to raise the substantial resources needed just through tactical cuts to public spending\". She added: \"These are unprecedented times, when strategic decisions for the sake of our country's security cannot be ducked.\" Read more:Starmer asks leaders to unite ahead of Ukraine summitIsrael agrees to Gaza ceasefire extension  Ms Dodds is right. It is no longer good enough to treat defence, deterrence and wider national resilience as a niche subject that is delivered by an increasingly small, professional military. Rather, it should once again be at the heart of the thinking of all government departments - from the Treasury and business to health and education - led by the prime minister, his national security adviser and the cabinet secretary. This is not something new. It was normal during the Cold War years when, after two world wars, the whole country was acutely aware of the need to maintain costly but credible armed forces and a population that was ready to play its part in a crisis."

        "Content": "The family of pop star Liam Payne has criticised the media for causing \"indescribable, lasting damage\" in the wake of his death. The singer, 31, died in October last year, after falling from a hotel balcony in Argentina. He was honoured with a video montage, played at Saturday night's BRIT awards, celebrating his legacy - with clips including his time on X-Factor and during his time with One Direction. The band won seven BRIT awards before they split in 2016. In a statement, released to the media after the tribute was played, his family called the death an \"unspeakable tragedy\". The family also criticised the \"attention and speculation\" in the press that caused \"indescribable, lasting damage on the family, particularly on Liam's son, who is trying to process emotions which no seven-year-old should have to experience\". It said the family accepted the Court of Appeal's decision to drop all charges in relation to Payne's death. Charges were dropped against three defendants: Payne's friend Roger Nores, who had accompanied him during his trip to Buenos Aires; Gilda Martin, the manager of the Casa Sur Palermo Hotel where Payne died; and Esteban Grassi, the hotel's main receptionist. Two others are still facing prosecution for allegedly supplying Payne with drugs. Supplying drugs in Argentina carries a sentence of up to 15 years in prison. Toxicology tests revealed that before his death, he had traces of alcohol, cocaine, and a prescription antidepressant in his body. A postmortem ruled his cause of death as \"polytrauma\" from multiple injuries and internal and external bleeding. Liamâs death was an unspeakable tragedy. This is a time of tremendous grief and pain for those who knew and loved him. âLiam ought to have had a long life ahead of him. Instead, Bear has lost his father, Geoff and Karen have lost their son, Ruth and Nicola have lost their brother and all of Liamâs friends and fans have lost someone they held very dear. We understand that the investigation into Liamâs death was absolutely necessary and the family recognises the work done by the Argentinian authorities. However, the family accepts the Court of Appealâs decision to drop all charges. The constant media attention and speculation which has accompanied the process has exacted indescribable, lasting damage on the family, particularly on Liamâs son, who is trying to process emotions which no seven-year-old should have to experience. The family has always wished for privacy to grieve and asks that they be given the space and time to do so. This weekend, at the Brit Awards, Liam was remembered for his phenomenal contribution to British music and for his wider, positive impact on millions of adoring fans the world over. We joined in that celebration of his life and will forever remember the joy that his music brought to the world. Liam, you are so loved and missed. 'Beautiful' Brits tribute After the video aired, Payne's former band member Louis Tomlinson thanked the BRIT Awards and said: \"Beautiful tribute. Miss you always, brother x.\" Awards host Jack Whitehall introduced the tribute to the singer and said: \"He achieved so much in the short time that he was on this earth, and was not only a supremely gifted musician but an incredibly kind soul who touched the lives of everyone he came into contact with. \"We have so many amazing memories with Liam here at The BRITs. So, tonight we celebrate his legacy and look back and remember, the remarkable Liam Payne.\""

        "Content": "TikTok, Reddit and Imgur are to be investigated by the UK's data protection watchdog over how they use teenage users' personal information.  The Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) said it wants to look into how video-sharing app TikTok uses information from users aged 13 to 17 to deliver content recommendations to them. The investigations into online forum site Reddit and image-sharing site Imgur will focus on their use of age assurance measures, such as how they estimate and verify children's ages, and how they use their personal information. The regulator is taking action amid growing concerns about how social media platforms use data generated by children's online activity in their recommendation algorithms - and the potential for young people to be served harmful or inappropriate content as a result. TikTok's algorithm powers the For You Page, which recommends videos to users based on the content they engage with on the app. A study previously found the app was suggesting eating disorder and self-harm content to some new teen accounts within minutes.

Public transport campaigners cautioned that the fare hikes will \"pile further misery on hard-pressed households\" as some commuters will have to pay hundreds of pounds more per year for travel. Transport Secretary Heidi Alexander acknowledged passenger frustration. The UK government set the 4.6% cap for England's increase in regulated fares. This will include season tickets on most commuter journeys, some off-peak return tickets on long-distance routes and flexible tickets for travel around major cities.

He also suggested he was ready to sign a minerals deal with the US that was put on hold after his heated meeting with Donald Trump in the Oval Office on Friday. Mr Zelenskyy was speaking to reporters on Sunday evening after earlier talks with other world leaders at a London summit hosted by Sir Keir Starmer, who suggested a coalition of European allies could step up to defend Ukraine and \"guarantee the peace\". Latest updates on Ukraine's future Asked by Sky News' lead world news presenter Yalda Hakim if he could quit in the event his country becomes a NATO member, he said: \"I am exchangeable for NATO.\" The Ukraine president added: \"I have said that I am exchanging for NATO membership, then it means I have fulfilled my mission.

His comments at Stansted Airport come after Republicans including senator Lindsay Graham and speaker Mike Johnson suggested he should step down from his position following the fiery White House exchange with President Trump. Mr Zelenskyy spoke to journalists shortly before leaving the UK on Sunday evening. In response to a question from Yalda Hakim, Mr Zelenskyy said: \"I can give [Lindsay Graham] citizenship of Ukraine and he will become a citizen of our country. \"And then his voice will start to gain weight, and I will hear him as a citizen of Ukraine on the topic of who must be the president.\" \"The president of Ukraine will have to be chosen not in Lindsay Graham's home but in Ukraine,\" he added. Mr Zelenskyy confirmed there has been communication between Ukraine and the Trump administration since the clash on Friday, but \"not on my level\". Mr Graham - a Republican senator and close Trump ally - labelled the meeting a \"complete, utter disaster\" at a press briefing on Friday.  Asked whether Mr Zelenskyy should step aside, he said: \"He either needs to resign or send somebody over that we can do business with, or he needs to change.\" After the London summit on Sunday, the prime minister unveiled a four-step plan discussed by leaders, including a pledge to \"develop a coalition of the willing\" to defend a deal in Ukraine and guarantee a peace settlement. Sir Keir said Europe \"must do the heavy lifting\", and the UK \"is prepared to back this with boots on the ground and planes in the air, together with others\". He also announced a new deal which will allow Ukraine to use Â£1.6bn of UK export finance to buy 5,000 more air defence missiles. Zelenskyy's meeting with the King The Ukrainian president's 90-minute sit down with the media came shortly after he wrapped up a tough week with a visit to see the King at Sandringham. Mr Zelenskyy flew to Norfolk in a helicopter on Sunday afternoon after attending the security summit in central London. People - some holding Ukraine flags - gathered outside Sandringham to try to witness his arrival. A military helicopter could be seen flying low before descending over the estate. Pictures released after the meeting show Charles and Mr Zelenskyy shaking hands by the entrance to the royal home. The pair chatted briefly before heading inside, where they posed for more photographs. Their meeting lasted just under an hour, Sky News understands. A difficult week for Ukrainian president Mr Zelenskyy's difficult few days began on Friday, when his day at the White House with Mr Trump was cut short after their meeting in the Oval Office descended into a shouting match. The pair had been due to sign a minerals deal and hold a joint press conference - but both events were called off after their tense exchange, fuelled in part by comments from vice president JD Vance.

Mr Zelenskyy then jetted to the UK to meet Sir Keir and other world leaders."

But Democratic senator Amy Klobuchar told ABC she was \"appalled\" by the clash in the Oval Office and said she met Mr Zelenskyy before he went to the White House on Friday and he had been excited to sign an expected minerals deal. \"There is still an opening here\" for a peace deal, she said.

        "Content": "\n          Political editor\n              @BethRigby\n  There was both symbolism and substance on Sunday as European leaders and NATO allies gathered in London to try to pick up the pieces after a shattering encounter in the Oval Office between the president of a superpower and a president at war. The symbolism was of European leaders and NATO allies gathering to stand shoulder to shoulder in a show of solidarity with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, after his mauling in the White House by US President Donald Trump and his vice president JD Vance. There was also real substance on Sunday as European and NATO allies committed to spending more on defence and stepping up to defend their borders against Russian aggression, with an eye on a US partner which, whatever Sir Keir Starmer might say, Europeans are not sure they can now rely on.  Ukraine talks latest - Zelenskyy to resign? EU Commission president Ursula von der Leyen, emerging from over two hours of talks, spoke of the EU plan - to be presented on Thursday - to increase defence spending. \"Member states need more fiscal space to do a surge in defence spending,\" she told reporters, adding Europe needed to turn Ukraine \"into a steel porcupine that is indigestible for potential invaders\". NATO secretary general Mark Rutte said he had heard new announcements from European leaders to ramp up defence spending. \n                  Hard power is the world's real currency once again - talking tough on defence won't be enough\n                 \n                  Trump and Zelenskyy's body language during White House row analysed\n                 \n                  Trump 100 Day 41: Is there any coming back from Trump Vs Zelenskyy?\n                 After decades of outsourcing its defence to the US and cashing in the post-Cold War peace dividend on health, education and welfare spending, Europe is all too aware that it has entered different times. Sir Keir has inserted himself into the heart of this endeavour as one of the few leaders - alongside perhaps President Emmanuel Macron of France and Georgia Meloni of Italy - capable of acting as the bridge between the Trump White House and the EU.  A Whitehall source said the prime minister \"feels the urgency and knows the unique role he can play\", adding that Sir Keir is \"very focused\". After the blow-up in the White House on Friday which saw the groundwork carefully laid by Sir Keir and Mr Macron to try to secure US security guarantees for Ukraine ripped up, the PM has spent the weekend trying to get it back on track with both Mr Zelenskyy and Mr Trump. I'm told it involves getting President Zelenskyy back to the table to do the deal, and then persuading European leaders to go beyond Twitter rhetoric and step up on defence spending, preparing now for a world with no US security guarantee for Europe, not just in Ukraine. Sir Keir told me clearly he does not view the US as an unreliable ally, and that the plan he, Mr Macron and others put together will be presented to Mr Trump and \"taken forward together\". But it is undeniable that Europe will have to step up. The PM spoke on Sunday of a \"coalition of the willing\", made up of nations prepared to defend a deal in Ukraine and to guarantee peace. \"Those willing will intensify planning now with real urgency,\" he said, confirming that the UK is \"prepared to back this with boots on the ground and planes in the air, together with others\". The hope is that the commitment from European allies will be enough for the US to provide the last resort backstop if Russian President Vladimir Putin decides to break the terms of any deal. It would involve intelligence and air cover but not boots on the ground. There is tentative optimism once more in Number 10, knocked sideways by its own diplomatic triumph on Thursday being followed by Mr Zelenskyy's Washington setback.  \"There is still a way to go, but we feel like we're making progress,\" one government source said, while another told me the PM was \"pleased at the quality of the discussion at the summit and feels like things are moving forward\". When I asked another if they were confident they could bind President Trump back in, they said they were \"hopeful, not confident\". Of course, getting talks back on track is only the first hurdle of many. Even if Sir Keir and Mr Macron can patch things up with Mr Trump and Mr Zelenskyy, what might this peace deal look like, and crucially will Russia, perhaps emboldened by the fracturing of the Western alliance, be less minded to deal or make undeliverable demands? The PM said on Sunday that it was up to Europeans to set the parameters of a peace deal rather than allow Russia to \"dictate the terms of any security guarantees before we've even got to a deal\". ð Follow Trump 100 on your podcast app ð Mr Trump has offered Mr Putin one concession by ruling out Ukraine joining NATO, reversing the stance adopted by his predecessor, Joe Biden. He also batted away President Zelenskyy's demand that Ukraine's borders be restored to pre-conflict lines, saying he would freeze the borders at the point of any ceasefire, meaning Moscow would keep hold of the 20% of Ukrainian territory it had taken since 2022. Read more:'Coalition of the willing' to back UkraineHard power is the real currency againStarmer's place as Trump's new BFF tested Last week, Mr Trump appeared less clear on this, telling reporters in the Oval Office for Sir Keir's visit that he would get back Ukrainian land. In short, even if the Europeans can patch up relations between President Zelenskyy and President Trump, there is an even more complex negotiation to then have with President Putin. So, there is still quite some distance to travel, but the prime minister closes this week of intense, and fraught diplomacy, with a sense that the UK and other key partners are back on track and, as President Zelenskyy returned to the frontline in Ukraine on Sunday evening, European leaders know they have to deploy all the hard and soft power they have to try to end this war."

The militant group will only release the remaining Israeli hostages under the terms of the already agreed-upon phased deal, Mahmoud Mardawi told Al Jazeera on Sunday. Under a plan put forward by US Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff, which Israel has accepted, the first phase of the ceasefire deal would continue through Ramadan and Passover, or until 20 April. Ukraine talks latest - Zelenskyy to resign?  Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office said earlier Israel would stop all goods and supplies into Gaza after claiming Hamas was refusing to \"accept the Witkoff outline for continuing the talks, which Israel agreed to\". Hamas condemned the decision to block aid to the enclave, calling it \"a war crime and a blatant attack\" on a truce that took a year of negotiations before taking hold in January. The foreign minister of Egypt, a key mediator in the conflict, said Israel's actions were an attempt to use \"starvation as a weapon\" and \"a flagrant and clear violation of humanitarian law\". \n                  Trump shares AI video of Gaza vision featuring golden statues, bearded belly dancers and Netanyahu on a sunbed\n                 \n                  Operation Iron Wall: West Bank areas 'turning into mini-Gaza' as Israeli troops bulldoze homes\n                 \n                  Netanyahu signals moving ahead with Trump's Gaza plan as Israel receives unblocked US shipment of heavy bombs\n                 Saudi Arabia called Israel's decision \"a tool of extortion\". The first phase of the ceasefire, which expired on Saturday, saw a surge in humanitarian aid after months of growing hunger. Negotiations on the second phase were meant to start a month ago but haven't begun. Israel warned of \"additional consequences\" if Hamas refused to agree to its proposal.  Under the US proposal, Hamas would release half the hostages on the first day and the rest when an agreement is reached on a permanent ceasefire, Mr Netanyahu said. Hamas currently holds 59 hostages, 35 of them believed to be dead, after taking an estimated 250 people captive back to Gaza after its 7 October 2023 raid on southern Israel in which 1,200 people were killed. Israel's military counter-offensive has killed over 48,000 Palestinians, according to Palestinian health officials, displaced an estimated 90% of Gaza's population and destroyed the territory's infrastructure and health system. Washington made no immediate comment but Mr Netanyahu said Israel is fully coordinated with the Trump administration and the ceasefire will only continue as long as Hamas keeps releasing hostages. The International Committee of the Red Cross warned that \"any unraveling of the forward momentum created over the last six weeks risks plunging people back into despair\". The ceasefire has saved countless lives, the humanitarian organisation said.

        "Content": "\n          Security and Defence Editor\n              @haynesdeborah\n Remarkable â and relatively speaking a blessing â that the wake-up call for Britain to take defence seriously again did not come in the form of a military attack on UK soil, but instead was triggered by the verbal assault of Ukraine's wartime leader by a sitting US president. The lack of any physical destruction on British streets, though, should fool no one in government or wider society that the framework of security that has protected the country and its allies since the end of the Second World War is not at best cracked and at worst shattered. Instead, check out one of the latest posts by Elon Musk, Donald Trump's \"disrupter-in-chief\". He used his social media site X to say \"I agree\" with a call for the United States to leave NATO - a transatlantic alliance, and the bedrock of European security, that the new administration had until now continued to back at least in public. It is yet another example of escalating hostility from the new Trump White House - which has sided with Russia against Ukraine, lashed out at its European partners over their values, and even suggested absorbing Canada as the 51st American state. The alarming mood-change by a nation that is meant to be a friend surely demands an equally dramatic shift in approach by NATO's 30 European allies and their Canadian partner. Rather than stating the obvious - that American support can no longer be taken for granted - they should instead be actively adapting to a world in which it fundamentally no longer exists.  Make no mistake, this would be a daunting and humbling prospect - perhaps too awful even to contemplate, in particular for the UK, which has tied itself militarily so closely to the US for pretty much everything from intelligence sharing and technology to nuclear weapons. Britain is not alone. All European militaries, as well as Canada, to a greater or lesser extent rely heavily on their more powerful American partners. Breaking that dependency would require a rapid expansion in military capabilities and capacity across the continent, as well as a huge effort to build up the defence industrial base required to produce weapons at scale and exploit emerging technologies. Sir Keir Starmer - who is hosting a Ukraine summit of allies on Sunday - has rightly adopted the UK's natural position of leadership in Europe in the wake of Donald Trump's extraordinary hostility towards Volodymyr Zelenskyy. He gave the embattled Ukrainian president a warm embrace on Saturday when the two met at Downing Street. Britain is one of Europe's two nuclear-armed states, a powerful voice within NATO, and a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council.  But talking tough on defence and the need to support Ukraine as the US steps back is no longer enough in a world where hard power is the only real currency once again. A pledge by the prime minister to increase defence spending to 2.5% of national income by 2027 and to 3% in the next parliament is of course a step in the right direction. Yet unless it is accompanied by much greater speed and urgency coupled with a genuinely generational shift in the entire country's approach to national security then it will go down in history as the headline-grabbing but otherwise empty gesture of a government that has forgotten what it means to be ready to fight wars. Anneliese Dodds, who quit as international development secretary on Thursday over the prime minister's plan to fund his increase in defence spending with a raid on the overseas aid budget, summed up the challenge well in her resignation letter. She wrote that she supported the plan to lift the defence budget but said even 3% \"may only be the start, and it will be impossible to raise the substantial resources needed just through tactical cuts to public spending\". She added: \"These are unprecedented times, when strategic decisions for the sake of our country's security cannot be ducked.\" Read more:Starmer asks leaders to unite ahead of Ukraine summitIsrael agrees to Gaza ceasefire extension  Ms Dodds is right. It is no longer good enough to treat defence, deterrence and wider national resilience as a niche subject that is delivered by an increasingly small, professional military. Rather, it should once again be at the heart of the thinking of all government departments - from the Treasury and business to health and education - led by the prime minister, his national security adviser and the cabinet secretary. This is not something new. It was normal during the Cold War years when, after two world wars, the whole country was acutely aware of the need to maintain costly but credible armed forces and a population that was ready to play its part in a crisis."

Emily Damari was at home on Kibbutz Kfar Aza on 7 October 2023 when Hamas launched its massacre in Israel, killing 62 residents in the community and kidnapping 19 others. The 28-year-old was shot in her left hand and right leg at close range, causing her to lose two fingers and leaving her with injuries to her leg that impair her movement.

She added: \"My recovery will take time and my hand will never fully recover, but the intense pain I had for a year and a half due to the nerves being sewn together after my first operation in Shifa Hospital in Gaza is now no longer with me and the large scar, that was caused by an open, festering wound that did not heal for four months because of the conditions of the tunnels I was held in, is now looking better. \"After my recuperation, with the help of physiotherapy, I hope to be able to use my hand much more effectively than was previously possible, before the surgery.\" Ms Damari's mother, Mandy Damari, said her daughter had been \"sewn up like a pin cushion\" by Hamas, leaving her with significant pain in her hand and leg. She said Hamas did not provide any medical aid except for an out-of-date bottle of iodine during her daughter's time in captivity. \"It is nothing short of a miracle that she did not contract a life-threatening infection,\" she added. Ms Damari said she was kept in Hamas's network of underground tunnels with no sanitation or access to clean water. \"It was shocking but not surprising to see how emaciated some of the other hostages were when they came out. Hamas has created hell on Earth, the conditions down there are unimaginable,\" she added. Prime Minister Keir Starmer has invited Ms Damari and her mother to visit No 10 on their next visit to the UK and fans of her favourite football club Tottenham Hotspur have offered her matchday tickets.

In the message, the pope said he was living his time in hospital as an experience of solidarity with people who are sick and suffering everywhere, and thanked his doctors for their care and well-wishers for their prayers. \"I feel in my heart the 'blessing' that is hidden within frailty, because it is precisely in these moments that we learn even more to trust in the Lord,\" Francis said. \"At the same time, I thank God for giving me the opportunity to share in body and spirit the condition of so many sick and suffering people. \"I would like to thank you for the prayers, which rise up to the Lord from the hearts of so many faithful from many parts of the world: I feel all your affection and closeness and, at this particular time, I feel as if I am 'carried' and supported by all God's people.\" It was the third weekend in a row the pope cancelled his Sunday appointment to deliver the Angelus prayer in person.

Earlier in the day, Vatican sources stressed the pope was not out of danger and said his clinical conditions were just as complete as at the beginning of his health crisis two weeks ago. Asked if, during Friday's crisis, the pope underwent an invasive treatment, the Vatican source replied: \"It is possible.\" The pope, who had part of a lung removed when he was young, was admitted to Rome's Gemelli hospital on 14 February after his bronchitis worsened and turned into pneumonia in both lungs. Vatican officials have made alternative plans for Ash Wednesday next week, making clear Francis still has a long road ahead."

        "Content": "Firefly Aerospace's Blue Ghost lander has successfully touched down on the moon, in a pivotal moment for private space travel. The size of a compact car, the four-legged lander is carrying 10 scientific payloads and used 21 thrusters to guide itself to touchdown near an ancient volcanic vent on Mare Crisium, a large basin in the northeast corner of the moon's Earth-facing side. It has on board a vacuum to suck up moon dirt for analysis and a drill to measure temperatures as deep as 10 feet. Also on board is a device for eliminating abrasive lunar dust - a scourge for NASA's long-ago Apollo moon walkers, who got it caked all over their spacesuits and equipment. The demos should get two weeks of runtime before lunar daytime ends and the lander shuts down. A smooth upright landing makes Firefly - a decade old startup - the first private company to put a spacecraft on the moon without it crashing or falling over. The lander was launched in mid-January. Dr Joel Kearns, deputy associate administrator at NASA, said this area was of \"great scientific interest\" but also \"a very achievable place to land\". This moment, he said, was \"one for the history books\". Firefly becomes the second private firm to score a soft moon landing, after Houston-based Intuitive Machines' Odysseus lander made a lopsided soft touchdown last year. A \"soft\" moon landing refers to a controlled landing on the moon, where it touches down at a low speed and causes minimal damage to the vehicle. A \"hard landing\" would be a crash landing. Only five nations have been successful in soft-landings in the past: The then-Soviet Union, the US, China, India and Japan. Dr Nicola Fox, from NASA's Science Mission Directorate, said: \"We choose our landing sites very carefully. \"We want to study the geological features on the moon. We want to study the interaction with the solar wind.\" She said part of this mission will help lay the groundwork for future space missions and \"prepare for future astronauts\" to return to the moon. 'A sustainable commercial lunar economy' Backed by NASA and its flagship Artemis moon program, private companies have played a significant role in the modern moon race. The moonshot by Firefly, an upstart primarily building rockets, is one of three lunar missions actively in progress. The space agency paid $101m (Â£80.3m) for the delivery, plus $44m (Â£35m) for the science and tech on board. Dr Fox said one of the hopes from this was to generate \"a sustainable commercial lunar economy and have it led by American companies\". Two other companies' landers are hot on Blue Ghost's heels, with the next one expected to join it on the moon later this week. Read more:Probe blasts off on SpaceX rocket to survey asteroidInvestigation opened into SpaceX's explosive test flight Elon Musk's Space X and Jeff Bezos' Blue Origin are building landers to put US astronauts on the moon as soon as 2027 - this would be for the first time since 1972.  The moon is littered with wreckage, not only from space, but dozens of other failed attempts over the decades. NASA wants to keep up a pace of two private lunar landers a year, realising some missions will fail, said Dr Fox. Unlike NASA's successful Apollo moon landings, which had billions of dollars behind them, private companies operate on a limited budget with robotic craft that must land on their own, said Firefly CEO Jason Kim."

The Republican said \"it's up to the Ukrainians to figure that out\". Meanwhile Lord Mandelson, the UK's ambassador to the US, told ABC News: \"I think that Ukraine should be the first to commit to a ceasefire and defy the Russians to follow. \"And then, as part of the unfolding plan for this negotiation, the Europeans and perhaps some other countries too have got to consider how they are going to put forces on the ground to play their part in providing enduring security and deterrence for Ukraine.\" Ukraine war summit latest: 'This is a once in a generation moment', PM tells EU leaders  The remarks came two days after a disastrous meeting between the Ukrainian president and Donald Trump and his vice president JD Vance descended into a shouting match in the Oval Office. Mr Johnson said: \"What President Zelenskyy did in the White House was effectively signal to us that he's not ready for that yet and I think that's a great disappointment.\" The fallout left a proposed agreement between Ukraine and the US to jointly develop Ukraine's natural resources in limbo. The idea of Mr Zelenskyy stepping aside also came up on Friday after the Oval Office meeting, with US Republican senator Lindsey Graham saying the Ukrainian leader \"either needs to resign or send somebody over that we can do business with, or he needs to change\". Meanwhile, White House national security adviser Mike Waltz said it is not clear Mr Zelenskyy is prepared to secure lasting peace with Russia. \"We need a leader that can deal with us, eventually deal with the Russians and end this war,\" Mr Waltz told CNN when asked whether Mr Trump wants Mr Zelenskyy to resign.  \"If it becomes apparent that President Zelenskyy's either personal motivations or political motivations are divergent from ending the fighting in his country, then I think we have a real issue on our hands.\" US secretary of state Marco Rubio said he had not spoken to Mr Zelenskyy since the spat on Friday. \"We'll be ready to re-engage when they're ready to make peace,\" Mr Rubio told ABC. But Democratic senator Amy Klobuchar told ABC she was \"appalled\" by the clash in the Oval Office and said she met Mr Zelenskyy before he went to the White House on Friday and he had been excited to sign an expected minerals deal. \"There is still an opening here\" for a peace deal, she said.

Sky News has learnt that Inflexion, the buyout firm, has hired investment bankers to orchestrate a sale of ANS, which provides cloud hosting services to corporate customers. UKFast was rebranded as ANS in the wake of revelations in the Financial Times in 2019 about the conduct of UKFast's founder, Lawrence Jones. Mr Jones was convicted of rape and sexual assault in 2023, and was sentenced to 15 years in prison. In December, he was stripped of his MBE, which had been awarded for services to the digital economy in 2015. Arma Partners is understood to have been hired to advise on the sale of ANS, which was acquired by Inflexion in 2021.

His comments at Stansted Airport come after Republicans including senator Lindsay Graham and speaker Mike Johnson suggested he should step down from his position following the fiery White House exchange with President Trump. Mr Zelenskyy spoke to journalists shortly before leaving the UK on Sunday evening. In response to a question from Yalda Hakim, Mr Zelenskyy said: \"I can give [Lindsay Graham] citizenship of Ukraine and he will become a citizen of our country. \"And then his voice will start to gain weight, and I will hear him as a citizen of Ukraine on the topic of who must be the president.\" \"The president of Ukraine will have to be chosen not in Lindsay Graham's home but in Ukraine,\" he added. Mr Zelenskyy confirmed there has been communication between Ukraine and the Trump administration since the clash on Friday, but \"not on my level\". Mr Graham - a Republican senator and close Trump ally - labelled the meeting a \"complete, utter disaster\" at a press briefing on Friday.  Asked whether Mr Zelenskyy should step aside, he said: \"He either needs to resign or send somebody over that we can do business with, or he needs to change.\" After the London summit on Sunday, the prime minister unveiled a four-step plan discussed by leaders, including a pledge to \"develop a coalition of the willing\" to defend a deal in Ukraine and guarantee a peace settlement. Sir Keir said Europe \"must do the heavy lifting\", and the UK \"is prepared to back this with boots on the ground and planes in the air, together with others\". He also announced a new deal which will allow Ukraine to use Â£1.6bn of UK export finance to buy 5,000 more air defence missiles. Zelenskyy's meeting with the King The Ukrainian president's 90-minute sit down with the media came shortly after he wrapped up a tough week with a visit to see the King at Sandringham. Mr Zelenskyy flew to Norfolk in a helicopter on Sunday afternoon after attending the security summit in central London. People - some holding Ukraine flags - gathered outside Sandringham to try to witness his arrival. A military helicopter could be seen flying low before descending over the estate. Pictures released after the meeting show Charles and Mr Zelenskyy shaking hands by the entrance to the royal home. The pair chatted briefly before heading inside, where they posed for more photographs. Their meeting lasted just under an hour, Sky News understands. A difficult week for Ukrainian president Mr Zelenskyy's difficult few days began on Friday, when his day at the White House with Mr Trump was cut short after their meeting in the Oval Office descended into a shouting match. The pair had been due to sign a minerals deal and hold a joint press conference - but both events were called off after their tense exchange, fuelled in part by comments from vice president JD Vance.

        "Content": "\n          Political editor\n              @BethRigby\n  There was both symbolism and substance on Sunday as European leaders and NATO allies gathered in London to try to pick up the pieces after a shattering encounter in the Oval Office between the president of a superpower and a president at war. The symbolism was of European leaders and NATO allies gathering to stand shoulder to shoulder in a show of solidarity with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, after his mauling in the White House by US President Donald Trump and his vice president JD Vance. There was also real substance on Sunday as European and NATO allies committed to spending more on defence and stepping up to defend their borders against Russian aggression, with an eye on a US partner which, whatever Sir Keir Starmer might say, Europeans are not sure they can now rely on.  Ukraine talks latest - Zelenskyy to resign? EU Commission president Ursula von der Leyen, emerging from over two hours of talks, spoke of the EU plan - to be presented on Thursday - to increase defence spending. \"Member states need more fiscal space to do a surge in defence spending,\" she told reporters, adding Europe needed to turn Ukraine \"into a steel porcupine that is indigestible for potential invaders\". NATO secretary general Mark Rutte said he had heard new announcements from European leaders to ramp up defence spending. \n                  Hard power is the world's real currency once again - talking tough on defence won't be enough\n                 \n                  Trump and Zelenskyy's body language during White House row analysed\n                 \n                  Trump 100 Day 41: Is there any coming back from Trump Vs Zelenskyy?\n                 After decades of outsourcing its defence to the US and cashing in the post-Cold War peace dividend on health, education and welfare spending, Europe is all too aware that it has entered different times. Sir Keir has inserted himself into the heart of this endeavour as one of the few leaders - alongside perhaps President Emmanuel Macron of France and Georgia Meloni of Italy - capable of acting as the bridge between the Trump White House and the EU.  A Whitehall source said the prime minister \"feels the urgency and knows the unique role he can play\", adding that Sir Keir is \"very focused\". After the blow-up in the White House on Friday which saw the groundwork carefully laid by Sir Keir and Mr Macron to try to secure US security guarantees for Ukraine ripped up, the PM has spent the weekend trying to get it back on track with both Mr Zelenskyy and Mr Trump. I'm told it involves getting President Zelenskyy back to the table to do the deal, and then persuading European leaders to go beyond Twitter rhetoric and step up on defence spending, preparing now for a world with no US security guarantee for Europe, not just in Ukraine. Sir Keir told me clearly he does not view the US as an unreliable ally, and that the plan he, Mr Macron and others put together will be presented to Mr Trump and \"taken forward together\". But it is undeniable that Europe will have to step up. The PM spoke on Sunday of a \"coalition of the willing\", made up of nations prepared to defend a deal in Ukraine and to guarantee peace. \"Those willing will intensify planning now with real urgency,\" he said, confirming that the UK is \"prepared to back this with boots on the ground and planes in the air, together with others\". The hope is that the commitment from European allies will be enough for the US to provide the last resort backstop if Russian President Vladimir Putin decides to break the terms of any deal. It would involve intelligence and air cover but not boots on the ground. There is tentative optimism once more in Number 10, knocked sideways by its own diplomatic triumph on Thursday being followed by Mr Zelenskyy's Washington setback.  \"There is still a way to go, but we feel like we're making progress,\" one government source said, while another told me the PM was \"pleased at the quality of the discussion at the summit and feels like things are moving forward\". When I asked another if they were confident they could bind President Trump back in, they said they were \"hopeful, not confident\". Of course, getting talks back on track is only the first hurdle of many. Even if Sir Keir and Mr Macron can patch things up with Mr Trump and Mr Zelenskyy, what might this peace deal look like, and crucially will Russia, perhaps emboldened by the fracturing of the Western alliance, be less minded to deal or make undeliverable demands? The PM said on Sunday that it was up to Europeans to set the parameters of a peace deal rather than allow Russia to \"dictate the terms of any security guarantees before we've even got to a deal\". ð Follow Trump 100 on your podcast app ð Mr Trump has offered Mr Putin one concession by ruling out Ukraine joining NATO, reversing the stance adopted by his predecessor, Joe Biden. He also batted away President Zelenskyy's demand that Ukraine's borders be restored to pre-conflict lines, saying he would freeze the borders at the point of any ceasefire, meaning Moscow would keep hold of the 20% of Ukrainian territory it had taken since 2022. Read more:'Coalition of the willing' to back UkraineHard power is the real currency againStarmer's place as Trump's new BFF tested Last week, Mr Trump appeared less clear on this, telling reporters in the Oval Office for Sir Keir's visit that he would get back Ukrainian land. In short, even if the Europeans can patch up relations between President Zelenskyy and President Trump, there is an even more complex negotiation to then have with President Putin. So, there is still quite some distance to travel, but the prime minister closes this week of intense, and fraught diplomacy, with a sense that the UK and other key partners are back on track and, as President Zelenskyy returned to the frontline in Ukraine on Sunday evening, European leaders know they have to deploy all the hard and soft power they have to try to end this war."

Europe must do the heavy lifting.\" The summit of EU leaders, along with Canada and Turkey, had been planned for over a week but took on an added urgency following the disastrous meeting between President Trump and Volodymyr Zelenskyy at the White House on Friday. \n                  'We can still trust the Americans', minister says despite breakdown between Trump and Zelenskyy\n                 \n                  Will ministerial resignation dent Starmer's post-Trump high?\n                 \n                  Day 40: Charmer Starmer plays his Trump card \n                 In front of the world's cameras, Mr Trump accused the Ukrainian president - who is met with the King at Sandringham - of \"disrespecting\" the United States and \"gambling with World War Three\" when he expressed scepticism that Vladimir Putin cold be trusted to honour ceasefire agreements. The diplomatic breakdown intensified fears among some Western leaders that the United States could not be relied upon to support Ukraine militarily, with Kaja Kallas, the EU high representative for foreign affairs and security policy, posting on social media: \"Today, it became clear that the free world needs a new leader. It's up to us, Europeans, to take this challenge.\" Sir Keir has been positioning himself as a peace broker between the US and Europe following Mr Trump's ascension to the White House, but his task was made more pressing following the clash in the Oval Office - which he earlier admitted he found \"uncomfortable\". 'Our countries are intertwined' However, answering a question from Sky News' political editor Beth Rigby, the prime minister rejected the claim that the US was no longer a reliable partner. \"I do not accept that the US is an unreliable ally,\" he said. \"The US has been a reliable ally to the UK for many, many decades and continues to be. There are no two countries as closely aligned as our two countries. Our defence, our security and intelligence is intertwined.\" Security and Defence Editor The use of the term \"coalition of the willing\" to describe the nations that agree to support an international force to help protect any ceasefire deal in Ukraine is interesting and notable.\n\n It could perhaps be an attempt by Sir Keir Starmer to appeal to an American audience as this was the phrase the United States used for its \"coalition of the willing\" to invade Iraq more than two decades ago.\n\n That intervention ended in disaster, triggering a bloody insurgency and locking the US and its allies into a costly war, despite the successful toppling of Saddam Hussein.\n\n But reviving the words \"coalition of the willing\" will - if nothing else - remind Washington that London was its biggest and strongest backer when it turned to allies to back its 2003 invasion.\n\n He confirmed the UK, France and Ukraine would work on a peace plan that will be presented to the US and that the White House would continue to be part of the process. \"The discussions we've had today, particularly the coalition of the willing, is on the basis that this is a plan that we will work with the US and that it will have U.S. backing,\" he said. \"That is the purpose of the plan and that is why I spoke to President Trump last night before we developed the work on this plan.\" Asked whether he had been trying to persuade other nations to join the so-called \"coalition of the willing\" today, Sir Keir said \"a number of countries\" had indicated that they wanted to be \"part of the plan that we are developing\". \"I'll leave them to make their own statements about exactly how they want to make that contribution,\" he said. \"But we've been able to move that forward. I accept, without criticism and with respect, the position of other countries that may not feel that they want to contribute in that way - but I strongly feel that unless some move forward, we will stay in the position we're in and not be able to move forward.\" Extra Â£1.6bn for Ukraine Elsewhere in the news conference, Sir Keir announced a new deal which will allow Ukraine to use Â£1.6bn of UK export finance to buy 5,000 more air defence missiles. The prime minister said the move will create jobs in the UK's defence sector and would also be \"vital for protecting critical infrastructure and strengthen Ukraine\". It comes on top of the UK announcing that it would increase defence spending to 2.5% of GDP by 2027, from the current 2.3%. Chancellor Rachel Reeves also announced that the UK would give Ukraine an extra Â£2.26bn for its war effort, funded by the profits made from hundreds of billions of dollars' worth of Russian sovereign assets that Western nations have frozen since the start of the full-scale war in February 2022.

She said she will present a plan to \"rearm\" Europe in the coming days. Speaking to broadcasters outside Lancaster House following the conclusion of Sunday's summit, Ms Von der Leyen said \"comprehensive security guarantees\" from Europe as well as the United States were needed. She said \"we have to put Ukraine in a position of strength\" so that \"it has the means to fortify and protect itself\" in economic and military terms. \"Therefore the focus is not only on the military supply but also. for example, securing their energy system,\" she added."

        "Content": "\n          Security and Defence Editor\n              @haynesdeborah\n Remarkable â and relatively speaking a blessing â that the wake-up call for Britain to take defence seriously again did not come in the form of a military attack on UK soil, but instead was triggered by the verbal assault of Ukraine's wartime leader by a sitting US president. The lack of any physical destruction on British streets, though, should fool no one in government or wider society that the framework of security that has protected the country and its allies since the end of the Second World War is not at best cracked and at worst shattered. Instead, check out one of the latest posts by Elon Musk, Donald Trump's \"disrupter-in-chief\". He used his social media site X to say \"I agree\" with a call for the United States to leave NATO - a transatlantic alliance, and the bedrock of European security, that the new administration had until now continued to back at least in public. It is yet another example of escalating hostility from the new Trump White House - which has sided with Russia against Ukraine, lashed out at its European partners over their values, and even suggested absorbing Canada as the 51st American state. The alarming mood-change by a nation that is meant to be a friend surely demands an equally dramatic shift in approach by NATO's 30 European allies and their Canadian partner. Rather than stating the obvious - that American support can no longer be taken for granted - they should instead be actively adapting to a world in which it fundamentally no longer exists.  Make no mistake, this would be a daunting and humbling prospect - perhaps too awful even to contemplate, in particular for the UK, which has tied itself militarily so closely to the US for pretty much everything from intelligence sharing and technology to nuclear weapons. Britain is not alone. All European militaries, as well as Canada, to a greater or lesser extent rely heavily on their more powerful American partners. Breaking that dependency would require a rapid expansion in military capabilities and capacity across the continent, as well as a huge effort to build up the defence industrial base required to produce weapons at scale and exploit emerging technologies. Sir Keir Starmer - who is hosting a Ukraine summit of allies on Sunday - has rightly adopted the UK's natural position of leadership in Europe in the wake of Donald Trump's extraordinary hostility towards Volodymyr Zelenskyy. He gave the embattled Ukrainian president a warm embrace on Saturday when the two met at Downing Street. Britain is one of Europe's two nuclear-armed states, a powerful voice within NATO, and a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council.  But talking tough on defence and the need to support Ukraine as the US steps back is no longer enough in a world where hard power is the only real currency once again. A pledge by the prime minister to increase defence spending to 2.5% of national income by 2027 and to 3% in the next parliament is of course a step in the right direction. Yet unless it is accompanied by much greater speed and urgency coupled with a genuinely generational shift in the entire country's approach to national security then it will go down in history as the headline-grabbing but otherwise empty gesture of a government that has forgotten what it means to be ready to fight wars. Anneliese Dodds, who quit as international development secretary on Thursday over the prime minister's plan to fund his increase in defence spending with a raid on the overseas aid budget, summed up the challenge well in her resignation letter. She wrote that she supported the plan to lift the defence budget but said even 3% \"may only be the start, and it will be impossible to raise the substantial resources needed just through tactical cuts to public spending\". She added: \"These are unprecedented times, when strategic decisions for the sake of our country's security cannot be ducked.\" Read more:Starmer asks leaders to unite ahead of Ukraine summitIsrael agrees to Gaza ceasefire extension  Ms Dodds is right. It is no longer good enough to treat defence, deterrence and wider national resilience as a niche subject that is delivered by an increasingly small, professional military. Rather, it should once again be at the heart of the thinking of all government departments - from the Treasury and business to health and education - led by the prime minister, his national security adviser and the cabinet secretary. This is not something new. It was normal during the Cold War years when, after two world wars, the whole country was acutely aware of the need to maintain costly but credible armed forces and a population that was ready to play its part in a crisis."

        "Content": "\n          Political reporter\n              @alexrogerssky\n The UK can still trust the US with Ukraine's future despite the bad-tempered clash at the White House between Donald Trump and Volodymyr Zelenskyy, a minister has said. Cabinet Office minister Nick Thomas-Symonds told Sky's Sunday Morning with Trevor Phillips there was \"no ambiguity\" over whether the US continued to be an important ally for Britain despite the unpleasant scenes that unfolded in the Oval Office on Friday. There are concerns among Western leaders that the exchange - which resulted in Mr Zelenskyy leaving empty-handed and without having signed an important minerals deal to continue US support - could result in the White House withdrawing aid for Ukraine's war effort. Politics latest: Starmer hosts Ukraine war and security summit But Mr Thomas-Symonds, who is also minister for the constitution and European Union relations, said he believed we could \"still trust the Americans\". And he said that in the event the US did pull financial support for Ukraine, the UK would \"continue to be an honest broker\" and \"bring the different parties together\". Echoing the US's president's language, he added: \"We will also continue to make the case that peace is made from a position of strength, not a position of weakness. \n                  UK to defend Ukraine peace deal with 'coalition of willing', Starmer says\n                 \n                  Will ministerial resignation dent Starmer's post-Trump high?\n                 \n                  Day 40: Charmer Starmer plays his Trump card \n                 \"So, it remains critical to put Ukraine in the strongest possible position.\" On whether Britain could still trust the Americans, Mr Thomas-Symonds replied: \"Yes, I do believe we can trust the Americans. \"We do have an ally in the United States that we can trust,\" he continued. \"There's no ambiguity about that.\" Sir Keir Starmer's desire to act as bridge between the US and Europe will be tested as he hosts a number of EU leaders for a summit in London. Present will be the leaders of Italy, France, Germany, the Netherlands, Poland, Spain, Finland, Denmark, Norway, the Czech Republic and Romania. Canada and Turkey will also attend. The PM's role as a peacemaker takes on greater significance following the breakdown in relations between Mr Trump and Mr Zelenskyy that unfolded in front of the world's TV cameras. In the aftermath of the fallout, Sir Keir phoned Mr Zelenskyy and invited him to Downing Street on Saturday ahead of today's summit in a show of support for Ukraine.  He also phoned the US president, saying his \"driving purpose\" was to \"bridge this and get us back to the central focus\". Turning to the scenes at the Oval Office on Friday, Mr Thomas-Symonds admitted he had \"never seen anything quite like that\". \"Obviously that is not how it should have happened.\" His sentiments were echoed by shadow foreign secretary Priti Patel, who said she was \"absolutely aghast\" at \"the whole spectacle\" which saw Mr Trump accuse the Ukrainian president of \"disrespecting\" the United States and \"gambling with World War Three\". Read more:Hard power is the world's real currency once againStarmer's position as Trump's new best friend will be tested  In a sign of how badly the meeting went, the minerals deal the pair had expected to sign - which would have established a new fund for the US to invest in Ukraine's minerals, rare earth materials and other valuable natural resources - was put on ice. Mr Trump viewed the minerals transaction as a fair way to recover the billions of dollars that the US has given Kyiv in its war effort and as necessary to guarantee further US military support for Ukraine. Ms Patel said the scenes at the White House were \"unedifying and undignified\". \"When we look at President Zelenskyy...I think he's a hero,\" she went on. \"He's an absolute hero in the way in which he stood up to authoritarianism. He's fighting for the sovereignty of his country. \"He also know when the going gets tough. You keep your disagreements not in front of cameras, but you keep them private. So, you know, we are where we are.\""

        "Content": "TikTok, Reddit and Imgur are to be investigated by the UK's data protection watchdog over how they use teenage users' personal information.  The Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) said it wants to look into how video-sharing app TikTok uses information from users aged 13 to 17 to deliver content recommendations to them. The investigations into online forum site Reddit and image-sharing site Imgur will focus on their use of age assurance measures, such as how they estimate and verify children's ages, and how they use their personal information. The regulator is taking action amid growing concerns about how social media platforms use data generated by children's online activity in their recommendation algorithms - and the potential for young people to be served harmful or inappropriate content as a result. TikTok's algorithm powers the For You Page, which recommends videos to users based on the content they engage with on the app. A study previously found the app was suggesting eating disorder and self-harm content to some new teen accounts within minutes.

More from Sky News:Who could buy TikTok?Children's charity criticises Snapchat He insisted the regular is not \"picking on TikTok\" by including it in the investigation and said the choice was motivated by \"the direction of growth travel in relation to young users, market dominance and potential for harm\". \"We've got to choose one - we can't spread ourselves too thinly,\" he said. \"We hope to learn lessons that the whole industry will be able to adopt.\" The ICO said its investigations will examine whether there have been any data protection infringements, and if evidence of potential breaches is found, it will put the information to the platforms for their input before reaching a conclusion."

        "Content": "Firefly Aerospace's Blue Ghost lander has successfully touched down on the moon, in a pivotal moment for private space travel. The size of a compact car, the four-legged lander is carrying 10 scientific payloads and used 21 thrusters to guide itself to touchdown near an ancient volcanic vent on Mare Crisium, a large basin in the northeast corner of the moon's Earth-facing side. It has on board a vacuum to suck up moon dirt for analysis and a drill to measure temperatures as deep as 10 feet. Also on board is a device for eliminating abrasive lunar dust - a scourge for NASA's long-ago Apollo moon walkers, who got it caked all over their spacesuits and equipment. The demos should get two weeks of runtime before lunar daytime ends and the lander shuts down. A smooth upright landing makes Firefly - a decade old startup - the first private company to put a spacecraft on the moon without it crashing or falling over. The lander was launched in mid-January. Dr Joel Kearns, deputy associate administrator at NASA, said this area was of \"great scientific interest\" but also \"a very achievable place to land\". This moment, he said, was \"one for the history books\". Firefly becomes the second private firm to score a soft moon landing, after Houston-based Intuitive Machines' Odysseus lander made a lopsided soft touchdown last year. A \"soft\" moon landing refers to a controlled landing on the moon, where it touches down at a low speed and causes minimal damage to the vehicle. A \"hard landing\" would be a crash landing. Only five nations have been successful in soft-landings in the past: The then-Soviet Union, the US, China, India and Japan. Dr Nicola Fox, from NASA's Science Mission Directorate, said: \"We choose our landing sites very carefully. \"We want to study the geological features on the moon. We want to study the interaction with the solar wind.\" She said part of this mission will help lay the groundwork for future space missions and \"prepare for future astronauts\" to return to the moon. 'A sustainable commercial lunar economy' Backed by NASA and its flagship Artemis moon program, private companies have played a significant role in the modern moon race. The moonshot by Firefly, an upstart primarily building rockets, is one of three lunar missions actively in progress. The space agency paid $101m (Â£80.3m) for the delivery, plus $44m (Â£35m) for the science and tech on board. Dr Fox said one of the hopes from this was to generate \"a sustainable commercial lunar economy and have it led by American companies\". Two other companies' landers are hot on Blue Ghost's heels, with the next one expected to join it on the moon later this week. Read more:Probe blasts off on SpaceX rocket to survey asteroidInvestigation opened into SpaceX's explosive test flight Elon Musk's Space X and Jeff Bezos' Blue Origin are building landers to put US astronauts on the moon as soon as 2027 - this would be for the first time since 1972.  The moon is littered with wreckage, not only from space, but dozens of other failed attempts over the decades. NASA wants to keep up a pace of two private lunar landers a year, realising some missions will fail, said Dr Fox. Unlike NASA's successful Apollo moon landings, which had billions of dollars behind them, private companies operate on a limited budget with robotic craft that must land on their own, said Firefly CEO Jason Kim."

        "Content": "The family of pop star Liam Payne has criticised the media for causing \"indescribable, lasting damage\" in the wake of his death. The singer, 31, died in October last year, after falling from a hotel balcony in Argentina. He was honoured with a video montage, played at Saturday night's BRIT awards, celebrating his legacy - with clips including his time on X-Factor and during his time with One Direction. The band won seven BRIT awards before they split in 2016. In a statement, released to the media after the tribute was played, his family called the death an \"unspeakable tragedy\". The family also criticised the \"attention and speculation\" in the press that caused \"indescribable, lasting damage on the family, particularly on Liam's son, who is trying to process emotions which no seven-year-old should have to experience\". It said the family accepted the Court of Appeal's decision to drop all charges in relation to Payne's death. Charges were dropped against three defendants: Payne's friend Roger Nores, who had accompanied him during his trip to Buenos Aires; Gilda Martin, the manager of the Casa Sur Palermo Hotel where Payne died; and Esteban Grassi, the hotel's main receptionist. Two others are still facing prosecution for allegedly supplying Payne with drugs. Supplying drugs in Argentina carries a sentence of up to 15 years in prison. Toxicology tests revealed that before his death, he had traces of alcohol, cocaine, and a prescription antidepressant in his body. A postmortem ruled his cause of death as \"polytrauma\" from multiple injuries and internal and external bleeding. Liamâs death was an unspeakable tragedy. This is a time of tremendous grief and pain for those who knew and loved him. âLiam ought to have had a long life ahead of him. Instead, Bear has lost his father, Geoff and Karen have lost their son, Ruth and Nicola have lost their brother and all of Liamâs friends and fans have lost someone they held very dear. We understand that the investigation into Liamâs death was absolutely necessary and the family recognises the work done by the Argentinian authorities. However, the family accepts the Court of Appealâs decision to drop all charges. The constant media attention and speculation which has accompanied the process has exacted indescribable, lasting damage on the family, particularly on Liamâs son, who is trying to process emotions which no seven-year-old should have to experience. The family has always wished for privacy to grieve and asks that they be given the space and time to do so. This weekend, at the Brit Awards, Liam was remembered for his phenomenal contribution to British music and for his wider, positive impact on millions of adoring fans the world over. We joined in that celebration of his life and will forever remember the joy that his music brought to the world. Liam, you are so loved and missed. 'Beautiful' Brits tribute After the video aired, Payne's former band member Louis Tomlinson thanked the BRIT Awards and said: \"Beautiful tribute. Miss you always, brother x.\" Awards host Jack Whitehall introduced the tribute to the singer and said: \"He achieved so much in the short time that he was on this earth, and was not only a supremely gifted musician but an incredibly kind soul who touched the lives of everyone he came into contact with. \"We have so many amazing memories with Liam here at The BRITs. So, tonight we celebrate his legacy and look back and remember, the remarkable Liam Payne.\""

        "Content": "Boxer Gervonta Davis has held onto his WBA lightweight title despite voluntarily dropping a knee to the canvas and getting hair product wiped from his face. His opponent, Lamont Roach, said the knee position should have counted as a \"knockdown\". Had it been, Davis would have lost a point and Roach would have won their bout in New York, leading to Davis's first career defeat. But the fight was scored as a majority draw, meaning that Davis - nicknamed Tank - held onto his belt. One judge gave the contest to Davis 115-113, the other two scoring it 114-114. Davis willingly took a knee near his corner in the ninth round before leaning over the ropes so his team could towel off the area around an eye. He said grease had got into the eye after having his hair done a few days before the bout. Referee Steve Willis did not count it as a knockdown, as it should be when a knee hits the canvas. Roach commented: \"It should have been a knockdown. If that was knockdown, I win the fight. \"He's saying grease got in his eye, but if he takes a knee and the ref starts counting, it should be a knockdown.\" Read more:Israel stopping all goods and supplies into GazaSecond-ever privately funded space craft touches down on moon Other boxers were surprised, too. Multi-division champion Terence Crawford said: \"I never seen someone take a knee and they don't count it as a knockdown.\" Roach called for a rematch afterwards. \"For sure, Lamont is a great fighter,\" Davis said. \"He got the skills and the punching power. It was a lesson learned. Shout out to Lamont Roach and his whole team. Hopefully we can run it back in New York.\""
