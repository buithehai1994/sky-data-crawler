        "Content": " The home secretary is set to unveil sweeping measures to tackle illegal migration, vowing to end the UK's 'golden ticket' for asylum seekers. People granted asylum in the UK will only be allowed to stay in the country temporarily, in the changes expected to be unveiled on Monday by Shabana Mahmood. Modelled on the Danish system, the aim is to make the UK less attractive for illegal immigrants and make it easier to deport them. Planned changes mean that refugee status will become temporary and subject to regular review, with refugees removed as soon as their home countries are deemed safe. The Home Office said the \"golden ticket\" deal has seen asylum claims surge in the UK, drawing people across Europe, through safe countries, onto dangerous small boats. Under current UK rules, those granted refugee status have it for five years and can then apply for indefinite leave to remain and get on a route to citizenship. As part of the changes, the statutory legal duty to provide asylum seeker support, including housing and weekly allowances, will be revoked. \n                  Refugee status set to become temporary in radical asylum reforms\n                 \n                  Reform's been pretty quiet since Labour started exploring Danish migration model - and this is why\n                 \n                  Denmark bans civilian drones as it ramps up security ahead of EU summit - as Sweden and France contribute equipment\n                 The government will seek to remove asylum support, including accommodation and handouts, to those who have a right to work and who can support themselves but choose not to or those who break UK law. 'Last chance for a decent politics' A government source said Ms Mahmood believes her reforms are about \"more than the electoral fortunes of her party\". \"This is the last chance for a decent, mainstream politics. If these moderate forces fail, she believes, something darker will follow,\" they said. \"But this demands that moderates are willing to do things that will seem immoderate to some. She has reminded those who are reluctant to embrace her ambition for bold reform, with an ultimatum: 'if you don't like this, you won't like what follows me.'\" Ms Mahmood said they were the most sweeping changes to the asylum system \"in a generation\", as she vowed the government will \"restore order and control to our borders\". The home secretary also told The Sunday Times that \"I can see - and I know my colleagues can - that illegal migration is tearing our country apart\".

System being 'gamed' The source said Ms Mahmood believes the system is being \"gamed by those travelling on boats or abusing legal visas\". Some 39,075 people have arrived in the UK after making the journey across the Channel so far this year, according to the latest Home Office figures.  That is an increase of 19% on the same point in 2024 and up 43% on 2023, but remains 5% lower than at the equivalent point in 2022, which remains the peak year for crossings. What happened in Denmark? The UK government points to Denmark remaining a signatory of the European Convention on Human Rights, while also cutting the number of asylum applications to the lowest number in 40 years and successfully removing 95% of rejected asylum seekers. Denmark has adopted increasingly restrictive rules in order to deal with migration over the last few years. In Denmark, most asylum or refugee statuses are temporary. Residency can be revoked once a country is deemed safe. In order to achieve settlement, asylum seekers are required to be in full-time employment, and the length of time it takes to acquire those rights has been extended. Denmark also has tougher rules on family reunification - both the sponsor and their partner are required to be at least 24 years old, which the Danish government says is designed to prevent forced marriages.\n The sponsor must also not have claimed welfare for three years and must provide a financial guarantee for their partner. Both must also pass a Danish language test. In 2018, Denmark introduced what it called a ghetto package, a controversial plan to radically alter some residential areas, including by demolishing social housing. Areas with over 1,000 residents were defined as ghettos if more than 50% were \"immigrants and their descendants from non-Western countries\". In 2021, the left of centre government passed a law that allowed refugees arriving on Danish soil to be moved to asylum centres in a partner country - and subsequently agreed with Rwanda to explore setting up a program, although that has been put on hold. Shadow home secretary Chris Philp said the Labour government has \"lost control\" of the UK's borders\" with illegal channel crossings \"surging to over 62,000 since the election\". He said some of the new measures were welcome but \"they stop well short of what is really required and some are just yet more gimmicks - like the previous 'smash the gangs' gimmick\". Mr Philp added: \"Only the Conservative borders plan will end illegal immigration - by leaving the ECHR, banning asylum claims for illegal immigrants, deporting all illegal arrivals within a week and establishing a Removals Force to deport 150,000 illegal immigrants each year.\" And Enver Solomon, chief executive of Refugee Council, said: \"These sweeping changes will not deter people from making dangerous crossings, but they will unfairly prevent men, women and children from putting down roots and integrating into British life.\" Ms Mahmood will be appearing on Sunday Morning with Trevor Phillips from 8.30am on Sunday."

        "Content": " Video has shown the devastating impact Storm Claudia has had on Portugal, where tornado-like winds battered the country, local media said. Footage from a holiday campsite in Albufeira, where an 85-year-old British woman was killed, shows the extent of the damage caused by the extreme winds, which reached up to 114kmph in Portugal's southern region of the Algarve. Regional commander of the Algarve, Vitor Vaz Pinto, said dozens of people were injured in the area after Storm Claudia hit, two of whom were seriously injured. The injured were of Portuguese, Spanish and British nationalities and ranged in age from six to 85 years old. Follow the latest updates on Storm Claudia According to media reports, the woman was initially reported missing at a campsite and later found dead.

Portuguese media described the extreme weather in the Algarve as a tornado. The storm, which was named by the Spanish meteorological service, affected Portugal and parts of Spain, Britain and Ireland. Sky News' weather presenter Jo Wheeler said the IPMA, or Portuguese Institute for the Sea and Atmosphere, had issued red rain warnings and severe wind warnings \"well ahead of the storm's arrival\". She said there have been more than 2,434 weather-related incidents reported in the Algarve, including a downburst - a strong downward rush of air from a thunderstorm, causing similar damage to a tornado but linear rather than rotational -at Praia da Carvoeiro, with wind gusts of 114 km/hour.

Storm Claudia in the UK In the UK, Storm Claudia caused severe flooding in the town of Monmouth and surrounding areas in southeastern Wales on Saturday. Senedd Member Peter Fox described the impact as being \"devastating\". Rescues, evacuations, and welfare checks were being carried out by the South Wales Fire and Rescue Service, the force said. \"Storm Claudia has caused significant flooding in parts of Wales overnight, which continues to affect homes, businesses, transport and energy infrastructure,\" a spokesperson for the Welsh government said. Natural Resources Wales has issued 11 flood warnings, four of which are severe, as well as 17 flood alerts. In England, according to the Environment Agency's latest update, there were 49 active flood warnings and 134 flood alerts."

        "Content": "\n          Political correspondent\n              @amandaakass\n Many Labour MPs have been left shellshocked after the chaotic political self-sabotage of the past week. Bafflement, anger, disappointment, and sheer frustration are all on relatively open display at the circular firing squad which seems to have surrounded the prime minister. The botched effort to flush out backroom plotters and force Wes Streeting to declare his loyalty ahead of the budget has instead led even previously loyal Starmerites to predict the PM could be forced out of office before the local elections in May. \"We have so many councillors coming up for election across the country,\" one says, \"and at the moment it looks like they're going to be wiped out. That's our base - we just can't afford to lose them. I like Keir [Starmer] but there's only a limited window left to turn things around. There's a real question of urgency.\" Another criticised a \"boys club\" at No 10 who they claimed have \"undermined\" the prime minister and \"forgotten they're meant to be serving the British people.\" There's clearly widespread muttering about what to do next - and even a degree of enviousness at the lack of a regicidal 1922 committee mechanism, as enjoyed by the Tories. \"Leadership speculation is destabilising,\" one said. \"But there's really no obvious strategy. Andy Burnham isn't even an MP. You'd need a stalking horse candidate and we don't have one. There's no 1922. It's very messy.\" \n                  Gordon Brown 'confident' of two-child benefit cap change - as he calls for gambling tax to pay for it\n                 \n                  Starmer says Lammy 'setting out facts to best of his knowledge' on prisoner releases\n                 \n                  Labour's dilemma: The two-child benefit cap\n                 Others are gunning for the chancellor after months of careful pitch-rolling for manifesto-breaching tax rises in the budget were ripped up overnight. \"Her career is toast,\" one told me. \"Rachel has just lost all credibility. She screwed up on the manifesto. She screwed up on the last two fiscal events, costing the party huge amounts of support and leaving the economy stagnating. \"Having now walked everyone up the mountain of tax rises and made us vote to support them on the opposition day debate two days ago, she's now worried her job is at risk and has bottled it. \"Talk to any major business or investor and they are holding off investing in the UK until it is clear what the UK's tax policy is going to be, putting us in a situation where the chancellor is going to have to go through this all over again in six months - which just means no real economic growth for another six months.\" Read more:Starmer and Reeves ditch plans to raise income taxFormer chancellor Osborne is shock contender to head HSBC After less than 18 months in office, the government is stuck in a political morass largely of its own making. Treasury sources have belatedly argued that the chancellor's pre-budget change of heart on income tax is down to better-than-expected economic forecasts from the Office for Budget Responsibility. That should be a cause of celebration. The question is whether she and the PM are now too damaged to make that case to the country - and rescue their benighted prospects."

Eubank Jr won the original fight by unanimous decision in April - but the roles were reversed this time as Benn dominated his opponent from start to finish in the 12 rounds.

He gave up everything to live the dream. \"He's a great example to people who might not see a way back. He's an inspiration. He was done. He had no money.

        "Content": "Donald Trump has confirmed he plans to sue the BBC for between $1bn and $5bn over the editing of his speech in a Panorama news programme. The corporation said it was an \"error of judgement\" to splice two sections of his speech together, and the programme will \"not be broadcast again in this form on any BBC platforms\". \"We have to do it, they've even admitted that they cheated,\" the US president told reporters overnight on Saturday. \"Not that they couldn't have not done that. They cheated. They changed the words coming out of my mouth.\" However, the lawsuit will not be easy, according to three experts who have spoken to Sky News. \"Filing a lawsuit is easy,\" said Mark Stevens, media law solicitor at Howard Kennedy, to Sky presenter Samantha Washington. \"Winning one is, in this case, like trying to lasso a tornado: technically possible, but you're going to need more than a cowboy hat.\" So why would this case be so hard to win? Where did the damage occur? The Panorama episode was not aired in the US, which may make Mr Trump's case harder. \"For a libel claim to succeed, harm must occur where the case is brought,\" said Mr Stevens. \"It's hard to argue [for] that reputational damage in a jurisdiction where the content wasn't aired.\"  The president will also have to show that his reputation suffered actual harm. \"But his reputation was pretty damaged on this issue before,\" said Mr Stevens. \"There have been judicial findings, congressional hearings, global media coverage around 6 January. Laying that responsibility for any further harm at the door of the BBC seems pretty tenuous.\" Was the mistake malicious? In order to sue someone for libel in the US, you have to prove they did it on purpose - or with 'malicious intent'. That might be hard to prove, according to Alan Rusbridger, editor of Prospect magazine and former editor-in-chief of the Guardian.  \"I just don't think that he can do that,\" he said. Since 1964, US public officials have had to prove that what was said against them was made with \"knowledge that it was false or with reckless disregard for the truth\". \"The reason for that, when the Supreme Court passed this in 1964, is the chilling effect on journalism,\" said Mr Rusbridger. \"If a journalist makes a mistake, [and] this clearly was a mistake, if that ends up with their employers having to pay $1bn, $2bn, $3bn, that would be a dreadful chill on journalism. \"Unless Trump can prove that whoever this was who was editing this film did it with malice, the case is open and shut.\" Read more US news:'Earthquake in Team MAGA' as Trump ally turns enemyPrison staff fired after leaking Maxwell's emails, says lawyer Is he suing for too much money? Mr Trump says he's going to sue for between $1bn and $5bn, figures former BBC legal correspondent Clive Coleman described as \"very fanciful\". \"That, I think, is very fanciful because he will have to show that he has suffered billions of dollars worth of reputational damage. \"We know that this was back in 2020 when the speech was made. He went on to be successful in business and, of course, to be re-elected as US president.\"  However, Mr Coleman did suggest the BBC should try to \"bring this to an end as speedily as possible\". \"Litigation is always a commercial decision and it's a reputational decision,\" he said. \"The legal processes towards a court case are long and arduous and this is going to blow up in the news pretty regularly between now and then.\" Other news organisations facing litigation by Mr Trump have settled out of court for \"sums like $15m, $16m\", according to Mr Coleman."

        "Content": "\n          US correspondent\n              @skydavidblevins\n They say power is measured by the battles you choose to fight. This week Donald Trump chose two. One was an international clash with the BBC, the other, a messy family drama in his own backyard. His lawyers had threatened to sue the BBC for manipulating a speech he gave on 6 January 2021, by editing two different parts together to imply he incited violence. Read more: Three experts on why Trump might struggle to win BBC lawsuit The corporation apologised but when it refused to meet his $1bn demand for compensation, he upped it to \"between $1bn and $5bn\". Donald Trump has won out-of-court settlements from two US networks, but legal analysts are sceptical about his chances of a courtroom victory.  In the UK, the deadline for defamation claims has passed, and in Florida, he will have to prove enough people saw it to cause him reputational harm. \n                  Donald Trump confirms he will sue the BBC over Panorama edit - despite broadcaster's apology\n                 \n                  Trump to push ahead with BBC lawsuit: Three experts on why he might struggle to win\n                 \n                  Donald Trump withdraws support for Marjorie Taylor Greene after she calls for Epstein files to be released\n                 The BBC is protected by the First Amendment of the US constitution, and it is notoriously difficult to demonstrate malicious intent against a public figure. But for Trump, this may be less about winning a case and more about the optics - reinforcing his claims of \"fake news\".  On the other front is Marjorie Taylor Greene, once the most loyal of allies, even touted as a potential running mate. He publicly withdrew his endorsement of her on Truth Social, branding her \"wacky Marjorie\" and \"a ranting lunatic\". Read more: What do Epstein documents say about Trump, Andrew and Mandelson? The congresswoman hit back, claiming texts she had sent him about Jeffrey Epstein had \"sent him over the edge\". The split had been brewing, with Greene having aligned with Democrats to force a vote on the release of all Epstein files.  But the clash is not just personal, it's ideological, a signal that he's now more comfortable with less disruptive elements, even within his own base. With the BBC, he is wielding the legal threat to demand respect from one of the world's most respected news institutions. With Taylor Greene, he is showing that he can swiftly withdraw support in a bid to enforce discipline within his camp. Both battles come with risk. Suing the BBC could bring fresh scrutiny over his rhetoric on 6 January 2021. Read more on Jeffrey Epstein:Maxwell 'wants Trump to commute sentence'What Epstein's right-hand woman said about Trump and Andrew Disowning someone like Marjorie Taylor Greene could alienate the section of the MAGA base that rallied around her firebrand activism. But a high-profile battle with the BBC amplifies his narrative of persecution. And the ditching of a foot-soldier shows who wields the power when it comes to political survival."

        "Content": " The home secretary is set to unveil sweeping measures to tackle illegal migration, vowing to end the UK's 'golden ticket' for asylum seekers. People granted asylum in the UK will only be allowed to stay in the country temporarily, in the changes expected to be unveiled on Monday by Shabana Mahmood. Modelled on the Danish system, the aim is to make the UK less attractive for illegal immigrants and make it easier to deport them. Planned changes mean that refugee status will become temporary and subject to regular review, with refugees removed as soon as their home countries are deemed safe. The Home Office said the \"golden ticket\" deal has seen asylum claims surge in the UK, drawing people across Europe, through safe countries, onto dangerous small boats. Under current UK rules, those granted refugee status have it for five years and can then apply for indefinite leave to remain and get on a route to citizenship. As part of the changes, the statutory legal duty to provide asylum seeker support, including housing and weekly allowances, will be revoked. \n                  Refugee status set to become temporary in radical asylum reforms\n                 \n                  Reform's been pretty quiet since Labour started exploring Danish migration model - and this is why\n                 \n                  Denmark bans civilian drones as it ramps up security ahead of EU summit - as Sweden and France contribute equipment\n                 The government will seek to remove asylum support, including accommodation and handouts, to those who have a right to work and who can support themselves but choose not to or those who break UK law. 'Last chance for a decent politics' A government source said Ms Mahmood believes her reforms are about \"more than the electoral fortunes of her party\". \"This is the last chance for a decent, mainstream politics. If these moderate forces fail, she believes, something darker will follow,\" they said. \"But this demands that moderates are willing to do things that will seem immoderate to some. She has reminded those who are reluctant to embrace her ambition for bold reform, with an ultimatum: 'if you don't like this, you won't like what follows me.'\" Ms Mahmood said they were the most sweeping changes to the asylum system \"in a generation\", as she vowed the government will \"restore order and control to our borders\". The home secretary also told The Sunday Times that \"I can see - and I know my colleagues can - that illegal migration is tearing our country apart\". Read more:What Sky News witnessed after tip-off about migrant crossingsCould Danish model save Labour's bacon? System being 'gamed' The source said Ms Mahmood believes the system is being \"gamed by those travelling on boats or abusing legal visas\". Some 39,075 people have arrived in the UK after making the journey across the Channel so far this year, according to the latest Home Office figures.  That is an increase of 19% on the same point in 2024 and up 43% on 2023, but remains 5% lower than at the equivalent point in 2022, which remains the peak year for crossings. What happened in Denmark? The UK government points to Denmark remaining a signatory of the European Convention on Human Rights, while also cutting the number of asylum applications to the lowest number in 40 years and successfully removing 95% of rejected asylum seekers. Denmark has adopted increasingly restrictive rules in order to deal with migration over the last few years. In Denmark, most asylum or refugee statuses are temporary. Residency can be revoked once a country is deemed safe. In order to achieve settlement, asylum seekers are required to be in full-time employment, and the length of time it takes to acquire those rights has been extended. Denmark also has tougher rules on family reunification - both the sponsor and their partner are required to be at least 24 years old, which the Danish government says is designed to prevent forced marriages.\n The sponsor must also not have claimed welfare for three years and must provide a financial guarantee for their partner. Both must also pass a Danish language test. In 2018, Denmark introduced what it called a ghetto package, a controversial plan to radically alter some residential areas, including by demolishing social housing. Areas with over 1,000 residents were defined as ghettos if more than 50% were \"immigrants and their descendants from non-Western countries\". In 2021, the left of centre government passed a law that allowed refugees arriving on Danish soil to be moved to asylum centres in a partner country - and subsequently agreed with Rwanda to explore setting up a program, although that has been put on hold. Shadow home secretary Chris Philp said the Labour government has \"lost control\" of the UK's borders\" with illegal channel crossings \"surging to over 62,000 since the election\". He said some of the new measures were welcome but \"they stop well short of what is really required and some are just yet more gimmicks - like the previous 'smash the gangs' gimmick\". Mr Philp added: \"Only the Conservative borders plan will end illegal immigration - by leaving the ECHR, banning asylum claims for illegal immigrants, deporting all illegal arrivals within a week and establishing a Removals Force to deport 150,000 illegal immigrants each year.\" And Enver Solomon, chief executive of Refugee Council, said: \"These sweeping changes will not deter people from making dangerous crossings, but they will unfairly prevent men, women and children from putting down roots and integrating into British life.\" Ms Mahmood will be appearing on Sunday Morning with Trevor Phillips from 8.30am on Sunday."

Bafflement, anger, disappointment, and sheer frustration are all on relatively open display at the circular firing squad which seems to have surrounded the prime minister. The botched effort to flush out backroom plotters and force Wes Streeting to declare his loyalty ahead of the budget has instead led even previously loyal Starmerites to predict the PM could be forced out of office before the local elections in May. \"We have so many councillors coming up for election across the country,\" one says, \"and at the moment it looks like they're going to be wiped out. That's our base - we just can't afford to lose them. I like Keir [Starmer] but there's only a limited window left to turn things around.

She screwed up on the manifesto. She screwed up on the last two fiscal events, costing the party huge amounts of support and leaving the economy stagnating. \"Having now walked everyone up the mountain of tax rises and made us vote to support them on the opposition day debate two days ago, she's now worried her job is at risk and has bottled it. \"Talk to any major business or investor and they are holding off investing in the UK until it is clear what the UK's tax policy is going to be, putting us in a situation where the chancellor is going to have to go through this all over again in six months - which just means no real economic growth for another six months.\" Read more:Starmer and Reeves ditch plans to raise income taxFormer chancellor Osborne is shock contender to head HSBC After less than 18 months in office, the government is stuck in a political morass largely of its own making.

If you don't do it, you don't stop it from happening again with other people.\" \n                  Trump to push ahead with BBC lawsuit: Three experts on why he might struggle to win\n                 \n                  Union demands Sir Robbie Gibb's removal from BBC board to defend 'political impartiality'\n                 \n                  Why does BBC board’s Sir Robbie Gibb keep getting criticised?\n                  The Daily Telegraph reported earlier this month that an internal memo raised concerns about the BBC's editing of a speech made by Mr Trump on 6 January 2021, just before a mob rioted at the US Capitol building, on the news programme. The concerns regard clips spliced together from sections of the president's speech to make it appear he told supporters he was going to walk to the US Capitol with them to \"fight like hell\" in the documentary Trump: A Second Chance?, which was broadcast by the BBC the week before last year's US election. Following a backlash, both BBC director-general Tim Davie and BBC News chief executive Deborah Turness resigned from their roles. 'No basis for defamation claim' On Thursday, the broadcaster officially apologised to the president and added that it was an \"error of judgement\" and the programme will \"not be broadcast again in this form on any BBC platforms\". A spokesperson said that \"the BBC sincerely regrets the manner in which the video clip was edited,\" but they also added that \"we strongly disagree there is a basis for a defamation claim\". Earlier this week, Mr Trump's lawyers threatened to sue the BBC for $1bn unless it apologised, retracted the clip, and compensated him. Legal challenges But legal experts have said that Mr Trump would face challenges taking the case to court in the UK or the US. The deadline to bring the case to UK courts, where defamation damages rarely exceed £100,000 ($132,000), has already expired because the documentary aired in October 2024, which is more than one year. Also because the documentary was not shown in the US, it would be hard to show that Americans thought less of the president because of a programme they could not watch.

        "Content": "\n          US correspondent\n              @skydavidblevins\n  It is an earthquake for the MAGA ecosystem. Donald Trump and Marjorie Taylor Greene were a formidable alliance on the Republican Party's hard-right flank. For years, the congresswoman for Georgia embodied the combative, conspiracy-tinged politics that define Trump's presidency. She called him \"the father of the America First movement,\" campaigned to be his running mate, and was quick to defend him. \"David Cameron can kiss my ass,\" she told Sky News when asked about the former UK prime minister's concerns about US fading support for Ukraine. Door-stepped by my colleague Martha Kelner, she said: \"We don't give a crap about your country or your reporting. \"The Trump administration is doing a great job and I stand by their statements,\" she added. \n                  Police pantomime and migrants shopping for life jackets: Inside the route to the Channel\n                 \n                  COP30: Climate protest in Brazil's city of Belem aims to hold governments' feet to the fire\n                 \n                  Storm Claudia latest: Major incident declared due to severe flooding; British woman killed in Albufeira\n                 \"I'm thankful to President Trump that he is leading us out of wars.\" Watch Sky's Martha Kelner clash with Taylor Greene earlier this year... But in recent months, she had expressed concerns about Trump's involvement in the Middle East, Ukraine and elsewhere. It escalated when she stood with victims of sex offender Jeffrey Epstein to demand justice and joined Democrats in demanding a vote on the release of all files. Just days ago, President Trump told reporters Taylor Greene had \"lost her way\", but something triggered a war of words late on Friday.  The president had taken questions on Air Force One, with two reporters citing Taylor Greene's demand that the files be released. Moments later, President Trump posted on Truth Social that he was withdrawing his endorsement of the congresswoman. He branded her a \"ranting lunatic\", \"wacky Marjorie\", and said all she ever does is \"COMPLAIN, COMPLAIN, COMPLAIN.\" Her reply came very quickly, in a post claiming she had sent the president text messages about Jeffrey Epstein. \"Apparently this is what sent him over the edge. The Epstein Files,\" she posted. Read more on Jeffrey Epstein:Ghislaine Maxwell 'wants Trump to commute sentence'What Epstein's right-hand woman said about Trump and Andrew She accused him of \"coming after\" her to \"scare all the other Republicans\" before next week's vote to release the Epstein files. \"It's astonishing how hard he's fighting to stop the Epstein files from coming out that he actually goes to this level,\" she added. For years, they were joined at the hip - Trump the movement's figurehead, Taylor Greene its megaphone - but it has now descended into open hostility. Epstein, the story that won't go away, has just cost Trump one of his most loyal allies, and rocked the internal dynamics of his political movement."

Hawkers brought carts selling bananas, mangoes and coconuts - while demonstrators bore umbrellas, hats and fans to shelter from the scorching tropical sun. After a week of dreary negotiations at the COP30 climate talks, the streets were alive with the drumming of maracatu music and dancing to local carimbo rhythms on Saturday. It was a carnival atmosphere designed to elevate sober issues. Among those out on the streets were Kayapo people, an indigenous community living across the states of Para and Mato Grosso - the latter at the frontier of soy expansion in the Brazilian Amazon. They are fighting local infrastructure projects like the new Ferrograo railway that will transport soy through their homeland. The soy industry raises much-needed cash for Brazil's economy - its second biggest export - but the kayapo say they do not get a slice of the benefit. \n                  Dozens of protesters storm COP30 venue in Brazil\n                 \n                  Is there a rift brewing in the special relationship?\n                 \n                  California governor Gavin Newsom accuses Donald Trump of 'abdicating responsibility' over green energy at COP30\n                 Read more:Cop out: Is net zero dead?COP30: Are climate summits saving the world - or just hot air? Uti, a Kayapo community leader, said: \"We do not accept the construction of the Ferrograo and some other projects. \"We Kayapo do not accept any of this being built on indigenous land.\" Many Brazilian indigenous and community groups here want legal recognition of the rights to their land - and on Friday, the Brazilian government agreed to designate two more territories to the Mundurucu people. It's a Brazilian lens on global issues - indigenous peoples are widely regarded as the best stewards of the land, but rarely rewarded for their efforts. In fact, it is often a terrible opposite: grandmother Julia Chunil Catricura had been fighting to stay on Mapuche land in southern Chile, but disappeared earlier this year when she went out for a walk. Lefimilla Catalina, also Mapuche, said she's travelled two days to be here in Belem to raise the case of Julia, and to forge alliances with other groups. \"At least [COP30] makes it visible\" to the world that people are \"facing conflicts\" on their land, she said. She added: \"COP offers a tiny space [for indigenous people], and we want to be more involved. \"We want to have more influence, and that's why we believe we have to take ownership of these spaces, we can't stay out of it.\" They are joined by climate protesters from around the world in an effort to hold governments' feet to the fire. Louise Hutchins, convener of Make Polluters Pay Coalition International, said: \"We're here to say to governments they need to make the oil and gas companies pay up for the climate destruction - they've made billions in profits every day for the last 50 years.\" After three years of COPs with no protests - the UAE, Egypt, and Azerbaijan do not look kindly on people taking to the streets - this year demonstrators have defined the look, the tone and the soundtrack of the COP30 climate talks - and Saturday was no different. Whether that will translate into anything more ambitious to come out of COP30 remains to be seen, with another week of negotiations still to go. For now, the protests in Belem reflect the chaos, the mess and the beauty of Brazil, the COP process, and the rest of the world beyond."

Footage from a holiday campsite in Albufeira, where an 85-year-old British woman was killed, shows the extent of the damage caused by the extreme winds, which reached up to 114kmph in Portugal's southern region of the Algarve. Regional commander of the Algarve, Vitor Vaz Pinto, said dozens of people were injured in the area after Storm Claudia hit, two of whom were seriously injured. The injured were of Portuguese, Spanish and British nationalities and ranged in age from six to 85 years old.

Portuguese media described the extreme weather in the Algarve as a tornado. The storm, which was named by the Spanish meteorological service, affected Portugal and parts of Spain, Britain and Ireland. Sky News' weather presenter Jo Wheeler said the IPMA, or Portuguese Institute for the Sea and Atmosphere, had issued red rain warnings and severe wind warnings \"well ahead of the storm's arrival\". She said there have been more than 2,434 weather-related incidents reported in the Algarve, including a downburst - a strong downward rush of air from a thunderstorm, causing similar damage to a tornado but linear rather than rotational -at Praia da Carvoeiro, with wind gusts of 114 km/hour.

Senedd Member Peter Fox described the impact as being \"devastating\".

Natural Resources Wales has issued 11 flood warnings, four of which are severe, as well as 17 flood alerts. In England, according to the Environment Agency's latest update, there were 49 active flood warnings and 134 flood alerts."

Earlier this week, Mr Trump accused the MAGA loyalist of \"catering to the other side\" after she criticised his focus on foreign policy, which she described as \"America Last\".

Following a conviction for soliciting prostitution from a minor in 2008, he was registered as a sex offender.

Parker, 33, has said he is \"confident\" he will be cleared after a routine test given to the Voluntary Anti-Doping Agency detected traces of cocaine.

        "Content": "By Bethany Minelle, news reporter  Airline Blue Islands has suspended trading, cancelling all flights. Just a day ahead of Friday's announcement, the company had shared an advert, recruiting for roles including pilots, engineers and head of cabin crew. Confirming the closure on its website, it wrote: \" We regret to inform you that Blue Islands has suspended trading effective on 14 November 2025. All future flights operated by Blue Islands have been cancelled.\" The company warned those with tickets to fly not to travel to the airport unless they had made alternative travel arrangements. It told customers: \"We deeply regret the inconvenience that this will bring to your travel plans\". The Channel Islands-based regional airline had bases in Jersey and Guernsey, and flew to Southampton, Bristol, East Midlands, Exeter, Dublin, Newcastle and Norwich, and also to Paris and Bruges. It had employed about 100 people. \n                  COVID-19: Guernsey tells dance festival goers to isolate as coronavirus cases spike\n                 \n                  'One occupant visible' in Emiliano Sala plane wreckage - investigators\n                 \n                  German soldiers return to Guernsey for first time since WWII occupation\n                 Blue Islands advised disappointed travellers who had booked directly with the airline to contact their bank or credit card provider, or their travel agent or holiday company if booked through a third party. Rescue fares and medical help Several airlines stepped in to help stranded customers. Blue Islands' codeshare partner Aurigny scheduled 10 additional services between Guernsey and Southampton and eight additional services between Guernsey and Jersey between Saturday and Wednesday. While Glasgow-based regional airline Loganair introduced special rescue fares for affected passengers on selected routes from Sunday. With the airline offering a vital service for patients needing hospital treatment in the UK, Health and Care Jersey (HCJ) said it would be contacting patients with upcoming UK clinical appointments, or those who had already travelled to the UK for treatment. Airline closure should be a 'wake-up call' During the Covid pandemic, Blue Islands borrowed £8.5m from the government of Jersey to help secure and maintain vital lifeline services. A Jersey audit office report showed £7m was still owed last summer. Formed initially in 1999 as Le Cocq's Air Link to supply perishable goods to the Channel Island of Alderney from Bournemouth using Britten Norman Islanders, the company took its first passengers in 2002. Trading under the name Rockhopper from 2003, it rebranded in 2006 as Blue Islands. Ten years later the company became a Flybe franchise partner, restoring its name again in 2020 when Flybe closed. Commenting on Blue Islands' demise, Guernsey Hospitality Association president and director Alan Sillett wrote on social media: \"Tonight's news should be a real wake-up call. Guernsey's air links model is likely to go from an 85% monopoly to a 100% monopoly. \"This shows our lack of resilience. We need major airlines to enter the market. Regional airlines are very fragile unless they have a bailout option.\" A spokesperson for Blue Islands said: \"After 26 years of serving the Channel Islands, we deeply regret that Blue Islands has this evening suspended its operations. \"After very constructive dialogue with the government of Jersey in recent months, including what we understood to have been ongoing assessments of the future options, we were informed this afternoon that they are unable to provide further support. \"This has meant that we now need to suspend flying immediately whilst we consider the options available and how we can help our customers, staff and stakeholders.\" Earlier this week, Sky News presenter Jonathan Samuels wrote about the dramatic fall in domestic UK flights, with the figure more than halving over the past two decades."

Not that they couldn't have not done that. They cheated. They changed the words coming out of my mouth.\" Mr Trump then told reporters he would discuss the matter with Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer over the weekend, and claimed \"the people of the UK are very angry about what happened... because it shows the BBC is fake news\". Separately, Mr Trump told GB News: \"I'm not looking to get into lawsuits, but I think I have an obligation to do it. \"This was so egregious.

The concerns regard clips spliced together from sections of the president's speech to make it appear he told supporters he was going to walk to the US Capitol with them to \"fight like hell\" in the documentary Trump: A Second Chance?, which was broadcast by the BBC the week before last year's US election. Following a backlash, both BBC director-general Tim Davie and BBC News chief executive Deborah Turness resigned from their roles. 'No basis for defamation claim' On Thursday, the broadcaster officially apologised to the president and added that it was an \"error of judgement\" and the programme will \"not be broadcast again in this form on any BBC platforms\". A spokesperson said that \"the BBC sincerely regrets the manner in which the video clip was edited,\" but they also added that \"we strongly disagree there is a basis for a defamation claim\". Earlier this week, Mr Trump's lawyers threatened to sue the BBC for $1bn unless it apologised, retracted the clip, and compensated him. Legal challenges But legal experts have said that Mr Trump would face challenges taking the case to court in the UK or the US. The deadline to bring the case to UK courts, where defamation damages rarely exceed £100,000 ($132,000), has already expired because the documentary aired in October 2024, which is more than one year. Also because the documentary was not shown in the US, it would be hard to show that Americans thought less of the president because of a programme they could not watch.

A BBC spokesperson said: \"The BBC holds itself to the highest editorial standards. This matter has been brought to our attention and we are now looking into it.\""

        "Content": "Donald Trump has confirmed he plans to sue the BBC for between $1bn and $5bn over the editing of his speech in a Panorama news programme. The corporation said it was an \"error of judgement\" to splice two sections of his speech together, and the programme will \"not be broadcast again in this form on any BBC platforms\". \"We have to do it, they've even admitted that they cheated,\" the US president told reporters overnight on Saturday. \"Not that they couldn't have not done that. They cheated. They changed the words coming out of my mouth.\" However, the lawsuit will not be easy, according to three experts who have spoken to Sky News. \"Filing a lawsuit is easy,\" said Mark Stevens, media law solicitor at Howard Kennedy, to Sky presenter Samantha Washington. \"Winning one is, in this case, like trying to lasso a tornado: technically possible, but you're going to need more than a cowboy hat.\" So why would this case be so hard to win? Where did the damage occur? The Panorama episode was not aired in the US, which may make Mr Trump's case harder. \"For a libel claim to succeed, harm must occur where the case is brought,\" said Mr Stevens. \"It's hard to argue [for] that reputational damage in a jurisdiction where the content wasn't aired.\"  The president will also have to show that his reputation suffered actual harm. \"But his reputation was pretty damaged on this issue before,\" said Mr Stevens. \"There have been judicial findings, congressional hearings, global media coverage around 6 January. Laying that responsibility for any further harm at the door of the BBC seems pretty tenuous.\" Was the mistake malicious? In order to sue someone for libel in the US, you have to prove they did it on purpose - or with 'malicious intent'. That might be hard to prove, according to Alan Rusbridger, editor of Prospect magazine and former editor-in-chief of the Guardian.  \"I just don't think that he can do that,\" he said. Since 1964, US public officials have had to prove that what was said against them was made with \"knowledge that it was false or with reckless disregard for the truth\". \"The reason for that, when the Supreme Court passed this in 1964, is the chilling effect on journalism,\" said Mr Rusbridger. \"If a journalist makes a mistake, [and] this clearly was a mistake, if that ends up with their employers having to pay $1bn, $2bn, $3bn, that would be a dreadful chill on journalism. \"Unless Trump can prove that whoever this was who was editing this film did it with malice, the case is open and shut.\" Read more US news:'Earthquake in Team MAGA' as Trump ally turns enemyPrison staff fired after leaking Maxwell's emails, says lawyer Is he suing for too much money? Mr Trump says he's going to sue for between $1bn and $5bn, figures former BBC legal correspondent Clive Coleman described as \"very fanciful\". \"That, I think, is very fanciful because he will have to show that he has suffered billions of dollars worth of reputational damage. \"We know that this was back in 2020 when the speech was made. He went on to be successful in business and, of course, to be re-elected as US president.\"  However, Mr Coleman did suggest the BBC should try to \"bring this to an end as speedily as possible\". \"Litigation is always a commercial decision and it's a reputational decision,\" he said. \"The legal processes towards a court case are long and arduous and this is going to blow up in the news pretty regularly between now and then.\" Other news organisations facing litigation by Mr Trump have settled out of court for \"sums like $15m, $16m\", according to Mr Coleman."

In comments made on Truth Social, Mr Trump said he would support any challenger who wants to take Ms Greene's seat in Georgia.

Read more: Marjorie Taylor Greene - the MAGA ally known for embracing conspiracies and insulting journalists After the US government shutdown ended, a petition to vote on the full release of the files about disgraced pedophile financier Epstein received enough signatures - including Ms Greene's - to bring it to a vote in the House of Representatives. While such a vote does not yet have a date, Mr Trump has called the files a \"hoax\" and accused the Democrats of using them \"to try and deflect from their disastrous SHUTDOWN\".

Earlier this week, Mr Trump accused the MAGA loyalist of \"catering to the other side\" after she criticised his focus on foreign policy, which she described as \"America Last\".  Epstein took his own life in prison in 2019 while awaiting a trial for sex trafficking charges and was accused of running a \"vast network\" of underage girls for sex. He pleaded not guilty. Following a conviction for soliciting prostitution from a minor in 2008, he was registered as a sex offender. It comes after Democrats on the House Oversight Committee published several emails, which they said \"raises questions about Trump and Epstein's relationship, Trump's knowledge of Epstein's crimes\", and the president's relationship to Epstein's victims. Mr Trump has consistently denied knowledge of Epstein's crimes and called claims linking him to the financier a \"hoax\".

But for Trump, this may be less about winning a case and more about the optics - reinforcing his claims of \"fake news\".

But the clash is not just personal, it's ideological, a signal that he's now more comfortable with less disruptive elements, even within his own base. With the BBC, he is wielding the legal threat to demand respect from one of the world's most respected news institutions. With Taylor Greene, he is showing that he can swiftly withdraw support in a bid to enforce discipline within his camp. Both battles come with risk. Suing the BBC could bring fresh scrutiny over his rhetoric on 6 January 2021.

Donald Trump and Marjorie Taylor Greene were a formidable alliance on the Republican Party's hard-right flank. For years, the congresswoman for Georgia embodied the combative, conspiracy-tinged politics that define Trump's presidency. She called him \"the father of the America First movement,\" campaigned to be his running mate, and was quick to defend him. \"David Cameron can kiss my ass,\" she told Sky News when asked about the former UK prime minister's concerns about US fading support for Ukraine.

But in recent months, she had expressed concerns about Trump's involvement in the Middle East, Ukraine and elsewhere. It escalated when she stood with victims of sex offender Jeffrey Epstein to demand justice and joined Democrats in demanding a vote on the release of all files. Just days ago, President Trump told reporters Taylor Greene had \"lost her way\", but something triggered a war of words late on Friday.  The president had taken questions on Air Force One, with two reporters citing Taylor Greene's demand that the files be released. Moments later, President Trump posted on Truth Social that he was withdrawing his endorsement of the congresswoman. He branded her a \"ranting lunatic\", \"wacky Marjorie\", and said all she ever does is \"COMPLAIN, COMPLAIN, COMPLAIN.\" Her reply came very quickly, in a post claiming she had sent the president text messages about Jeffrey Epstein. \"Apparently this is what sent him over the edge.

For years, they were joined at the hip - Trump the movement's figurehead, Taylor Greene its megaphone - but it has now descended into open hostility. Epstein, the story that won't go away, has just cost Trump one of his most loyal allies, and rocked the internal dynamics of his political movement."

It comes after Maxwell's \"privileged client-attorney email correspondence\" was allegedly shared. The co-conspirator of the late billionaire paedophile Jeffrey Epstein was sentenced to 20 years in jail in 2022 for sex trafficking after recruiting young girls for her financier ex-boyfriend during the 1990s and early 2000s. She was moved from a low-security facility in Tallahassee, Florida, to Federal Prison Camp Bryan in August, a week after she met deputy attorney general Todd Blanche and Maxwell's lawyer David Oscar Markus.

But Ms Saffian claimed Maxwell \"has not requested a commutation - or made a pardon - application to the second Trump administration\". Maxwell was convicted on five sex trafficking-related counts in 2021. She appealed the conviction, but the Supreme Court rejected her challenge in early October.

        "Content": " The home secretary is set to unveil sweeping measures to tackle illegal migration, vowing to end the UK's 'golden ticket' for asylum seekers. People granted asylum in the UK will only be allowed to stay in the country temporarily, in the changes expected to be unveiled on Monday by Shabana Mahmood. Modelled on the Danish system, the aim is to make the UK less attractive for illegal immigrants and make it easier to deport them. Planned changes mean that refugee status will become temporary and subject to regular review, with refugees removed as soon as their home countries are deemed safe. The Home Office said the \"golden ticket\" deal has seen asylum claims surge in the UK, drawing people across Europe, through safe countries, onto dangerous small boats. Under current UK rules, those granted refugee status have it for five years and can then apply for indefinite leave to remain and get on a route to citizenship. As part of the changes, the statutory legal duty to provide asylum seeker support, including housing and weekly allowances, will be revoked. \n                  Refugee status set to become temporary in radical asylum reforms\n                 \n                  Reform's been pretty quiet since Labour started exploring Danish migration model - and this is why\n                 \n                  Denmark bans civilian drones as it ramps up security ahead of EU summit - as Sweden and France contribute equipment\n                 The government will seek to remove asylum support, including accommodation and handouts, to those who have a right to work and who can support themselves but choose not to or those who break UK law. 'Last chance for a decent politics' A government source said Ms Mahmood believes her reforms are about \"more than the electoral fortunes of her party\". \"This is the last chance for a decent, mainstream politics. If these moderate forces fail, she believes, something darker will follow,\" they said. \"But this demands that moderates are willing to do things that will seem immoderate to some. She has reminded those who are reluctant to embrace her ambition for bold reform, with an ultimatum: 'if you don't like this, you won't like what follows me.'\" Ms Mahmood said they were the most sweeping changes to the asylum system \"in a generation\", as she vowed the government will \"restore order and control to our borders\". The home secretary also told The Sunday Times that \"I can see - and I know my colleagues can - that illegal migration is tearing our country apart\". Read more:What Sky News witnessed after tip-off about migrant crossingsCould Danish model save Labour's bacon? System being 'gamed' The source said Ms Mahmood believes the system is being \"gamed by those travelling on boats or abusing legal visas\". Some 39,075 people have arrived in the UK after making the journey across the Channel so far this year, according to the latest Home Office figures.  That is an increase of 19% on the same point in 2024 and up 43% on 2023, but remains 5% lower than at the equivalent point in 2022, which remains the peak year for crossings. What happened in Denmark? The UK government points to Denmark remaining a signatory of the European Convention on Human Rights, while also cutting the number of asylum applications to the lowest number in 40 years and successfully removing 95% of rejected asylum seekers. Denmark has adopted increasingly restrictive rules in order to deal with migration over the last few years. In Denmark, most asylum or refugee statuses are temporary. Residency can be revoked once a country is deemed safe. In order to achieve settlement, asylum seekers are required to be in full-time employment, and the length of time it takes to acquire those rights has been extended. Denmark also has tougher rules on family reunification - both the sponsor and their partner are required to be at least 24 years old, which the Danish government says is designed to prevent forced marriages.\n The sponsor must also not have claimed welfare for three years and must provide a financial guarantee for their partner. Both must also pass a Danish language test. In 2018, Denmark introduced what it called a ghetto package, a controversial plan to radically alter some residential areas, including by demolishing social housing. Areas with over 1,000 residents were defined as ghettos if more than 50% were \"immigrants and their descendants from non-Western countries\". In 2021, the left of centre government passed a law that allowed refugees arriving on Danish soil to be moved to asylum centres in a partner country - and subsequently agreed with Rwanda to explore setting up a program, although that has been put on hold. Shadow home secretary Chris Philp said the Labour government has \"lost control\" of the UK's borders\" with illegal channel crossings \"surging to over 62,000 since the election\". He said some of the new measures were welcome but \"they stop well short of what is really required and some are just yet more gimmicks - like the previous 'smash the gangs' gimmick\". Mr Philp added: \"Only the Conservative borders plan will end illegal immigration - by leaving the ECHR, banning asylum claims for illegal immigrants, deporting all illegal arrivals within a week and establishing a Removals Force to deport 150,000 illegal immigrants each year.\" And Enver Solomon, chief executive of Refugee Council, said: \"These sweeping changes will not deter people from making dangerous crossings, but they will unfairly prevent men, women and children from putting down roots and integrating into British life.\" Ms Mahmood will be appearing on Sunday Morning with Trevor Phillips from 8.30am on Sunday."

        "Content": "\n          Political correspondent\n              @amandaakass\n Many Labour MPs have been left shellshocked after the chaotic political self-sabotage of the past week. Bafflement, anger, disappointment, and sheer frustration are all on relatively open display at the circular firing squad which seems to have surrounded the prime minister. The botched effort to flush out backroom plotters and force Wes Streeting to declare his loyalty ahead of the budget has instead led even previously loyal Starmerites to predict the PM could be forced out of office before the local elections in May. \"We have so many councillors coming up for election across the country,\" one says, \"and at the moment it looks like they're going to be wiped out. That's our base - we just can't afford to lose them. I like Keir [Starmer] but there's only a limited window left to turn things around. There's a real question of urgency.\" Another criticised a \"boys club\" at No 10 who they claimed have \"undermined\" the prime minister and \"forgotten they're meant to be serving the British people.\" There's clearly widespread muttering about what to do next - and even a degree of enviousness at the lack of a regicidal 1922 committee mechanism, as enjoyed by the Tories. \"Leadership speculation is destabilising,\" one said. \"But there's really no obvious strategy. Andy Burnham isn't even an MP. You'd need a stalking horse candidate and we don't have one. There's no 1922. It's very messy.\" \n                  Gordon Brown 'confident' of two-child benefit cap change - as he calls for gambling tax to pay for it\n                 \n                  Starmer says Lammy 'setting out facts to best of his knowledge' on prisoner releases\n                 \n                  Labour's dilemma: The two-child benefit cap\n                 Others are gunning for the chancellor after months of careful pitch-rolling for manifesto-breaching tax rises in the budget were ripped up overnight. \"Her career is toast,\" one told me. \"Rachel has just lost all credibility. She screwed up on the manifesto. She screwed up on the last two fiscal events, costing the party huge amounts of support and leaving the economy stagnating. \"Having now walked everyone up the mountain of tax rises and made us vote to support them on the opposition day debate two days ago, she's now worried her job is at risk and has bottled it. \"Talk to any major business or investor and they are holding off investing in the UK until it is clear what the UK's tax policy is going to be, putting us in a situation where the chancellor is going to have to go through this all over again in six months - which just means no real economic growth for another six months.\" Read more:Starmer and Reeves ditch plans to raise income taxFormer chancellor Osborne is shock contender to head HSBC After less than 18 months in office, the government is stuck in a political morass largely of its own making. Treasury sources have belatedly argued that the chancellor's pre-budget change of heart on income tax is down to better-than-expected economic forecasts from the Office for Budget Responsibility. That should be a cause of celebration. The question is whether she and the PM are now too damaged to make that case to the country - and rescue their benighted prospects."

Hawkers brought carts selling bananas, mangoes and coconuts - while demonstrators bore umbrellas, hats and fans to shelter from the scorching tropical sun. After a week of dreary negotiations at the COP30 climate talks, the streets were alive with the drumming of maracatu music and dancing to local carimbo rhythms on Saturday. It was a carnival atmosphere designed to elevate sober issues. Among those out on the streets were Kayapo people, an indigenous community living across the states of Para and Mato Grosso - the latter at the frontier of soy expansion in the Brazilian Amazon. They are fighting local infrastructure projects like the new Ferrograo railway that will transport soy through their homeland. The soy industry raises much-needed cash for Brazil's economy - its second biggest export - but the kayapo say they do not get a slice of the benefit. \n                  Dozens of protesters storm COP30 venue in Brazil\n                 \n                  Is there a rift brewing in the special relationship?\n                 \n                  California governor Gavin Newsom accuses Donald Trump of 'abdicating responsibility' over green energy at COP30\n                 Read more:Cop out: Is net zero dead?COP30: Are climate summits saving the world - or just hot air? Uti, a Kayapo community leader, said: \"We do not accept the construction of the Ferrograo and some other projects. \"We Kayapo do not accept any of this being built on indigenous land.\" Many Brazilian indigenous and community groups here want legal recognition of the rights to their land - and on Friday, the Brazilian government agreed to designate two more territories to the Mundurucu people. It's a Brazilian lens on global issues - indigenous peoples are widely regarded as the best stewards of the land, but rarely rewarded for their efforts. In fact, it is often a terrible opposite: grandmother Julia Chunil Catricura had been fighting to stay on Mapuche land in southern Chile, but disappeared earlier this year when she went out for a walk. Lefimilla Catalina, also Mapuche, said she's travelled two days to be here in Belem to raise the case of Julia, and to forge alliances with other groups. \"At least [COP30] makes it visible\" to the world that people are \"facing conflicts\" on their land, she said. She added: \"COP offers a tiny space [for indigenous people], and we want to be more involved. \"We want to have more influence, and that's why we believe we have to take ownership of these spaces, we can't stay out of it.\" They are joined by climate protesters from around the world in an effort to hold governments' feet to the fire. Louise Hutchins, convener of Make Polluters Pay Coalition International, said: \"We're here to say to governments they need to make the oil and gas companies pay up for the climate destruction - they've made billions in profits every day for the last 50 years.\" After three years of COPs with no protests - the UAE, Egypt, and Azerbaijan do not look kindly on people taking to the streets - this year demonstrators have defined the look, the tone and the soundtrack of the COP30 climate talks - and Saturday was no different. Whether that will translate into anything more ambitious to come out of COP30 remains to be seen, with another week of negotiations still to go. For now, the protests in Belem reflect the chaos, the mess and the beauty of Brazil, the COP process, and the rest of the world beyond."

        "Content": "\n          Arts and entertainment producer\n        \"I felt scared and I felt alone and I felt entirely limited at various points in my life\", actor Jonathan Bailey says of growing up gay in school.  While promoting Wicked: For Good, the actor donated one of his interview slots to talk about the charity he is a patron of: Just Like Us, which works with LGBT+ youth in schools. \"That's something that I would have really benefited from when I was young,\" he said, talking exclusively to Sky News about his charitable work. In surveys of thousands of UK pupils, Just Like Us found that LGBT participants aged 11 to 18 were twice as likely to suffer anxiety, depression and to be bullied, and that only half felt safe at school on a daily basis. \"I experienced all of that,\" he said. \"It became clear quite early on that something that was very specific and clear to me about who I was, it wasn't safe and it wasn't celebrated.\" Whether as Lord Anthony in Bridgerton, being crowned sexiest man alive and as the Winkie Prince Fiyero in Wicked: For Good, Bailey has broken through an outdated stereotype. Historically, it was considered a career risk to be out - a heterosexual romantic lead's career was at risk if his sexuality was public. \n                  Manchester Pride put into voluntary liquidation and being assessed by regulator\n                 \n                  Thousands defy ban to join Pride march in Budapest\n                 \n                  Tom Daley says 'it's scary how LGBT rights are being dangerously threatened'\n                 For the Winkie prince actor, education can play a role in defying limitations. \"This is beyond sexuality,\" he said, \"it's race, it's class, it is where you're from, we are all given limiting narratives that we have to break free of. \"I thought not only was I not going to be able to play these sorts of parts because of my sexuality, but that I wouldn't be able to do Shakespeare because I didn't go to drama school. \"They're the sort of stories that we need to be reminded of is that actually standing up and being safe enough to be able to say who you really are, and to be vulnerable at that age... these formative years, is inspiring to everyone in the classroom.\" But classrooms in the UK are facing tightening budgets due to \"spiralling costs\" that threaten to outstrip the growth in school funding. Citing budget and time pressures on teachers, Just Like Us has made its talks free in schools. Does the actor think the government should be doing more? He said: \"I'm a very proud brother of an incredible teacher who works in the state system, and I know how much she cares about her school, her pupils. \"The resources are being crunched, and the problem is that it will be the arts and it will be really important conversations that Just Like Us bring into the schools and these... things that are going to go, and that's just really sad. \"But I'm not the person to come up with solutions other than I can do my bit.\" Bailey, Cynthia Erivo and Bowen Yang are among Wicked's LGBT cast, and in Wicked: For Good, openly gay actor Colman Domingo joins them as the voice of the Cowardly Lion. But not everyone is encouraging the onscreen representation: A \"warning\" by conservative group One Million Moms said that the Jon M Chu-directed films are \"normalising the LGBTQ lifestyle\" to children and takes aim at the cast. The alert urges people to boycott the sequel \"even if you have seen Wicked: Part One\".

        "Content": " Donald Trump has said he will sue the BBC for between $1bn and $5bn over the editing of his speech on Panorama. The US president confirmed he would be taking legal action against the broadcaster while on Air Force One overnight on Saturday. \"We'll sue them. We'll sue them for anywhere between a billion (£792m) and five billion dollars (£3.79bn), probably sometime next week,\" he told reporters. \"We have to do it, they've even admitted that they cheated. Not that they couldn't have not done that. They cheated. They changed the words coming out of my mouth.\" Mr Trump then told reporters he would discuss the matter with Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer over the weekend, and claimed \"the people of the UK are very angry about what happened... because it shows the BBC is fake news\". Separately, Mr Trump told GB News: \"I'm not looking to get into lawsuits, but I think I have an obligation to do it. \"This was so egregious.

The concerns regard clips spliced together from sections of the president's speech to make it appear he told supporters he was going to walk to the US Capitol with them to \"fight like hell\" in the documentary Trump: A Second Chance?, which was broadcast by the BBC the week before last year's US election. Following a backlash, both BBC director-general Tim Davie and BBC News chief executive Deborah Turness resigned from their roles. 'No basis for defamation claim' On Thursday, the broadcaster officially apologised to the president and added that it was an \"error of judgement\" and the programme will \"not be broadcast again in this form on any BBC platforms\". A spokesperson said that \"the BBC sincerely regrets the manner in which the video clip was edited,\" but they also added that \"we strongly disagree there is a basis for a defamation claim\". Earlier this week, Mr Trump's lawyers threatened to sue the BBC for $1bn unless it apologised, retracted the clip, and compensated him. Legal challenges But legal experts have said that Mr Trump would face challenges taking the case to court in the UK or the US. The deadline to bring the case to UK courts, where defamation damages rarely exceed £100,000 ($132,000), has already expired because the documentary aired in October 2024, which is more than one year. Also because the documentary was not shown in the US, it would be hard to show that Americans thought less of the president because of a programme they could not watch.
