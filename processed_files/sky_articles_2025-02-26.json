        "Content": "\n          Political editor\n              @BethRigby\n Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer brushed aside growing tensions between the White House and Europe over Ukraine on Wednesday, saying he trusted Donald Trump and wanted the \"special relationship\" to go \"from strength to strength\". Speaking to reporters ahead of a crucial meeting at the White House, Sir Keir insisted that the UK was working \"in lockstep\" with the president on the matter of Ukraine. Asked if he could trust President Trump in light of what has happened in recent weeks, the prime minister replied \"yes\". \"I've got a good relationship with him,\" Sir Keir said. \"As you know, I've met him, I've spoken to him on the phone, and this relationship between our two countries is a special relationship with a long history, forged as we fought wars together, as we traded together. \"And as I say, I want it to go from strength to strength.\" Politics latest: PM's 'very stupid decision' condemned The prime minister has now arrived in Washington, but even before he touched down, the choreography of the trip hit a little turbulence as President Trump appeared to pour cold water on the prospect of a US military backstop for Ukraine as part of any peace deal - a key UK and European demand.  \"I'm not going to make security guarantees beyond very much,\" Mr Trump said at his first cabinet meeting on Wednesday. \"We're going to have Europe do that because Europe is the next-door neighbour.\" His remarks seemed at odds with those made by the prime minister on the way to Washington as he reiterated how important a US military backstop was for Ukraine. \"We all want a peaceful outcome,\" the prime minister said. \"It's got to be a lasting peace, and that requires us to put in place an effective security guarantee. \"Exactly what the configuration of that is, exactly what the backstop is, is obviously the subject of intense discussion.\" He added: \"But the reason I say the backstop is so important is that the security guarantee has to be sufficient to deter Putin from coming again because my concern is if there is a ceasefire without a backstop, it will simply give him the opportunity to wait and to come again because his ambition in relation to Ukraine is pretty obvious, I think, for all to see.\" Read more:CIA asked to look at UK 'order'Trump threatens 25% tariffs on EU While European allies such as the UK and France are preparing to put peacekeeping troops on the ground to police the Ukraine-Russian borders, leaders have been clear that US support is essential to containing President Putin and securing that support is the key purpose of the prime minister's trip to Washington. President Zelenskyy has also demanded that clear guarantees of US military backing and security be part of his deal with the US on critical minerals, but a framework agreed this week by both sides did not include an explicit reference to any such support.  Ahead of the trip to Washington, the prime minister pledged to increase UK defence spending - a key ask of all NATO members by President Trump - and reiterated his commitment to putting British boots on the ground in Ukraine as he attempts to lower tensions between Europe and the US and demonstrate to President Trump that the UK is willing to play its part. \"When it comes to defence and security, we have for decades acted as a bridge because of the special relationship we have with the US and also our allegiance to our European allies,\" Sir Keir said. \"I've been absolutely resolute that we're not going to choose between one side of the Atlantic and the other. We will work with the US, we will work with our European allies, that's what we've done for decades, and it's what we'll do whilst I'm prime minister.\" ðŸ‘‰Listen to Politics At Jack And Sam's on your podcast appðŸ‘ˆ Sir Keir also gave the British public a \"message of reassurance\" after his decision to accelerate defence spending in the face of Russian aggression, saying he had done it to \"ensure their safety\" and increased investment would bring opportunities. \"I want to reassure the British public that what we're doing is to ensure their safety, their security and defence of our country. \"I want to also be clear that this is an opportunity because, as we increase defence spending, then that gives an opportunity for our industrial strategy, for jobs across the UK, good well-paid jobs in defence.\""

        "Content": "Hamas has handed the bodies of the last four Israeli hostages that were included in the first phase of the ceasefire deal to the Red Cross. The remains of the four men were exchanged for the release of more than 600 Palestinian prisoners. Hamas has previously identified the bodies as those of Tsachi Idan, Itzhak Elgarat, Ohad Yahalomi and Shlomo Mantzur - all four of whom were abducted from their kibbutz homes on 7 October 2023. DNA testing is being carried out by Israeli authorities to confirm their identities. A Red Cross convoy carrying dozens of released prisoners was also seen leaving Israel's Ofer prison in the West Bank before arriving in the Palestinian city of Ramallah. The group got off the bus to cheers from hundreds congregating outside. Some of the released menâ€”clad in green jackets and keffiyehsâ€”were hoisted aloft by the crowd. It was not immediately clear when the next detainees would be released. Meanwhile, the office of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu confirmed the country had received the four bodies. It said in a statement: \"The coffins were handed over to the IDF at the Kerem Shalom crossing through Egyptian mediation. An initial identification process has now begun on Israeli territory. \"The families of the abductees are being continuously updated on the situation and will be given an official notification at the end of the full identification process. \"The public is asked to respect the families' privacy and refrain from spreading rumours and information that is not official and well-founded. We will continue to update with reliable information in the future.\" The handover would complete both sides' obligations under the Gaza ceasefire's first phase, during which Hamas agreed to return 33 hostages, including eight bodies, in exchange for nearly 2,000 Palestinian prisoners. Hours before the four bodies were transferred on Wednesday, the family of Mr Idan said in a statement: \"Our family has received with great sadness Hamas's announcement that our beloved Tsachi is no longer alive and that his body will be returned to Israel during the night.\" It continued: \"Since Tsachi was kidnapped, we received several signs of life, and in the previous deal last November, Tsachi was alive and expected to be released. \"We appreciate the tremendous love and support we are receiving from the citizens of Israel, the media, and the Nahal Oz community.\" Egyptian mediators had earlier confirmed that they secured a breakthrough that would allow the handover of the final four hostage bodies due in the first phase of the deal after a days-long impasse. Hamas said an agreement had been reached for the exchange of hostages for prisoners, but said their release would be conducted under a new mechanism. It said the European Hospital in Khan Younis in southern Gaza was preparing to receive prisoners after their release. Israel had previously refused to release more than 600 Palestinian prisoners and detainees on Saturday after accusing Hamas of breaching the ceasefire deal by staging what it considered an offensive public handover of hostages in Gaza. The staged ceremonies in which living hostages and coffins containing hostage remains were displayed on stage before a crowd in Gaza drew strong criticism, including from the United Nations.  Days earlier, the ceasefire deal which came into effect on 19 January was held up briefly when Hamas handed over the remains of an unidentified woman instead of mother-of-two Shiri Bibas before delivering the correct body the next day. With the 42-day truce due to expire on Saturday, it also remains unclear whether an extension will be agreed or whether negotiations can begin on a second stage of the deal, which would see the release of the final 59 hostages left in Gaza. Read more:Trump shares bizarre AI video of Gaza visionBrother of former hostage says he was tortured Hamas said that, so far, it had not received any proposal for the second stage. Despite numerous hiccups, the ceasefire deal has so far held up. But moving to a second phase would require agreements on issues that have proved impossible to bridge in the past, including the post-war future of Gaza and Hamas, which Israel has vowed to eliminate as a governing force. Underlining the precariousness of the ceasefire, the Israeli military said a projectile was fired from Gaza but fell withinthe enclave. It said it was investigating the incident. The exchange comes on the same day as the funeral for Ms Bibas and her two sons - four-year-old Ariel, and nine-month-old Kfir - who came to symbolise the trauma felt by many Israelis after the 7 October attack."

        "Content": "\n          Science correspondent\n              @SkyNewsThomas\n A privately-built spacecraft has embarked on an unprecedented deep space mission to scout out an asteroid's potential for mining. The probe, called Odin, was launched on a SpaceX rocket alongside a robotic moon lander that will drill for water and a lunar orbiter that will map water resources with an instrument built by the University of Oxford. The asteroid mission is a high-risk venture that heralds a new dawn of commercial exploitation of our celestial neighbours. Odin is destined for asteroid 2022 OB5 that's believed to be rich in platinum and similar metals, which are critical for electronic, medical and green technology. Matt Gialich, engineer and co-founder of startup AstroForge, told Sky News that mining the metals on Earth costs $900 an ounce (Â£25,000 per kg). \"The problem is that on Earth we have mined all of the good sources of platinum group metals,\" he said. \"Everything we're looking at now is thousands of meters under the Earth. It's actually very, very difficult to mine. \n                  Space mission to blast off to moon's south pole - with suitcase-sized 'hopper' on board\n                 \n                  'No chance' of impact from asteroid 2024 YR4, say space agencies\n                 \n                  Planetary parade: How and when to spot seven planets in UK skies in rare alignment\n                 \"But we know this exists in space. We know it's readily available. For our mission, instead of going down, we want to go up.\" Odin will take 300 days to catch up with the asteroid one million miles from Earth. It will take close-up images of the surface to confirm it is metallic. The company then plans to land a second spacecraft on the asteroid later this year and test for platinum and other elements. If the asteroid is as rich in the metals as hoped the first mining expeditions could follow. AstroForge has developed a low-energy refining technique that it says can produce 1000kg of high-quality metal in three months. The precious cargo would then be returned to Earth. \"The cost of space has gotten so much cheaper than it's ever been,\" said Mr Gialich. \"The economics are starting to make a lot of sense. We can build and launch a really low-cost spacecraft to go take a stab at it.\" Scientists at the Natural History Museum in London have analysed the composition of meteorites that have fallen to Earth. Some have the weight and look of lumps of metal. Read more from Sky News:Space mission to blast off to moon's south pole'No chance' of impact from asteroid 2024 YR4 Professor Sara Russell, an expert in cosmic mineralogy at the museum, told Sky News: \"Metallic asteroids are rarer than stoney ones. \"But they make up quite a substantial part of our collection, so we know they are out there in space. \"We know they are incredibly rich in elements like platinum, cobalt and nickel. They are a fantastic resource for many metals.\" Mr Gialich said the time was right for rethinking the way humanity mines the resources that drive the economy. \"The way we mine today is one of the most damaging processes on Earth, right?!\" he said. \"We are destroying our planet to allow us to live in the way we live. Asteroid mining opens up a new gate to maintain our way of life, cost free.\""

        "Content": "Donald Trump has said he will impose 25% tariffs on the EU \"very soon\" and claimed the bloc was \"formed in order to screw the United States\". The US president made the remarks while holding his first cabinet meeting at the White House since his inauguration in January. The world's richest man Elon Musk, who leads the US Department of Government Efficiency but is not a cabinet member, was among those present. During his second term as president, Mr Trump has sparked fears of a global trade war by either imposing, or threatening to impose, high tariffs on both America's allies and geopolitical rivals. Earlier this month the US government imposed 25% tariffs on goods imported from Canada and Mexico and a 10% tariff on imports from China. Beijing retaliated by imposing 10% duties on many US imports and 15% tariffs on coal and liquefied natural gas. Meanwhile, the 25% tariffs on Mexico and Canada were paused after agreements were reached on border security. 'They've taken advantage of us' Asked whether he had made a decision about imposing tariffs on the European Union, Mr Trump said: \"We have made a decision, we'll be announcing it very soon and it will be 25% generally speaking and that will be on cars and all other things. \"The European Union is a different case than Canada, a different kind of case, they've really taken advantage of us in a different way. \"They don't accept our cars, they don't accept essentially our farm products. They use all sorts of reasons why not, and we accept everything from them, and we have about a $300bn (Â£237bn) deficit with the European Union.\" He added: \"The European Union, it was formed in order to screw the United States. \"Let's be honest - the European Union was formed in order to screw the United States, that's the purpose of it, and they've done a good job of it, but now I'm president.\"  Asked what he will do if the EU retaliates, Mr Trump said: \"They can't, I mean, they can try, but they can't.\" He added: \"They can retaliate, but it cannot be a successful retaliation, because we just go cold turkey, we don't buy anymore. \"If that happens, we win.\" A European Commission spokesperson said in response to Mr Trump's comments: \"The EU will react firmly and immediately against unjustified barriers to free and fair trade, including when tariffs are used to challenge legal and non-discriminatory policies. \"The European Union is the world's largest free market. And it has been a boon for the United States.\" The threat of tariffs comes at a time of fragile relations between the US and Europe as the Trump administration appears to favour Moscow over Kyiv as it tries to bring about peace in Ukraine. Mr Trump shocked European leaders last week by calling Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy a \"dictator with no elections\". Mr Zelenskyy accused the US president of living in a Russian-made \"disinformation space\".

The US president views the transaction with Ukraine as a fair way to recoup the billions of dollars that America has given Kyiv - via weapons and financial support - to help in their fight against Russia. ðŸ‘‰ Follow Trump 100 on your podcast app ðŸ‘ˆ Mr Trump went on to describe Russian President Vladimir Putin as a \"very smart\" and \"very cunning person\" during the cabinet meeting. He said: \"I think he wanted the whole (of Ukraine) when I got elected, (then) we spoke, and I think we're going to have a deal.\" Ukraine NATO membership ruled out Mr Trump also said he believes Mr Putin would never have invaded Ukraine if he was US president at the time. Asked whether Ukraine could gain NATO membership, the US president said: \"You can forget about it. That's probably the reason the whole thing started.\" Mr Trump declined to comment when asked about whether he would ever allow China to take control of Taiwan by force. \"I never comment on that,\" said. \"I don't want to ever put myself in that position.\" Mr Musk spoke briefly at the start of the meeting to explain why he believes the controversial cost-cutting measures his department has been carrying out have been necessary. Cabinet members were then asked by reporters if they were happy with Mr Musk and how he has been carrying out his role. Mr Musk started to answer the question, but Mr Trump interjected and said he might want to let cabinet members answer, before joking that if anyone disagreed, he might \"throw them out\"."

The British Dental Association (BDA) is warning patients may be forced to use \"Victorian-era\" methods. It says there are already cases of people pulling out their own teeth and others needing emergency surgery due to untreated infections. The government has pledged to deliver another 700,000 urgent appointments, with the roll out beginning in April. However, the BDA cites an NHS England letter to local health leaders which estimates 2.2 million people who need treatment currently cannot get an appointment. \"It is assumed that these are the people who would require urgent care appointments,\" the letter states.

Data shows as many as six in 10 children have rotting teeth by the age of five - with stark differences between poorer regions of England, and the more affluent. Local health bodies have been given targets to meet, but the BDA says the government needs to provide more funding so that no one is left out. \"It seems a new government discovered the need for urgent care, but chose just to cover a third of it. This is austerity on stilts,\" said Shiv Pabary, chair of the BDA's general dental practice committee. \"Rather than eliminating DIY dentistry, the Treasury is ensuring we keep seeing horrors that belong in the Victorian era.

The actress was found dead at her home in New York City after officers responded to a 911 call just after 8am local time this morning. An investigation into her death has been opened but \"criminality is not suspected\", police said. \"The family requests privacy for their loss,\" Trachtenberg's representative, Gary Mantoosh, said in a statement on Wednesday. Trachtenberg was best known for her role as Dawn Summers in Buffy, the younger sister of the title character played by Sarah Michelle Gellar between 2000 and 2003. Between 2008 and 2012, she played Georgina Sparks on Gossip Girl - the malevolent rival of Blake Lively's Serena van der Woodsen and Leighton Meester's Blair Waldorf. \"We are deeply saddened by the news of Michelle's passing. Michelle was so funny, kind, and talented,\" said a joint statement of \"Gossip Girl\" creators Josh Schwartz and Stephanie Savage. \"Her portrayal of Georgina Sparks was an iconic fan favourite, and grew from a one-season villain to a beloved character who returned over the course of six seasons. She was a delight to have on set and will be deeply missed. Our thoughts are with her family.\" She also starred in the movie 17 Again, where she portrayed daughter Maggie O'Donnell, comedy film Eurotrip and the 2005 teen film Ice Princess. Kim Cattrall, who played rink owner and figure skater Tina Harwood in Ice Princess, posted a picture of herself and Trachtenberg from that movie. Trachtenberg thanked Gellar for speaking out against Joss Whedon in 2021, following abuse allegations made against the Buffy showrunner. \"I am brave enough now as a 35-year-old woman to repost this,\" she wrote on social media, and alluded to \"his not appropriate behaviour\" she experienced as a teenage actor. In response to claims on the set of Buffy, Mr Whedon told Vulture that he was not as \"civilised\" as he was now and admitted yelling at the cast - but dismissed several other claims. Meanwhile, her co-star on Gossip Girl Ed Westwick said in an Instagram Story that he was \"so sad to hear of the passing of Michelle Trachtenberg sending prayers\". Buffy the Vampire Slayer co-star David Boreanaz said on Instagram it was \"so very sad.. horrible news\". Trachtenberg's first big break into Hollywood came in 1996, starring in the big screen adaptation of Harriet the Spy. In 2001, she received a Daytime Emmy nomination for hosting Discovery's Truth or Scare. Her most recent film appearance came last year when she played the role of Michelle Cody White in Spyral. Trachtenberg posted on social media in recent months to tell fans she was OK despite concerns that she appeared frail. She responded to one commenter: \"Did you lose a calendar and not realise I'm not 14. I'm 38.\""

        "Content": "\n          News reporter\n              @SunnyNadal\n  Donald Trump has shared a bizarre AI-generated video on his Truth Social platform showcasing what appears to be a vision of Gaza under his proposed plan. The footage, which the 78-year-old shared without comment, shows the war-ravaged territory before a caption appears: \"Gaza 2025... What's Next?\" It then goes on to show the area transformed into a Middle Eastern paradise with exotic beaches, Dubai-style skyscrapers, luxury yachts and people partying. It includes a \"Trump Gaza\" tower and a gigantic, golden statue of the US president - with miniature versions on sale in a souvenir gift shop. A child is also shown walking in a street, holding a huge, golden balloon of the president's head. The video also features the world leader dancing with a scantily clad belly dancer in a bar - and sunbathing and sipping cocktails by a hotel resort pool with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Elon Musk appears in the footage several times - sitting on a beach eating humous with flatbreads as bearded belly dancers perform on the sand. The billionaire boss of X, Tesla and SpaceX - who also leads the US Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) which has been tasked with cutting government spending - is also shown throwing dollar bills in the air for people. A song written for the video also plays in the background. The lyrics go: \"Donald's coming to set you free, bringing the light for all to see, no more tunnels, no more fear: Trump Gaza's finally here. \"Trump Gaza's shining bright, golden future, a brand new life. \"Feast and dance the deal is done, Trump Gaza number one.\" Sky News has established the video was first shared online in early February by accounts with no apparent connection to the White House. International correspondent Doing the job of a glossy brochure, this video is trying to sell a proposal Donald Trump sketched out several weeks ago. Gaza is \"a demolition site\" he said, that the US would \"take over\" and \"own\".\nÂ  Once it has been levelled, the US president will then construct \"the Riviera of the Mediterranean\". The enclave's 2.3 million residents would be resettled in Jordan or Egypt. \"We just clear out the whole thing,\" says Trump. The legal, ethical and practical challenges associated with this concept are too numerous to mention here - and it was noteworthy that members of his team, like secretary of state Marco Rubio, seemed to row back on the 'Riviera' after its launch. But Trump has not given up on his vision. In the absence of a genuine plan for Gaza's future governance â€“ and the current ceasefire deal has not produced anything that looks like a plan - the US president's invention looks like the only thing sitting on the table.Â  What about the naysayers then â€“ the lawyers, the human rights people and the Palestinians living on this \"demolition site\"? Well, the video is not going to change their minds. Ultimately, this 35-second spectacular is designed to please the president himself. In the virtual world, Trump has already fixed an issue that has bedevilled world leaders since the 1920s. All we have to do, is accept it. Read more from Sky News:Large bruise on Trump's hand prompts speculation over healthWhat you need to know about Trump's Gaza plan Mr Trump announced his plan - for when the war between Israel and Hamas ends - earlier this year. It includes relocating two million Gazans to neighbouring Arab countries and developing the territory into the \"Riviera of the Middle East\". He described Gaza as a \"demolition site\" where \"virtually every building is down\". Laying out his idea of what would happen beyond an Israel-Hamas ceasefire, he proposed: \"The US will take over the Gaza Strip and we will do a job with it too.\" He said America would be \"responsible for dismantling all of the dangerous unexploded bombs and other weapons on the site\", before it would \"get rid of the destroyed buildings\", and \"level it out\". \"Everybody I've spoken to loves the idea of the United States owning that piece of land, developing and creating thousands of jobs,\" he added. The White House described the proposal as \"out-of-the-box\" and \"visionary\" - but it was condemned as the effective \"ethnic cleansing\" of Palestinians from Gaza. Hamas described the proposals as \"ridiculous and absurd\" in a statement from one of its officials. Egypt, Jordan, and Saudi Arabia, which as fellow Arab nations support the Palestinian cause, also rejected Mr Trump's plan. Read more:Analysis: Trump's Gaza plan is so outrageous it might be something bigger Speaking to Sky News' US correspondent Mark Stone, Gaza resident Oday Basheer said in response to the video: \"It was disturbing to watch... it was disturbing from the moment that Trump announced that he was going to enter Gaza and take it and invest in it. \"Today, both sides (Hamas and Israel) are still fighting and we are not reaching any solution that satisfies everyone.\" Mr Basheer said that he fears Gaza will be destroyed and everyone who lives there will be forced to leave. He added: \"This is terrifying, we still don't [know] if we are going to stay here or not... we don't know what's happening tomorrow. \"This is terrifying and this is terrible.\" Meanwhile, there was a mixed reaction to the video in the comments section below it. One person wrote: \"I don't think that's funny or cool. Sorry. Am I missing something??? I hope it's a joke a bad joke..\" \"I hate this. I love our president, but this is horrible,\" said another. One Truth Social user wrote: \"Mr President while I appreciate what you do, is not about you. To God be the glory and the honor, for without Him, you couldn't have accomplished anything. The statue is a symbol of the antichrist, please humble yourself to God. Jesus is king and only Him.\" \"You're doing great Mr President. But don't let it get to your head. God put you in that position for His Glory, not yours,\" said another. \"Can we transform our US cities to look like this 2025 vision first? Our cities are dumps with ugly buildings and homeless people,\" wrote one user. \"Everything looks good, just stay away from these guys,\" said another, reposting a screenshot of the bearded belly dancers."

        "Content": "\n          Political reporter\n              @fayebrownSky\n A lack of jobs is forcing GPs out of the NHS with some taking up work as Uber drivers to pay the bills, experts have told Sky News. The \"ridiculous\" situation has been blamed on chronic underfunding and the rising costs of running a general practice - meaning there is not enough money to recruit. Politics Live: Would PM consider conscription? | Your questions answered It comes at a time when demand for GP appointments is greater than ever, with medics fearing the situation will get worse once the rise in employers' national insurance comes into effect in April, as GP surgeries are not exempt. According to a new survey by the British Medical Association (BMA), one in five GPs in England are already planning a career change because they can't find any or enough work. The poll of 1,400 family doctors tallies with the findings of a survey by Dr Steve Taylor of 1,000 GPs, which found one third are either underemployed or out of work. Dr Taylor, a Manchester-based GP of 30 years and a spokesperson for the Doctors Association, told Sky News he was aware of some newly qualified GPs working gig economy jobs like Uber drivers \"as a fill in just to pay the bills\". \n                  Sir Keir Starmer arrives in Washington for talks with President Trump - and repeats calls for security guarantee for Ukraine\n                 \n                  Politics latest: No deterrent for Putin without US, PM says ahead of Trump talks\n                 \n                  No 10 does not rule out defence spending increase could go to Chagos deal\n                 He said: \"In simple terms practices haven't had enough money to employ the new GPs that we are training, so there are doctors that are unemployed and a large proportion of GPs are under employed - so they are not working hours they'd want to work.\" He added that \"four years ago that wouldn't have been an issue\", with one applicant going for a salaried job at his practice back then - compared to 30 applicants competing for one job now. Dr Taylor called the situation a \"crisis\" and said his \"big worry\" is that \"will we end up with a two-tier system like dentistry\", with private providers sucking up out-of-work GPs. 'Ridiculous GPs can't find work'  The BMA's survey said 47% of respondents were expecting to make changes to their career - with the most popular option being to take clinical jobs outside the NHS (43%). Respondents also considered taking up GP opportunities abroad (40%) and leaving healthcare altogether (38%). Dr Mark Steggles, chair of the BMA's sessional GP committee, said: \"At a time of immense pressure on the NHS, and patients waiting too long to be seen, it's ridiculous that so many GPs can't find work. \"These findings confirm our worst fears. Not only is the issue spreading through the profession, but it's also leaving many wondering why they should bother staying in the NHS at all, further depriving patients of the vital care they need.\" What has the government done? The survey comes after a study by the Health Foundation found access to a GP is the public's top NHS concern - posing a potential headache for the government as it prioritises bringing down hospital waiting lists in its plan to fix the health service. The government said in December it would give GPs an extra Â£889m to slash red tape and spend more time with patients. Health Secretary Wes Streeting has sought to address the recruitment problem by expanding the Additional Roles Reimbursement Scheme (ARRS) - a Â£1.4bn funding pot introduced in 2019 to hire non-GP roles, such as dieticians and social prescribers, across Primary Care Networks (PCNS). PCNS are groups of GP practices, and last summer Mr Streeting announced Â£82m boost to the scheme so it could be expanded to GPs, in response to unemployment concerns. But experts said it is not a long-term solution as it only applies to 1,000 newly qualified GPs on fixed-term contracts - making the roles hard to fill. The job also requires working across as many as 15 practices within one PCN, often at lower salaries as the reimbursement rate is at the bottom end of the GP pay scale. The BMA said money for extra staff should go directly to GP practices and the amount should be increased, warning of a \"mass exodus\" if nothing is done. Mr Steggles said there is a \"real risk\" of a huge increase of unemployment rates in August, when 4,000 new GP trainees will qualify. The rise in employer NI could also exacerbate the situation, said Shropshire GP Jessica Harvey, who added practices are already being \"squeezed\" by the cost of living with no spare cash to recruit. \"It's an unprecedented crisis,\" she said. \"There's not enough GPs, we can't afford more doctors, practices are closing, patients are suffering from chronic underfunding and to have NI placed on top of that is causing an incredible amount of unnecessary stress.\" A Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said: \"This government inherited a ludicrous situation where patients can't get a GP, yet qualified GPs couldn't get a job. \"We acted immediately to cut red tape and have already proposed the biggest boost to GP funding in years - an extra Â£889m. \"We are committed to recruiting an extra 1,000 GPs as promised.\""

Speaking to reporters ahead of a crucial meeting at the White House, Sir Keir insisted that the UK was working \"in lockstep\" with the president on the matter of Ukraine. Asked if he could trust President Trump in light of what has happened in recent weeks, the prime minister replied \"yes\". \"I've got a good relationship with him,\" Sir Keir said. \"As you know, I've met him, I've spoken to him on the phone, and this relationship between our two countries is a special relationship with a long history, forged as we fought wars together, as we traded together. \"And as I say, I want it to go from strength to strength.\" Politics latest: PM's 'very stupid decision' condemned The prime minister has now arrived in Washington, but even before he touched down, the choreography of the trip hit a little turbulence as President Trump appeared to pour cold water on the prospect of a US military backstop for Ukraine as part of any peace deal - a key UK and European demand.  \"I'm not going to make security guarantees beyond very much,\" Mr Trump said at his first cabinet meeting on Wednesday. \"We're going to have Europe do that because Europe is the next-door neighbour.\" His remarks seemed at odds with those made by the prime minister on the way to Washington as he reiterated how important a US military backstop was for Ukraine. \"We all want a peaceful outcome,\" the prime minister said. \"It's got to be a lasting peace, and that requires us to put in place an effective security guarantee. \"Exactly what the configuration of that is, exactly what the backstop is, is obviously the subject of intense discussion.\" He added: \"But the reason I say the backstop is so important is that the security guarantee has to be sufficient to deter Putin from coming again because my concern is if there is a ceasefire without a backstop, it will simply give him the opportunity to wait and to come again because his ambition in relation to Ukraine is pretty obvious, I think, for all to see.\" Read more:CIA asked to look at UK 'order'Trump threatens 25% tariffs on EU While European allies such as the UK and France are preparing to put peacekeeping troops on the ground to police the Ukraine-Russian borders, leaders have been clear that US support is essential to containing President Putin and securing that support is the key purpose of the prime minister's trip to Washington. President Zelenskyy has also demanded that clear guarantees of US military backing and security be part of his deal with the US on critical minerals, but a framework agreed this week by both sides did not include an explicit reference to any such support.  Ahead of the trip to Washington, the prime minister pledged to increase UK defence spending - a key ask of all NATO members by President Trump - and reiterated his commitment to putting British boots on the ground in Ukraine as he attempts to lower tensions between Europe and the US and demonstrate to President Trump that the UK is willing to play its part. \"When it comes to defence and security, we have for decades acted as a bridge because of the special relationship we have with the US and also our allegiance to our European allies,\" Sir Keir said. \"I've been absolutely resolute that we're not going to choose between one side of the Atlantic and the other. We will work with the US, we will work with our European allies, that's what we've done for decades, and it's what we'll do whilst I'm prime minister.\" ðŸ‘‰Listen to Politics At Jack And Sam's on your podcast appðŸ‘ˆ Sir Keir also gave the British public a \"message of reassurance\" after his decision to accelerate defence spending in the face of Russian aggression, saying he had done it to \"ensure their safety\" and increased investment would bring opportunities. \"I want to reassure the British public that what we're doing is to ensure their safety, their security and defence of our country. \"I want to also be clear that this is an opportunity because, as we increase defence spending, then that gives an opportunity for our industrial strategy, for jobs across the UK, good well-paid jobs in defence.\""

The defendants and Mr Siafa crossed paths at the junction of Surrey Street and Fellmongers Yard shortly before 6pm on 12 April last year, as stallholders at the nearby Surrey Street fruit and vegetable market were packing up for the day. CCTV showed that Mr Siafa turned back and ran into the yard, as the defendants reached into the waistband of their trousers and chased him, jurors heard. About 20 seconds later, they emerged from the yard and Mr Siafa had been fatally stabbed.

        "Content": "\n          Political reporter\n       The CIA, NSA and multiple other US intelligence agencies have been asked to examine a reported request from the UK government for Apple to implement a backdoor in their encryption.  Tulsi Gabbard, the US director of national intelligence (DNI), announced the measures in a letter to two US politicians who had raised concerns about the move. Apple last week withdrew some of its secure storage features from the UK. It was reported previously that the UK government had asked the US tech giant to give it access to users' protected data worldwide. Both the current Labour government, the previous Tory administrations and campaigners say they want less rigorous encryption to protect children and prevent crime.

The UK government is said to have made the demand to Apple under the Investigatory Powers Act 2016, which is also known as the \"Snooper's Charter\". The government does not disclose whether it has made orders under the act, and has not commented on the specifics with Apple. Apple is also prevented from commenting on whether an order was made.

She added: \"This would be a clear and egregious violation of Americans' privacy and civil liberties, and open up a serious vulnerability for cyber exploitation by adversarial actors.\" Ms Gabbard - who is close to Mr Trump - said she was not made aware of the order by the UK. She said she has requested the CIA (Central Intelligence Agency), DIA (Defense Intelligence Agency), DHS (Department of Homeland Security), FBI (Federal Bureau of Investigation) and NSA (National Security Agency) all to provide her with \"insights\" about what is in the public domain. US government lawyers have also been asked to give a legal opinion on the implications of the reported order on the bilateral Cloud Act agreement. The DNI highlighted that the agreement prevents either state from issuing demands for the data of citizens or nationals of the other. Ms Gabbard's letter was in response to a letter from Democrat senator Ron Wyden and Republican representative Andy Biggs, sent almost two weeks ago. This is before Apple pulled its Advanced Data Protection from the UK, but after reports of the request to the iPhone and Mac makers. ðŸ‘‰Listen to Politics At Jack And Sam's on your podcast appðŸ‘ˆ The two politicians said: \"These reported actions seriously threaten the privacy and security of both the American people and the US government.\" They urged Ms Gabbard to \"reevaluate US-UK cybersecurity arrangements and programmes as well as US intelligence sharing with the UK\" if the UK did not change tack.

        "Content": "The Metropolitan Police has unveiled a new charter for stop and search, including more oversight of how the \"contentious\" tactic is used and improved handling of complaints. The force said it had been developed with the help of more than 8,500 Londoners of all ages and ethnicities. Stop and search allows officers to detain a person who's not under arrest if they have reasonable grounds to think an \"unlawful item\", such as a weapon or drugs, is being carried. It's controversial as people from ethnic minorities, especially young black men, say they are targeted disproportionately. Stop and search has been described by some as a \"rite of passage\" for black boys - one that can leave them feeling embarrassed and humiliated. Campaigners cite it as a key reason why some people have low trust in the police. However, the Met said the tactic is successful and had saved lives by leading to the seizure of 17,500 weapons in the last four years, including at least 3,500 in 2024. \n                  Metropolitan Police faces 'eye-watering' cuts to spending, boss warns\n                 \n                  Sir Mark Rowley: UK's top cop says two police officers 'seriously injured' weekly, amid falling trust and rising criticism\n                 \n                  Met Police chief says 'fears of extreme-right disorder abated' after 'show of unity from communities'\n                 Up to 68% of Londoners, including young people, are said to support its use. But the force admits support varies according to who's asked and that many black Londoners say it creates tensions with the police. Met chief Sir Mark Rowley said it can \"burn through trust\" when done badly, but that many officers already used it respectfully and with empathy. The commissioner said he hoped the new charter would \"help to build trust in a policing tactic that, so often, has been at the root of mistrust\". It's been introduced following the recommendation of Baroness Casey in her damning 2023 review of the Met. Events were held across London to get views on what it should include, with themes that emerged tested in surveys of 8,500 people. The Met said the charter would help ensure searches are done professionally and respectfully. It includes: â€¢ Improved training so police better understand communities they serve. Communication skills will also be developed to ensure officers show empathy and are confident in de-escalation during searches.â€¢ A \"more robust supervision process\" with regular and random reviews of how stop and search is operating.â€¢ Better handling of complaints, making the process more accessible and involving the community with decision making to prevent internal bias.â€¢ A pledge to work with communities to \"reduce fear and show that [stop and search] is being used fairly and without prejudice\". Read more:Officers sacked over athlete stop and search get jobs back Sir Mark added: \"If we are to take the fight to those intent on causing serious violence, fear and intimidation across London then stop and search must form part of that effort. \"If we allow its contentious nature and the concerns associated with it to force us into doing less of it, then only the criminals win. \"This charter is particularly powerful because it has been written with communities. \"We're immensely grateful to all who stepped forward to work with us. We are committed to this change and to further rebuilding trust by continuing the conversations that have made it possible so far.\""

Following the deaths of 72 people in the 2017 Grenfell Tower fire, Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner has given the government's response to the inquiry, published in September after seven years. The government has accepted the findings of the report, which found \"systematic dishonesty\" contributed to the devastating fire and there were years of missed opportunities to prevent the catastrophe. Politics latest: Starmer addresses boosting defence spending Seven organisations criticised in the report will now be investigated under the Procurement Act, Ms Rayner said. If they are determined to have \"engaged in professional misconduct\" their names will be added to a \"debarment list\", which all contracting authorities will have to take into account when awarding new contracts. Arconic, Saint-Gobain (the former owner of Celotex), Exova, Harley Facades, Kingspan Insulation, Rydon Maintenance and Studio E Architects will all be investigated. \n                  Grenfell Tower â€“ what happens now?\n                 \n                  Grenfell Tower fire: Survivor calls on Angela Rayner to reconsider demolition decision\n                 \n                  Grenfell Tower will be demolished, government confirms\n                 Cabinet Office parliamentary secretary Georgia Gould said the organisations will be notified when an investigation is opened, and warned investigations into other organisations could take place. London Mayor Sadiq Khan said companies named and shamed in the report \"should be barred from future contracts\" and \"this must now finally happen without further delay\". Ms Rayner, who is also the housing secretary, said the government \"accepts the findings\" of the inquiry and it will \"prioritise residents and protect their interests, and make sure that industry builds safe homes, and provide clearer accountability and enforcement\". She apologised again to the families and friends of those who died, survivors and those who live around the tower. \"To have anyone anywhere living in an unsafe home is one person too many,\" she told the House of Commons. \"That will be our guiding principle and must be that of anyone who wants to build or care for our homes. That will be an important part of the legacy of Grenfell.\"  More training for social housing tenants She announced \"stronger protections\" for social housing tenants, giving them more power to challenge landlords and demand safe, high-quality housing. The \"Four Million Homes\" training will be expanded - a government-funded initiative that provides guidance and training for social housing tenants. News correspondent For Grenfell survivors, time has become an ever-growing source of pain. In the days after the fire, none of them could have imagined nearly eight years later there would still be no arrests. They waited seven years for a public inquiry to complete its work, and today they heard it could take another three to four years for its recommendations to take effect - with no guarantees those will even be implemented â€˜\"in full\". Edward Daffarn, a survivor and campaigner with Grenfell United, said it is like being on a \"carousel of delay\". \n\"Even if the government's intentions are the right ones,\" he said. He finds the fact that nine of Sir Martin Moore-Bick's 58 recommendations have been accepted only \"in principle\" deeply concerning. One of those is the establishment of a single regulator for the construction industry.  The government plans to create this, but will stop short of allowing it to take back public control of testing and certification of construction products, or to issue compliance certificates. Mr Daffarn called that simply \"baffling\".Â If all recommendations are properly implemented, he said, meaningful change is possible. But he fears they have years of campaigning still to go before that day comes.Â  However, the National Housing Federation (NHF), which represents about 800 housing associations, said it missed the point as it said social housing tenants cannot access government funding to remove dangerous cladding - and manufacturers of unsafe materials have not contributed to the costs. Kate Henderson, chief executive of the NHF, told Sky News: \"The money to fund this work is coming from people on the lowest incomes in this country, and to make matters worse, means fewer homes will be built for those in dire situations on housing waiting lists, living in overcrowded homes and stuck in temporary accommodation. \"The government must put an end to this unfair funding regime and give social housing providers and their residents equal access to building safety funding.\" Ms Rayner also announced: â€¢ A new single construction regulator so those responsible for building safety are held to account â€¢ Tougher oversight of testing and certifying, manufacturing and using construction products - with \"serious consequences\" for those who break the rules â€¢ A legal duty of candour through a \"new Hillsborough Law\", so public authorities must disclose the truth â€¢ Stronger, clearer and enforceable legal rights for residents so landlords are responsible for acting on safety concerns â€¢ A publicly accessible record of all public inquiry recommendations Polly Neate, chief executive of housing and homelessness charity Shelter, said it is \"right\" the government has committed to take forward all the inquiry's recommendations but said it needs to boost funding for legal aid so people can actually enforce their rights as tenants. Earlier this month, the government announced the tower, which has stood covered in scaffolding since the fire nearly eight years ago, will be \"carefully\" demolished in a process likely to take two years."

The British Dental Association (BDA) is warning patients may be forced to use \"Victorian-era\" methods. It says there are already cases of people pulling out their own teeth and others needing emergency surgery due to untreated infections. The government has pledged to deliver another 700,000 urgent appointments, with the roll out beginning in April. However, the BDA cites an NHS England letter to local health leaders which estimates 2.2 million people who need treatment currently cannot get an appointment. \"It is assumed that these are the people who would require urgent care appointments,\" the letter states.

Local health bodies have been given targets to meet, but the BDA says the government needs to provide more funding so that no one is left out. \"It seems a new government discovered the need for urgent care, but chose just to cover a third of it. This is austerity on stilts,\" said Shiv Pabary, chair of the BDA's general dental practice committee. \"Rather than eliminating DIY dentistry, the Treasury is ensuring we keep seeing horrors that belong in the Victorian era.

        "Content": "Hamas has handed the bodies of the last four Israeli hostages that were included in the first phase of the ceasefire deal to the Red Cross. The remains of the four men were exchanged for the release of more than 600 Palestinian prisoners. Hamas has previously identified the bodies as those of Tsachi Idan, Itzhak Elgarat, Ohad Yahalomi and Shlomo Mantzur - all four of whom were abducted from their kibbutz homes on 7 October 2023. DNA testing is being carried out by Israeli authorities to confirm their identities. A Red Cross convoy carrying dozens of released prisoners was also seen leaving Israel's Ofer prison in the West Bank before arriving in the Palestinian city of Ramallah. The group got off the bus to cheers from hundreds congregating outside. Some of the released menâ€”clad in green jackets and keffiyehsâ€”were hoisted aloft by the crowd. It was not immediately clear when the next detainees would be released. Meanwhile, the office of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu confirmed the country had received the four bodies. It said in a statement: \"The coffins were handed over to the IDF at the Kerem Shalom crossing through Egyptian mediation. An initial identification process has now begun on Israeli territory. \"The families of the abductees are being continuously updated on the situation and will be given an official notification at the end of the full identification process. \"The public is asked to respect the families' privacy and refrain from spreading rumours and information that is not official and well-founded. We will continue to update with reliable information in the future.\" The handover would complete both sides' obligations under the Gaza ceasefire's first phase, during which Hamas agreed to return 33 hostages, including eight bodies, in exchange for nearly 2,000 Palestinian prisoners. Hours before the four bodies were transferred on Wednesday, the family of Mr Idan said in a statement: \"Our family has received with great sadness Hamas's announcement that our beloved Tsachi is no longer alive and that his body will be returned to Israel during the night.\" It continued: \"Since Tsachi was kidnapped, we received several signs of life, and in the previous deal last November, Tsachi was alive and expected to be released. \"We appreciate the tremendous love and support we are receiving from the citizens of Israel, the media, and the Nahal Oz community.\" Egyptian mediators had earlier confirmed that they secured a breakthrough that would allow the handover of the final four hostage bodies due in the first phase of the deal after a days-long impasse. Hamas said an agreement had been reached for the exchange of hostages for prisoners, but said their release would be conducted under a new mechanism. It said the European Hospital in Khan Younis in southern Gaza was preparing to receive prisoners after their release. Israel had previously refused to release more than 600 Palestinian prisoners and detainees on Saturday after accusing Hamas of breaching the ceasefire deal by staging what it considered an offensive public handover of hostages in Gaza. The staged ceremonies in which living hostages and coffins containing hostage remains were displayed on stage before a crowd in Gaza drew strong criticism, including from the United Nations.  Days earlier, the ceasefire deal which came into effect on 19 January was held up briefly when Hamas handed over the remains of an unidentified woman instead of mother-of-two Shiri Bibas before delivering the correct body the next day. With the 42-day truce due to expire on Saturday, it also remains unclear whether an extension will be agreed or whether negotiations can begin on a second stage of the deal, which would see the release of the final 59 hostages left in Gaza.

Despite numerous hiccups, the ceasefire deal has so far held up. But moving to a second phase would require agreements on issues that have proved impossible to bridge in the past, including the post-war future of Gaza and Hamas, which Israel has vowed to eliminate as a governing force. Underlining the precariousness of the ceasefire, the Israeli military said a projectile was fired from Gaza but fell withinthe enclave. It said it was investigating the incident. The exchange comes on the same day as the funeral for Ms Bibas and her two sons - four-year-old Ariel, and nine-month-old Kfir - who came to symbolise the trauma felt by many Israelis after the 7 October attack."

        "Content": "\n          Science correspondent\n              @SkyNewsThomas\n A privately-built spacecraft has embarked on an unprecedented deep space mission to scout out an asteroid's potential for mining. The probe, called Odin, was launched on a SpaceX rocket alongside a robotic moon lander that will drill for water and a lunar orbiter that will map water resources with an instrument built by the University of Oxford. The asteroid mission is a high-risk venture that heralds a new dawn of commercial exploitation of our celestial neighbours. Odin is destined for asteroid 2022 OB5 that's believed to be rich in platinum and similar metals, which are critical for electronic, medical and green technology. Matt Gialich, engineer and co-founder of startup AstroForge, told Sky News that mining the metals on Earth costs $900 an ounce (Â£25,000 per kg). \"The problem is that on Earth we have mined all of the good sources of platinum group metals,\" he said. \"Everything we're looking at now is thousands of meters under the Earth. It's actually very, very difficult to mine. \n                  Space mission to blast off to moon's south pole - with suitcase-sized 'hopper' on board\n                 \n                  'No chance' of impact from asteroid 2024 YR4, say space agencies\n                 \n                  Planetary parade: How and when to spot seven planets in UK skies in rare alignment\n                 \"But we know this exists in space. We know it's readily available. For our mission, instead of going down, we want to go up.\" Odin will take 300 days to catch up with the asteroid one million miles from Earth. It will take close-up images of the surface to confirm it is metallic. The company then plans to land a second spacecraft on the asteroid later this year and test for platinum and other elements. If the asteroid is as rich in the metals as hoped the first mining expeditions could follow. AstroForge has developed a low-energy refining technique that it says can produce 1000kg of high-quality metal in three months. The precious cargo would then be returned to Earth. \"The cost of space has gotten so much cheaper than it's ever been,\" said Mr Gialich. \"The economics are starting to make a lot of sense. We can build and launch a really low-cost spacecraft to go take a stab at it.\" Scientists at the Natural History Museum in London have analysed the composition of meteorites that have fallen to Earth. Some have the weight and look of lumps of metal. Read more from Sky News:Space mission to blast off to moon's south pole'No chance' of impact from asteroid 2024 YR4 Professor Sara Russell, an expert in cosmic mineralogy at the museum, told Sky News: \"Metallic asteroids are rarer than stoney ones. \"But they make up quite a substantial part of our collection, so we know they are out there in space. \"We know they are incredibly rich in elements like platinum, cobalt and nickel. They are a fantastic resource for many metals.\" Mr Gialich said the time was right for rethinking the way humanity mines the resources that drive the economy. \"The way we mine today is one of the most damaging processes on Earth, right?!\" he said. \"We are destroying our planet to allow us to live in the way we live. Asteroid mining opens up a new gate to maintain our way of life, cost free.\""

        "Content": "Donald Trump has said he will impose 25% tariffs on the EU \"very soon\" and claimed the bloc was \"formed in order to screw the United States\". The US president made the remarks while holding his first cabinet meeting at the White House since his inauguration in January. The world's richest man Elon Musk, who leads the US Department of Government Efficiency but is not a cabinet member, was among those present. During his second term as president, Mr Trump has sparked fears of a global trade war by either imposing, or threatening to impose, high tariffs on both America's allies and geopolitical rivals. Earlier this month the US government imposed 25% tariffs on goods imported from Canada and Mexico and a 10% tariff on imports from China. Beijing retaliated by imposing 10% duties on many US imports and 15% tariffs on coal and liquefied natural gas. Meanwhile, the 25% tariffs on Mexico and Canada were paused after agreements were reached on border security. 'They've taken advantage of us' Asked whether he had made a decision about imposing tariffs on the European Union, Mr Trump said: \"We have made a decision, we'll be announcing it very soon and it will be 25% generally speaking and that will be on cars and all other things. \"The European Union is a different case than Canada, a different kind of case, they've really taken advantage of us in a different way. \"They don't accept our cars, they don't accept essentially our farm products. They use all sorts of reasons why not, and we accept everything from them, and we have about a $300bn (Â£237bn) deficit with the European Union.\" He added: \"The European Union, it was formed in order to screw the United States. \"Let's be honest - the European Union was formed in order to screw the United States, that's the purpose of it, and they've done a good job of it, but now I'm president.\"  Asked what he will do if the EU retaliates, Mr Trump said: \"They can't, I mean, they can try, but they can't.\" He added: \"They can retaliate, but it cannot be a successful retaliation, because we just go cold turkey, we don't buy anymore. \"If that happens, we win.\" A European Commission spokesperson said in response to Mr Trump's comments: \"The EU will react firmly and immediately against unjustified barriers to free and fair trade, including when tariffs are used to challenge legal and non-discriminatory policies. \"The European Union is the world's largest free market. And it has been a boon for the United States.\" The threat of tariffs comes at a time of fragile relations between the US and Europe as the Trump administration appears to favour Moscow over Kyiv as it tries to bring about peace in Ukraine. Mr Trump shocked European leaders last week by calling Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy a \"dictator with no elections\". Mr Zelenskyy accused the US president of living in a Russian-made \"disinformation space\".

The US president views the transaction with Ukraine as a fair way to recoup the billions of dollars that America has given Kyiv - via weapons and financial support - to help in their fight against Russia. ðŸ‘‰ Follow Trump 100 on your podcast app ðŸ‘ˆ Mr Trump went on to describe Russian President Vladimir Putin as a \"very smart\" and \"very cunning person\" during the cabinet meeting. He said: \"I think he wanted the whole (of Ukraine) when I got elected, (then) we spoke, and I think we're going to have a deal.\" Ukraine NATO membership ruled out Mr Trump also said he believes Mr Putin would never have invaded Ukraine if he was US president at the time. Asked whether Ukraine could gain NATO membership, the US president said: \"You can forget about it. That's probably the reason the whole thing started.\" Mr Trump declined to comment when asked about whether he would ever allow China to take control of Taiwan by force. \"I never comment on that,\" said. \"I don't want to ever put myself in that position.\" Mr Musk spoke briefly at the start of the meeting to explain why he believes the controversial cost-cutting measures his department has been carrying out have been necessary. Cabinet members were then asked by reporters if they were happy with Mr Musk and how he has been carrying out his role. Mr Musk started to answer the question, but Mr Trump interjected and said he might want to let cabinet members answer, before joking that if anyone disagreed, he might \"throw them out\"."

        "Content": "\n          News reporter\n              @SunnyNadal\n  Donald Trump has shared a bizarre AI-generated video on his Truth Social platform showcasing what appears to be a vision of Gaza under his proposed plan. The footage, which the 78-year-old shared without comment, shows the war-ravaged territory before a caption appears: \"Gaza 2025... What's Next?\" It then goes on to show the area transformed into a Middle Eastern paradise with exotic beaches, Dubai-style skyscrapers, luxury yachts and people partying. It includes a \"Trump Gaza\" tower and a gigantic, golden statue of the US president - with miniature versions on sale in a souvenir gift shop. A child is also shown walking in a street, holding a huge, golden balloon of the president's head. The video also features the world leader dancing with a scantily clad belly dancer in a bar - and sunbathing and sipping cocktails by a hotel resort pool with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Elon Musk appears in the footage several times - sitting on a beach eating humous with flatbreads as bearded belly dancers perform on the sand. The billionaire boss of X, Tesla and SpaceX - who also leads the US Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) which has been tasked with cutting government spending - is also shown throwing dollar bills in the air for people. A song written for the video also plays in the background. The lyrics go: \"Donald's coming to set you free, bringing the light for all to see, no more tunnels, no more fear: Trump Gaza's finally here. \"Trump Gaza's shining bright, golden future, a brand new life. \"Feast and dance the deal is done, Trump Gaza number one.\" Sky News has established the video was first shared online in early February by accounts with no apparent connection to the White House. International correspondent Doing the job of a glossy brochure, this video is trying to sell a proposal Donald Trump sketched out several weeks ago. Gaza is \"a demolition site\" he said, that the US would \"take over\" and \"own\".\nÂ  Once it has been levelled, the US president will then construct \"the Riviera of the Mediterranean\". The enclave's 2.3 million residents would be resettled in Jordan or Egypt. \"We just clear out the whole thing,\" says Trump. The legal, ethical and practical challenges associated with this concept are too numerous to mention here - and it was noteworthy that members of his team, like secretary of state Marco Rubio, seemed to row back on the 'Riviera' after its launch. But Trump has not given up on his vision. In the absence of a genuine plan for Gaza's future governance â€“ and the current ceasefire deal has not produced anything that looks like a plan - the US president's invention looks like the only thing sitting on the table.Â  What about the naysayers then â€“ the lawyers, the human rights people and the Palestinians living on this \"demolition site\"? Well, the video is not going to change their minds. Ultimately, this 35-second spectacular is designed to please the president himself. In the virtual world, Trump has already fixed an issue that has bedevilled world leaders since the 1920s. All we have to do, is accept it. Read more from Sky News:Large bruise on Trump's hand prompts speculation over healthWhat you need to know about Trump's Gaza plan Mr Trump announced his plan - for when the war between Israel and Hamas ends - earlier this year. It includes relocating two million Gazans to neighbouring Arab countries and developing the territory into the \"Riviera of the Middle East\". He described Gaza as a \"demolition site\" where \"virtually every building is down\". Laying out his idea of what would happen beyond an Israel-Hamas ceasefire, he proposed: \"The US will take over the Gaza Strip and we will do a job with it too.\" He said America would be \"responsible for dismantling all of the dangerous unexploded bombs and other weapons on the site\", before it would \"get rid of the destroyed buildings\", and \"level it out\". \"Everybody I've spoken to loves the idea of the United States owning that piece of land, developing and creating thousands of jobs,\" he added. The White House described the proposal as \"out-of-the-box\" and \"visionary\" - but it was condemned as the effective \"ethnic cleansing\" of Palestinians from Gaza. Hamas described the proposals as \"ridiculous and absurd\" in a statement from one of its officials. Egypt, Jordan, and Saudi Arabia, which as fellow Arab nations support the Palestinian cause, also rejected Mr Trump's plan. Read more:Analysis: Trump's Gaza plan is so outrageous it might be something bigger Speaking to Sky News' US correspondent Mark Stone, Gaza resident Oday Basheer said in response to the video: \"It was disturbing to watch... it was disturbing from the moment that Trump announced that he was going to enter Gaza and take it and invest in it. \"Today, both sides (Hamas and Israel) are still fighting and we are not reaching any solution that satisfies everyone.\" Mr Basheer said that he fears Gaza will be destroyed and everyone who lives there will be forced to leave. He added: \"This is terrifying, we still don't [know] if we are going to stay here or not... we don't know what's happening tomorrow. \"This is terrifying and this is terrible.\" Meanwhile, there was a mixed reaction to the video in the comments section below it. One person wrote: \"I don't think that's funny or cool. Sorry. Am I missing something??? I hope it's a joke a bad joke..\" \"I hate this. I love our president, but this is horrible,\" said another. One Truth Social user wrote: \"Mr President while I appreciate what you do, is not about you. To God be the glory and the honor, for without Him, you couldn't have accomplished anything. The statue is a symbol of the antichrist, please humble yourself to God. Jesus is king and only Him.\" \"You're doing great Mr President. But don't let it get to your head. God put you in that position for His Glory, not yours,\" said another. \"Can we transform our US cities to look like this 2025 vision first? Our cities are dumps with ugly buildings and homeless people,\" wrote one user. \"Everything looks good, just stay away from these guys,\" said another, reposting a screenshot of the bearded belly dancers."

In its latest update on the 88-year-old pontiff, the Vatican said a mild kidney insufficiency that had developed days ago has now receded. It stressed, however, that, \"although there is a slight improvement, the prognosis remains reserved\". The Pope has been at Rome's Gemelli Hospital since 14 February and is being treated for double pneumonia and chronic bronchitis. A CT chest scan taken on Tuesday evening showed the \"normal evolution\" of pneumonia as it is being treated. Blood tests have confirmed an improvement. Francis returned to work in the afternoon after receiving the Eurcharist in the morning, the Vatican added. The Pope is still eating normally and talking with doctors and aides, Vatican sources said. On Tuesday, he met Cardinal Pietro Parolin and Archbishop Edgar Pena Parra, the so-called Vatican \"substitute\" or chief of staff. Over the weekend, the pontiff suffered a \"prolonged respiratory crisis\" that required a high flow of oxygen. The Vatican said in its latest bulletin the Pope was continuing the high-flow oxygen therapy - but added that \"today too he has not presented asthmatic respiratory crises\". Doctors have previously said the condition of the Argentine pontiff, who had part of one lung removed as a young man, is touch-and-go, given his age, fragility, and pre-existing lung disease before the pneumonia set in. Francis has previously said he has written a letter of resignation, in case he becomes medically incapacitated. Thousands of people have gathered in St Peter's Square for the past few evenings to pray for the Pope's recovery. Others have descended on the Gemelli hospital to be closer to Pope Francis. They have been lighting candles and leaving him cards and gifts at the statue of St John Paul II near the entrance."

        "Content": "The second Fyre Festival has officially been announced, nearly 10 years since the first infamous event quickly turned into a disaster. The failed festival in 2017 hit headlines after charging guests up to $100,000 per head to travel to the island of Great Exuma in the Bahamas, but failing to deliver the white sands, luxury accommodation and first-class food that was promised. It even led to co-organiser Billy McFarland serving nearly four years of a six-year prison sentence after he pleaded guilty to wire fraud charges relating to the festival and various fraud charges stemming from a separate ticket-selling scam. Read more: Fyre Festival: What happened in 2017 Plans for Fyre II have been on and off since 2023, but this is the furthest it has ever come, with the event set for 30 May to 2 June and 2,000 tickets officially having gone on sale earlier this week. Relaunching the festival, Mr McFarland told Sky News' US partner NBC News that Fyre II is \"not about the past\" but about \"taking the vision, which is strong\". Unlike the original festival, Fyre said in a statement that live event organiser Lostnights has signed up to handle the details, along with hotel, travel and ticketing companies also coming on board to help plan and organise the event. One thing that has not changed is ticket costs, with prices ranging from $1,400 (Â£1,100) to an eye watering $1.1m (Â£869,000). The website states that the top-tier ticket - named the Prometheus package - gets eight people into the festival as well as the option to stay on a yacht, have a 24/7 private chauffeur, access to one of the stages as well as exclusive \"additional experiences\". \"You will be on a boat, have the luxury yachts that we partner with who will be docked and parked outside the island,\" Mr McFarland told NBC's Today show. \"But once again, Fyre is not just about this, like, luxury experience,\" he added. \"It's about the adventure. So you'll be scuba diving with me. You'll be bouncing around to other islands and other countries on small planes.\" Mr McFarland has also promised performances from a number of artists across the electronic, hip hop, pop and rock genres. But no artists are yet to be announced to be taking part. \"It's not just music. We might have a professional skateboarder do a demonstration. We might have an MMA champion teach you techniques in the morning,\" he said. 'There is a risk component to it' The disaster of the first Fyre festival became the focus of the Netflix series FYRE: The Greatest Party That Never Happened in 2019. It portrayed stranded guests who were faced to battle for a limited number of tents, had issues with access to water, and instead of gourmet meals, were served limp cheese sandwiches in Styrofoam boxes, a photo of which went viral on social media at the time. When asked if there was a risk to buying a ticket to the second attempt at the festival, Mr McFarland told Today: \"Until it's experienced, there is a risk component to it.\" \"You're taking a risk because I made a lot of bad decisions and messed up the first festival,\" he said. \"Since 2016, Fyre has been the most talked about music festival in the world. Obviously, a lot of that has been negative, but I think that most people, once they kind of get under the hood and study the plans and see the team behind Fyre II, they see the upside.\" Read more from Sky News:Going For Gold presenter Henry Kelly diesBiggest crypto heist in history He said if the festival is a success, he thinks it has the chance to be an annual event. A minimum of $500,000 (Â£395,000) from the festival will also go toward the $26m (Â£20m) in losses that Mr McFarland still owes, NBC reported."

        "Content": " A former Israeli hostage has paid tribute to his wife and two young children who were killed in captivity in Gaza, saying: \"I hope you know I thought about you every day, every minute.\" Thousands of mourners in Israel gathered on the streets for the funeral procession of Shiri Bibas and her two sons. Ms Bibas, 32, was kidnapped with four-year-old Ariel, and nine-month-old Kfir from the Niz Or kibbutz during Hamas's attack on Israel in October 2023.   The children's father, Yarden Bibas, who was taken hostage separately from his family, was freed on 1 February. His wife and children were buried near Niz Or kibbutz during a private ceremony on Wednesday. Mr Bibas delivered an emotional eulogy at the funeral. \"Do you remember our last decision together? In the safe room, I asked if we should fight or surrender. You said fight, so I fought,\" he said, speaking directly to his wife. \"Shiri, I'm sorry I couldn't protect you all. If only I had known what would happen, I wouldn't have fought.\" He then spoke of his elder son, Ariel: \"I'm sure you're making all the angels laugh with your silly jokes and impressions. I hope there are plenty of butterflies for you to watch, just like you did during our picnics.\" Mr Bibas also addressed his youngest son. \"Kfir, I'm sorry I didn't protect you better,\" he said. \"I miss nibbling on you and hearing your laughter.\" People holding up Israeli flags and orange balloons lined the streets to pay their final respects. The extended Bibas family has been active at protests, branding the colour orange as the symbol of their fight for the \"ginger babies\". In the city of Tel Aviv, people gathered to watch a broadcast of the eulogies, many dressed in orange. The three were buried next to Ms Bibas's parents, who were also killed in the attack. Hamas released their bodies last week as part of the Gaza ceasefire deal with Israel, though initially the militant group did not release the correct body for Ms Bibas - causing outrage. The body of the Israeli mother-of-two was eventually released and positively identified. Hamas has claimed they were killed in an Israeli airstrike. Israel denies this and says they were killed by their captors. Kfir was the youngest of about 30 children abducted by Hamas. The infant, with red hair and a toothless smile, quickly became well-known across Israel. His ordeal was raised by Israeli leaders on podiums around the world.  The body of journalist and peace activist Oded Lifshitz, who was 83 when he was abducted, was also repatriated at the same time as the Bibas family. Hamas handed over the remains as part of the ceasefire agreement reached with Israel last month that's seen living Israeli hostages swapped with Palestinian prisoners. The four bodies were transferred in black coffins in a carefully orchestrated public display involving dozens of armed Hamas militants - which Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu described as \"despicable\", and UN human rights chief Volker Turk said was \"cruel\" and \"inhumane\".

        "Content": "\n          Political editor\n              @BethRigby\n Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer brushed aside growing tensions between the White House and Europe over Ukraine on Wednesday, saying he trusted Donald Trump and wanted the \"special relationship\" to go \"from strength to strength\". Speaking to reporters ahead of a crucial meeting at the White House, Sir Keir insisted that the UK was working \"in lockstep\" with the president on the matter of Ukraine. Asked if he could trust President Trump in light of what has happened in recent weeks, the prime minister replied \"yes\". \"I've got a good relationship with him,\" Sir Keir said. \"As you know, I've met him, I've spoken to him on the phone, and this relationship between our two countries is a special relationship with a long history, forged as we fought wars together, as we traded together. \"And as I say, I want it to go from strength to strength.\" Politics latest: PM's 'very stupid decision' condemned The prime minister has now arrived in Washington, but even before he touched down, the choreography of the trip hit a little turbulence as President Trump appeared to pour cold water on the prospect of a US military backstop for Ukraine as part of any peace deal - a key UK and European demand.  \"I'm not going to make security guarantees beyond very much,\" Mr Trump said at his first cabinet meeting on Wednesday. \"We're going to have Europe do that because Europe is the next-door neighbour.\" His remarks seemed at odds with those made by the prime minister on the way to Washington as he reiterated how important a US military backstop was for Ukraine. \"We all want a peaceful outcome,\" the prime minister said. \"It's got to be a lasting peace, and that requires us to put in place an effective security guarantee. \"Exactly what the configuration of that is, exactly what the backstop is, is obviously the subject of intense discussion.\" He added: \"But the reason I say the backstop is so important is that the security guarantee has to be sufficient to deter Putin from coming again because my concern is if there is a ceasefire without a backstop, it will simply give him the opportunity to wait and to come again because his ambition in relation to Ukraine is pretty obvious, I think, for all to see.\" Read more:CIA asked to look at UK 'order'Trump threatens 25% tariffs on EU While European allies such as the UK and France are preparing to put peacekeeping troops on the ground to police the Ukraine-Russian borders, leaders have been clear that US support is essential to containing President Putin and securing that support is the key purpose of the prime minister's trip to Washington. President Zelenskyy has also demanded that clear guarantees of US military backing and security be part of his deal with the US on critical minerals, but a framework agreed this week by both sides did not include an explicit reference to any such support.  Ahead of the trip to Washington, the prime minister pledged to increase UK defence spending - a key ask of all NATO members by President Trump - and reiterated his commitment to putting British boots on the ground in Ukraine as he attempts to lower tensions between Europe and the US and demonstrate to President Trump that the UK is willing to play its part. \"When it comes to defence and security, we have for decades acted as a bridge because of the special relationship we have with the US and also our allegiance to our European allies,\" Sir Keir said. \"I've been absolutely resolute that we're not going to choose between one side of the Atlantic and the other. We will work with the US, we will work with our European allies, that's what we've done for decades, and it's what we'll do whilst I'm prime minister.\" ðŸ‘‰Listen to Politics At Jack And Sam's on your podcast appðŸ‘ˆ Sir Keir also gave the British public a \"message of reassurance\" after his decision to accelerate defence spending in the face of Russian aggression, saying he had done it to \"ensure their safety\" and increased investment would bring opportunities. \"I want to reassure the British public that what we're doing is to ensure their safety, their security and defence of our country. \"I want to also be clear that this is an opportunity because, as we increase defence spending, then that gives an opportunity for our industrial strategy, for jobs across the UK, good well-paid jobs in defence.\""

        "Content": "\n          News reporter\n              @SunnyNadal\n  Donald Trump has shared a bizarre AI-generated video on his Truth Social platform showcasing what appears to be a vision of Gaza under his proposed plan. The footage, which the 78-year-old shared without comment, shows the war-ravaged territory before a caption appears: \"Gaza 2025... What's Next?\" It then goes on to show the area transformed into a Middle Eastern paradise with exotic beaches, Dubai-style skyscrapers, luxury yachts and people partying. It includes a \"Trump Gaza\" tower and a gigantic, golden statue of the US president - with miniature versions on sale in a souvenir gift shop. A child is also shown walking in a street, holding a huge, golden balloon of the president's head. The video also features the world leader dancing with a scantily clad belly dancer in a bar - and sunbathing and sipping cocktails by a hotel resort pool with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Elon Musk appears in the footage several times - sitting on a beach eating humous with flatbreads as bearded belly dancers perform on the sand. The billionaire boss of X, Tesla and SpaceX - who also leads the US Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) which has been tasked with cutting government spending - is also shown throwing dollar bills in the air for people. A song written for the video also plays in the background. The lyrics go: \"Donald's coming to set you free, bringing the light for all to see, no more tunnels, no more fear: Trump Gaza's finally here. \"Trump Gaza's shining bright, golden future, a brand new life. \"Feast and dance the deal is done, Trump Gaza number one.\" Sky News has established the video was first shared online in early February by accounts with no apparent connection to the White House. International correspondent Doing the job of a glossy brochure, this video is trying to sell a proposal Donald Trump sketched out several weeks ago. Gaza is \"a demolition site\" he said, that the US would \"take over\" and \"own\".\nÂ  Once it has been levelled, the US president will then construct \"the Riviera of the Mediterranean\". The enclave's 2.3 million residents would be resettled in Jordan or Egypt. \"We just clear out the whole thing,\" says Trump. The legal, ethical and practical challenges associated with this concept are too numerous to mention here - and it was noteworthy that members of his team, like secretary of state Marco Rubio, seemed to row back on the 'Riviera' after its launch. But Trump has not given up on his vision. In the absence of a genuine plan for Gaza's future governance â€“ and the current ceasefire deal has not produced anything that looks like a plan - the US president's invention looks like the only thing sitting on the table.Â  What about the naysayers then â€“ the lawyers, the human rights people and the Palestinians living on this \"demolition site\"? Well, the video is not going to change their minds. Ultimately, this 35-second spectacular is designed to please the president himself. In the virtual world, Trump has already fixed an issue that has bedevilled world leaders since the 1920s. All we have to do, is accept it. Read more from Sky News:Large bruise on Trump's hand prompts speculation over healthWhat you need to know about Trump's Gaza plan Mr Trump announced his plan - for when the war between Israel and Hamas ends - earlier this year. It includes relocating two million Gazans to neighbouring Arab countries and developing the territory into the \"Riviera of the Middle East\". He described Gaza as a \"demolition site\" where \"virtually every building is down\". Laying out his idea of what would happen beyond an Israel-Hamas ceasefire, he proposed: \"The US will take over the Gaza Strip and we will do a job with it too.\" He said America would be \"responsible for dismantling all of the dangerous unexploded bombs and other weapons on the site\", before it would \"get rid of the destroyed buildings\", and \"level it out\". \"Everybody I've spoken to loves the idea of the United States owning that piece of land, developing and creating thousands of jobs,\" he added. The White House described the proposal as \"out-of-the-box\" and \"visionary\" - but it was condemned as the effective \"ethnic cleansing\" of Palestinians from Gaza. Hamas described the proposals as \"ridiculous and absurd\" in a statement from one of its officials. Egypt, Jordan, and Saudi Arabia, which as fellow Arab nations support the Palestinian cause, also rejected Mr Trump's plan. Read more:Analysis: Trump's Gaza plan is so outrageous it might be something bigger Speaking to Sky News' US correspondent Mark Stone, Gaza resident Oday Basheer said in response to the video: \"It was disturbing to watch... it was disturbing from the moment that Trump announced that he was going to enter Gaza and take it and invest in it. \"Today, both sides (Hamas and Israel) are still fighting and we are not reaching any solution that satisfies everyone.\" Mr Basheer said that he fears Gaza will be destroyed and everyone who lives there will be forced to leave. He added: \"This is terrifying, we still don't [know] if we are going to stay here or not... we don't know what's happening tomorrow. \"This is terrifying and this is terrible.\" Meanwhile, there was a mixed reaction to the video in the comments section below it. One person wrote: \"I don't think that's funny or cool. Sorry. Am I missing something??? I hope it's a joke a bad joke..\" \"I hate this. I love our president, but this is horrible,\" said another. One Truth Social user wrote: \"Mr President while I appreciate what you do, is not about you. To God be the glory and the honor, for without Him, you couldn't have accomplished anything. The statue is a symbol of the antichrist, please humble yourself to God. Jesus is king and only Him.\" \"You're doing great Mr President. But don't let it get to your head. God put you in that position for His Glory, not yours,\" said another. \"Can we transform our US cities to look like this 2025 vision first? Our cities are dumps with ugly buildings and homeless people,\" wrote one user. \"Everything looks good, just stay away from these guys,\" said another, reposting a screenshot of the bearded belly dancers."

        "Content": "Donald Trump has said he will impose 25% tariffs on the EU \"very soon\" and claimed the bloc was \"formed in order to screw the United States\". The US president made the remarks while holding his first cabinet meeting at the White House since his inauguration in January. The world's richest man Elon Musk, who leads the US Department of Government Efficiency but is not a cabinet member, was among those present. During his second term as president, Mr Trump has sparked fears of a global trade war by either imposing, or threatening to impose, high tariffs on both America's allies and geopolitical rivals. Earlier this month the US government imposed 25% tariffs on goods imported from Canada and Mexico and a 10% tariff on imports from China. Beijing retaliated by imposing 10% duties on many US imports and 15% tariffs on coal and liquefied natural gas. Meanwhile, the 25% tariffs on Mexico and Canada were paused after agreements were reached on border security. 'They've taken advantage of us' Asked whether he had made a decision about imposing tariffs on the European Union, Mr Trump said: \"We have made a decision, we'll be announcing it very soon and it will be 25% generally speaking and that will be on cars and all other things. \"The European Union is a different case than Canada, a different kind of case, they've really taken advantage of us in a different way. \"They don't accept our cars, they don't accept essentially our farm products. They use all sorts of reasons why not, and we accept everything from them, and we have about a $300bn (Â£237bn) deficit with the European Union.\" He added: \"The European Union, it was formed in order to screw the United States. \"Let's be honest - the European Union was formed in order to screw the United States, that's the purpose of it, and they've done a good job of it, but now I'm president.\"  Asked what he will do if the EU retaliates, Mr Trump said: \"They can't, I mean, they can try, but they can't.\" He added: \"They can retaliate, but it cannot be a successful retaliation, because we just go cold turkey, we don't buy anymore. \"If that happens, we win.\" A European Commission spokesperson said in response to Mr Trump's comments: \"The EU will react firmly and immediately against unjustified barriers to free and fair trade, including when tariffs are used to challenge legal and non-discriminatory policies. \"The European Union is the world's largest free market. And it has been a boon for the United States.\" The threat of tariffs comes at a time of fragile relations between the US and Europe as the Trump administration appears to favour Moscow over Kyiv as it tries to bring about peace in Ukraine. Mr Trump shocked European leaders last week by calling Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy a \"dictator with no elections\". Mr Zelenskyy accused the US president of living in a Russian-made \"disinformation space\".

The US president views the transaction with Ukraine as a fair way to recoup the billions of dollars that America has given Kyiv - via weapons and financial support - to help in their fight against Russia. ðŸ‘‰ Follow Trump 100 on your podcast app ðŸ‘ˆ Mr Trump went on to describe Russian President Vladimir Putin as a \"very smart\" and \"very cunning person\" during the cabinet meeting. He said: \"I think he wanted the whole (of Ukraine) when I got elected, (then) we spoke, and I think we're going to have a deal.\" Ukraine NATO membership ruled out Mr Trump also said he believes Mr Putin would never have invaded Ukraine if he was US president at the time. Asked whether Ukraine could gain NATO membership, the US president said: \"You can forget about it. That's probably the reason the whole thing started.\" Mr Trump declined to comment when asked about whether he would ever allow China to take control of Taiwan by force. \"I never comment on that,\" said. \"I don't want to ever put myself in that position.\" Mr Musk spoke briefly at the start of the meeting to explain why he believes the controversial cost-cutting measures his department has been carrying out have been necessary. Cabinet members were then asked by reporters if they were happy with Mr Musk and how he has been carrying out his role. Mr Musk started to answer the question, but Mr Trump interjected and said he might want to let cabinet members answer, before joking that if anyone disagreed, he might \"throw them out\"."

        "Content": " Gossip Girl and Buffy The Vampire actress Michelle Trachtenberg has died aged 39. The actress was found dead at her home in New York City after officers responded to a 911 call just after 8am local time this morning. An investigation into her death has been opened but \"criminality is not suspected\", police said. \"The family requests privacy for their loss,\" Trachtenberg's representative, Gary Mantoosh, said in a statement on Wednesday. Trachtenberg was best known for her role as Dawn Summers in Buffy, the younger sister of the title character played by Sarah Michelle Gellar between 2000 and 2003. Between 2008 and 2012, she played Georgina Sparks on Gossip Girl - the malevolent rival of Blake Lively's Serena van der Woodsen and Leighton Meester's Blair Waldorf. \"We are deeply saddened by the news of Michelle's passing. Michelle was so funny, kind, and talented,\" said a joint statement of \"Gossip Girl\" creators Josh Schwartz and Stephanie Savage. \"Her portrayal of Georgina Sparks was an iconic fan favourite, and grew from a one-season villain to a beloved character who returned over the course of six seasons. She was a delight to have on set and will be deeply missed. Our thoughts are with her family.\" She also starred in the movie 17 Again, where she portrayed daughter Maggie O'Donnell, comedy film Eurotrip and the 2005 teen film Ice Princess. Kim Cattrall, who played rink owner and figure skater Tina Harwood in Ice Princess, posted a picture of herself and Trachtenberg from that movie. Trachtenberg thanked Gellar for speaking out against Joss Whedon in 2021, following abuse allegations made against the Buffy showrunner. \"I am brave enough now as a 35-year-old woman to repost this,\" she wrote on social media, and alluded to \"his not appropriate behaviour\" she experienced as a teenage actor. In response to claims on the set of Buffy, Mr Whedon told Vulture that he was not as \"civilised\" as he was now and admitted yelling at the cast - but dismissed several other claims. Meanwhile, her co-star on Gossip Girl Ed Westwick said in an Instagram Story that he was \"so sad to hear of the passing of Michelle Trachtenberg sending prayers\". Buffy the Vampire Slayer co-star David Boreanaz said on Instagram it was \"so very sad.. horrible news\".

In a further row back of climate targets the company has said renewable energy investment will fall by $5bn (Â£3.95bn) a year to just $1bn to $2bn (Â£790m to Â£1.58bn). Less than half that investment will go to low-carbon energy. Funding for further oil and gas extraction will grow to $10bn (Â£7.9bn) annually as the business shifts focus back to its original mission of extracting fossil fuels. The majority (70%) of the funding will go to oil with the remaining 30% funding gas projects. Money blog: BA named joint worst airline out of 19 for long-haul flights New \"major\" oil and gas projects are to start by the end of 2027 with eight to 10 more to begin by the end of 2030. The company also said it will have \"selective\" investment in biogas, biofuels and electric vehicle (EV) charging and \"capital-light partnerships\" in renewables like wind and solar. Under the tenure of old chief executive Bernard Looney, BP had dropped its 2020 goal of cutting production, revising it down in 2023 from 40% to 25%. The aim of dropping its oil and gas output by 2030 has been axed. \n                  Five years on from BP's ambitious pledge, the climate has changed in every sense\n                 \n                  'Suspected unexploded device' discovered near North Sea FLAGS pipeline\n                 \n                  Middle East conflict: Oil prices climb as violence escalates\n                 The International Energy Agency has said no new fossil fuel project is compatible with the globally accepted goal of limiting warming to 1.5C. But BP now aims to grow production to 2.3 million to 2.5 million barrels of oil a day in 2030. Why is this happening? \"Today we have fundamentally reset BP's strategy,\" chief executive Murray Auchincloss said. \"This is all in service of sustainably growing cash flow and returns.\" BP went \"too far too fast\", Mr Auchincloss said, due to \"misplaced\" optimism on the pace of energy transition and decarbonisation which was not as fast as he envisioned. This latest scaleback comes as BP faces pressure from activist investor Elliott Management, which reportedly took a 5% share of the company. Elliott is renowned for forcing changes in companies to increase the share price and was reportedly pushing for a sale of BP's renewable arm. BP's share price had dipped below the all-time high in February 2023 and company profits have come off the record level in 2022. Dividends and company performance have been lower at BP than at its energy-producing peers. The current CEO Mr Auchincloss announced plans in January to cut BP's workforce by 5% - reducing the headcount by 4,700 - as he sought to achieve $2bn (Â£1.62bn) of cost savings. It comes as the world breached the key 1.5-degree threshold in the 12 months from June 2023 to May 2024. Countries including the UK signed up to the Paris Agreement to limit global warming to the 1.5 target. There's been a sector-wide retreat from green investment, however, as US President Donald Trump pledged to \"drill baby drill\"."

His pitch was striking and very much of the moment. A multinational that began as the Anglo-Persian Oil Company in 1909 would move away from its core products, cutting annual oil production, investing in renewable energy, and even suggested leaving some of its assets in the ground, unexploited. Money blog: How much do you need to earn to be wealthy? The aim, Mr Looney said, was to make BP net-zero by 2050, and to help the world do the same, an aspiration environmental campaigners never dared to imagine they would hear from a fossil fuel giant. For all the styling, this was not an altruistic move from Mr Looney and the BP board. \n                  BP slashes renewables investment and boosts fossil fuel production\n                 \n                  'Suspected unexploded device' discovered near North Sea FLAGS pipeline\n                 \n                  Middle East conflict: Oil prices climb as violence escalates\n                 With global leaders signed up to cutting carbon emissions and consumers increasingly enthusiastic about the alternatives, they saw money in the pivot to alternative sources.  COVID, only just beginning its circumnavigation of the globe when Mr Looney got to his feet in February 2020, may have reinforced faith in his bet, as skies went quiet and commuters stayed at home. One fundamental question remained unanswered: Could BP continue to fund the dividends and return to shareholders by which markets, not activists, judge oil majors, and on which many investors depend for retirement funds to thrive? Five years on the answer is no, and the climate has changed, in every sense. Mr Looney is gone, dismissed for being a little too charismatic in undisclosed relationships with employees, and his successor, Canadian Murray Auchincloss, has seen the wind turn against his company and its chosen course. COVID was followed by the Russian invasion of Ukraine and a spike in energy prices that delivered a windfall to oil and gas majors and their shareholders. BP delivered a profit of $13.8bn but comparison with its competitors, notably Shell, is unflattering. Read more:Who's given Ukraine most aid - and does it have enough rare earth metals to 'pay back' US? Its share price has lagged as oil and gas have proved both cheaper and more profitable than wind and solar in an inflationary environment. Its debts meanwhile have grown, swollen by borrowing to fund major investments in renewables, while Shell's have been cut courtesy of post-Ukraine profits. With investor sentiment turning, accelerated by activist fund Elliott, which has built a reported 5% stake, Mr Auchincloss has slammed on the brakes. Under pressure after five quarters of unreliable revenue, profit and debt forecasts, he is taking British Petroleum back to petroleum. Back to basics The contrast with Mr Looney's strategic reset could not have been more marked. Speaking on a webcast with only a small in-person audience, the sober Mr Auchincloss stood next to a new slogan: \"Growing shareholder value\", in a mixed-case, formal typeface. His analysis was equally clear: \"In 2020 we made some bold strategic changes, accelerating into the energy transition while progressively reducing our hydrocarbon business. \"We then saw COVID, the war in Ukraine, a recession and the shift in attitudes of markets and governments have a fundamental impact on the energy system... Our optimism for a fast (energy) transition was misplaced, and we went too far, too fast.\" His alternative can be summarised as back to basics. Oil production will increase, almost to 2019 levels, and capital investment will be focused on oil and gas, 75% of it on \"upstream\" extraction, and less than 5% spent on renewables. Mr Auchincloss's case is that oil and gas will be in \"robust\" global demand until 2035, and his message to shareholders is he intends to exploit it for their benefit. No consensus Not all shareholders agree, with 48 UK investors demanding a vote on the reset, and the UK Sustainable Investment Finance Association denouncing it as a retrograde turn away from the energy of the future that could leave BP saddled with stranded assets. Coming on the same day the UK government's Climate Change Committee (CCC) painted a picture of an inexorable transition to low-carbon energy, driven by electrification of home heating, cars and industry, it is an unsentimental bet on the carbon status quo, and on short-term returns. By the 2040s, says the CCC, electric vehicles will be so ubiquitous that petrol stations will be hard to find. Mr Auchincloss appears to be banking on BP forecourts being among them."

        "Content": "Donald Trump has said he will impose 25% tariffs on the EU \"very soon\" and claimed the bloc was \"formed in order to screw the United States\". The US president made the remarks while holding his first cabinet meeting at the White House since his inauguration in January. The world's richest man Elon Musk, who leads the US Department of Government Efficiency but is not a cabinet member, was among those present. During his second term as president, Mr Trump has sparked fears of a global trade war by either imposing, or threatening to impose, high tariffs on both America's allies and geopolitical rivals. Earlier this month the US government imposed 25% tariffs on goods imported from Canada and Mexico and a 10% tariff on imports from China. Beijing retaliated by imposing 10% duties on many US imports and 15% tariffs on coal and liquefied natural gas. Meanwhile, the 25% tariffs on Mexico and Canada were paused after agreements were reached on border security. 'They've taken advantage of us' Asked whether he had made a decision about imposing tariffs on the European Union, Mr Trump said: \"We have made a decision, we'll be announcing it very soon and it will be 25% generally speaking and that will be on cars and all other things. \"The European Union is a different case than Canada, a different kind of case, they've really taken advantage of us in a different way. \"They don't accept our cars, they don't accept essentially our farm products. They use all sorts of reasons why not, and we accept everything from them, and we have about a $300bn (Â£237bn) deficit with the European Union.\" He added: \"The European Union, it was formed in order to screw the United States. \"Let's be honest - the European Union was formed in order to screw the United States, that's the purpose of it, and they've done a good job of it, but now I'm president.\"  Asked what he will do if the EU retaliates, Mr Trump said: \"They can't, I mean, they can try, but they can't.\" He added: \"They can retaliate, but it cannot be a successful retaliation, because we just go cold turkey, we don't buy anymore. \"If that happens, we win.\" A European Commission spokesperson said in response to Mr Trump's comments: \"The EU will react firmly and immediately against unjustified barriers to free and fair trade, including when tariffs are used to challenge legal and non-discriminatory policies. \"The European Union is the world's largest free market. And it has been a boon for the United States.\" The threat of tariffs comes at a time of fragile relations between the US and Europe as the Trump administration appears to favour Moscow over Kyiv as it tries to bring about peace in Ukraine.

        "Content": "\n          City editor\n              @MarkKleinmanSky\n Heathrow Airport is in talks with scores of airlines including British Airways about a once-a-decade overhaul of its occupancy - which could lead to some being forced to relocate their long-standing bases. Sky News has learnt that Heathrow has opened negotiations with the 82 carriers which fly from the airport with a view to implementing operational changes aimed at better using its capacity during the coming years. The last such set of discussions with carriers is understood to have taken place more than a decade ago. It was unclear on Wednesday what stage the talks were at, or how fundamental the resulting changes would be, although airlines with major workforces at Heathrow are expected to try to moderate or resist enforced relocations. By far the most significant operator at Heathrow is BA, which moved into the Â£4.3bn Terminal 5 in March 2008. T5 is used exclusively by the airline, and handles more than 30m passengers annually. Industry sources described the possibility of BA relocating its existing Heathrow home as highly unlikely. \n                  British Airways flights delayed after 'technical issue'\n                 \n                  British Airways halts flights to Beijing\n                 \n                  'Worst' airlines for customer service named by consumer group - but firms say survey is 'misleading'\n                 A BA spokesman declined to comment. Other major airline users of Heathrow include Qatar Airways, American Airlines, Singapore Airlines and Virgin Atlantic. Read more:BP slashes renewables investment and boosts fossil fuel productionWho's given Ukraine most aid - and does it have enough rare earth metals to 'pay back' US? Sources said Heathrow's review could lead to a wide-ranging shift in space allocation at the airport. One industry insider speculated that members of the Star Alliance, which include Air Canada, Singapore Airlines and Lufthansa and which largely operate out of Terminal 2, could be among those affected by the shake-up. Responding to an enquiry from Sky News, a spokesman for Heathrow said: \"Occupancy reviews are a normal part of running the airport - it's how we ensure we make best use of the space that we have. \"We undertake these reviews usually once a decade to accommodate for changes in airline operations and airport infrastructure - the last review was in 2014 to coincide with the opening of Terminal 2.\" The spokesman added that its \"objective in these reviews is to make the best use of the limited space at Heathrow, particularly focusing on driving overall operational resilience and matching available capacity with demand - this enables us to protect passenger experience of travelling through the airport\". He said occupancy decision were made \"in consultation with the entire airline community\". On Wednesday, Heathrow said it would pay a dividend to shareholders for the first time in five years, with such payouts having been stymied by the pandemic. The Â£250m payment comes as the Labour government seeks to boost economic growth by approving an unprecedented wave of aviation capacity projects. Last year, Heathrow served close to 84m passengers, with pre-tax profits rising 31% to Â£917m. Heidi Alexander, the transport secretary, is expected to give the green light to expansion at Gatwick, London's second-biggest airport, this week, while Heathrow is reviving plans for a third runway after years of political and public protests. Heathrow said on Wednesday: \"We welcome the government's endorsement of a third runway at Heathrow - we are submitting our proposals to the government this summer. \"We are working with ministers to agree the policy changes needed to deliver the project successfully. \"Our aim is to meet the government's ambition to secure planning permission before the end of this parliament.\""

        "Content": "\n          Climate reporter\n              @SeabrookClimate\n Something has changed dramatically in your home in a way you won't have even noticed. The electricity in your plug socket no longer comes from coal, the workhorse of the industrial revolution that powered our economy for decades but which is also the most polluting fossil fuel. Now it is generated by cleaner gas, renewable and nuclear power. That shift has helped the UK cut greenhouse gas emissions by 50% since 1990 - a world-leading feat - and you won't have batted an eyelid. That's about to change. The country's climate advisers, the Climate Change Committee (CCC), say in new advice today that emissions of greenhouse gases need to fall 87% by 2040. One third of those emissions cuts will come from decisions made by households. \n                  More heat pumps, fewer kebabs - Is this the way to stop climate change?\n                 \n                  Heat pumps, EVs and fewer kebabs: You'll notice the next cut to emissions - but half the work is done\n                 \n                  How net zero push is impacting Britain's economy - including some nice salary bumps\n                 While the first stage of the country's national climate action has \"gone largely unnoticed\", the next phase will be \"a lot more difficult\", said Adam Berman from Energy UK, which represents energy suppliers. \"It's going to be technically more difficult, it is going to be much more visceral and tangible to people in their everyday lives. It affects how they get to work, what they use to heat their homes and even diet.\"  Experts say if we get it right, it will make our lives better with cleaner air and better public transport. It would also shave hundreds of pounds off annual household bills. But it depends on what the government does next to help people. Read more:Heat pumps, EVs, kebabs: You'll notice the next cut to emissions The way we travel The two \"most impactful\" things households can do are replacing their car with an electric one and a gas boiler with a heat pump (only when they pack up, and not before), the advice said. By 2040, the share of electric cars on the road needs to jump from 2.8% in 2023 to 80% in order to meet net zero, according to the recommendations, which the government is not obliged to accept. They are already \"generally\" cheaper to run than petrol or diesel cars, while the falling cost of batteries means EVs should finally cost the same upfront in the next three years. The committee's chief executive Emma Pinchbeck said: \"Frankly, by the time a lot of people are going to be choosing a new car, the electric vehicle is just going to be the cheapest [option].\" How we heat our homes But while the switch to electric vehicles is powering ahead, the move to greener home heating has barely left the starting blocks. Homes are currently the second highest-emitting sector in the UK economy, and much of that comes from the way we heat them. The CCC today put to bed calls to keep gas boilers but run them on hydrogen, recommending there be \"no role for hydrogen heating in residential buildings\". Hydrogen is hard to produce in a green way, and so would be reserved for other sectors that have no other viable alternatives. The government is yet to confirm this decision, which would dismay the gas networks and boiler manufacturers. Instead, the advisers said people should eventually replace boilers with heat pumps, which run on electricity and work a bit like a fridge in reverse: grabbing and compressing warmth from the outside air and using it to heat your home. Amid a political row over the costs of net zero, the analysis concluded these two switches could save households around Â£700 a year on heating bills and a further Â£700 on motoring costs. Cutting down on meat and on excessive flying will also play an important, but smaller role they said. The upfront investment will cost the equivalent of 0.2% of GDP, most of which would come from the private sector. Overcoming the costs But at the moment the benefits of these green switches are not spread fairly, and some people can't access them at all. The upfront costs of a heat pump - and home upgrades needed alongside - are \"sizeable\" and price out poorer households, even with current government subsidies, campaigners and the CCC said. Zachary Leather, an economist at the Resolution Foundation thinktank, said: \"While politicians fret and argue about the cost of net zero, today's report shows that there are long-term benefits for consumers and the environment.\" But the government needs to \"get serious\" about helping lower-income households to adopt heat pumps and EVs so they can save money too, he said. Meanwhile, it is still cheaper for someone with a driveway to charge their EV than someone who charges theirs on the street - and electricity prices overall should be made cheaper to help people reap the benefits. Mr Berman from Energy UK said: \"All through the energy system there are these small examples that tend to mean working class households find it more expensive to take up low carbon alternatives.\"  The energy transition is 'not fair yet' It also comes at a time of wavering support for climate action. While Labour was elected on a mandate to go faster on climate action, the Conservatives have retreated from green issues, and Reform UK wants to dismantle net zero altogether. Mr Berman said a way to \"resolve that question of public consent is to ensure we're rolling out that infrastructure in a really, really fair and inclusive way. And we're not there yet\". The public are also confused about if, when and how to switch to these green technologies, and which government should tackle this with clearer guidance, the CCC said. Energy Secretary Ed Miliband said: \"This advice is independent of government policy, and we will now consider it and respond in due course. \"It is clear that the best route to making Britain energy secure, bringing down bills and creating jobs is by embracing the clean energy transition. This government's clean energy superpower mission is about doing so in a way that grows our economy and makes working people better off. \"We owe it to current generations to seize the opportunities for energy security and lower bills, and we owe it to future generations to tackle the existential climate crisis.\""

Speaking to reporters ahead of a crucial meeting at the White House, Sir Keir insisted that the UK was working \"in lockstep\" with the president on the matter of Ukraine. Asked if he could trust President Trump in light of what has happened in recent weeks, the prime minister replied \"yes\". \"I've got a good relationship with him,\" Sir Keir said. \"As you know, I've met him, I've spoken to him on the phone, and this relationship between our two countries is a special relationship with a long history, forged as we fought wars together, as we traded together. \"And as I say, I want it to go from strength to strength.\" Politics latest: PM's 'very stupid decision' condemned The prime minister has now arrived in Washington, but even before he touched down, the choreography of the trip hit a little turbulence as President Trump appeared to pour cold water on the prospect of a US military backstop for Ukraine as part of any peace deal - a key UK and European demand.  \"I'm not going to make security guarantees beyond very much,\" Mr Trump said at his first cabinet meeting on Wednesday. \"We're going to have Europe do that because Europe is the next-door neighbour.\" His remarks seemed at odds with those made by the prime minister on the way to Washington as he reiterated how important a US military backstop was for Ukraine. \"We all want a peaceful outcome,\" the prime minister said. \"It's got to be a lasting peace, and that requires us to put in place an effective security guarantee. \"Exactly what the configuration of that is, exactly what the backstop is, is obviously the subject of intense discussion.\" He added: \"But the reason I say the backstop is so important is that the security guarantee has to be sufficient to deter Putin from coming again because my concern is if there is a ceasefire without a backstop, it will simply give him the opportunity to wait and to come again because his ambition in relation to Ukraine is pretty obvious, I think, for all to see.\" Read more:CIA asked to look at UK 'order'Trump threatens 25% tariffs on EU While European allies such as the UK and France are preparing to put peacekeeping troops on the ground to police the Ukraine-Russian borders, leaders have been clear that US support is essential to containing President Putin and securing that support is the key purpose of the prime minister's trip to Washington. President Zelenskyy has also demanded that clear guarantees of US military backing and security be part of his deal with the US on critical minerals, but a framework agreed this week by both sides did not include an explicit reference to any such support.  Ahead of the trip to Washington, the prime minister pledged to increase UK defence spending - a key ask of all NATO members by President Trump - and reiterated his commitment to putting British boots on the ground in Ukraine as he attempts to lower tensions between Europe and the US and demonstrate to President Trump that the UK is willing to play its part. \"When it comes to defence and security, we have for decades acted as a bridge because of the special relationship we have with the US and also our allegiance to our European allies,\" Sir Keir said. \"I've been absolutely resolute that we're not going to choose between one side of the Atlantic and the other. We will work with the US, we will work with our European allies, that's what we've done for decades, and it's what we'll do whilst I'm prime minister.\" ðŸ‘‰Listen to Politics At Jack And Sam's on your podcast appðŸ‘ˆ Sir Keir also gave the British public a \"message of reassurance\" after his decision to accelerate defence spending in the face of Russian aggression, saying he had done it to \"ensure their safety\" and increased investment would bring opportunities. \"I want to reassure the British public that what we're doing is to ensure their safety, their security and defence of our country. \"I want to also be clear that this is an opportunity because, as we increase defence spending, then that gives an opportunity for our industrial strategy, for jobs across the UK, good well-paid jobs in defence.\""

        "Content": "\n          Political reporter\n              @alexrogerssky\n  Sir Keir Starmer has been accused of failing to guarantee the recently announced uplift in defence spending will not be spent on the contentious Chagos Islands deal. After initially refusing to set out a timeline to increase defence spending to 2.5% of GDP, the prime minister confirmed on Tuesday the threshold would be met by 2027, with an ambition to reach 3% in the next parliament. The move has been funded by a cut in the foreign aid budget from 0.5% of GDP to 0.3%, which the government says will release Â£13.4bn annually for defence - although experts say the figure is closer to half that, at Â£6bn. Despite the move being welcomed by the main opposition parties, there have been questions as to whether the uptick in spending could be used to fund the Chagos deal, which would transfer the Indian Ocean archipelago to Mauritius after a decades-long dispute. Politics latest: Badenoch takes credit for defence plan The agreement includes the tropical atoll of Diego Garcia, home to a UK-US military base that plays a crucial role in the region's stability and international security. Under the proposed agreement, the UK would lease back Diego Garcia for 99 years at a reported annual cost of around Â£90m. Although the Biden administration welcomed the deal as a \"win for diplomacy\", Donald Trump's White House has expressed reservations about the deal owing to its concerns over China's influence in Mauritius. During Prime Minister's Questions, Tory leader Kemi Badenoch asked whether the increase in defence spending would be used to fund the Chagos deal. \"This morning the defence secretary could not say if the Chagos deal would come out of the defence budget,\" she said. \"Can he confirm to the House that none of the defence uplift includes payments for his Chagos deal?\" The prime minister replied: \"The additional spend I announced yesterday is for our capability on defence and security in Europe, as I made absolutely clear yesterday. \"The Chagos deal is extremely important for our security, for US security. The US are rightly looking at it. When it's finalised I'll put it before the House with the costings.\" He said \"the figures being bandied around\" were \"absolutely wide of the mark\", adding: \"The deal is well over a century but the funding I announced yesterday is for our capability to put ourselves in a position to rise to a generational challenge, that is what that money is all about and I thought she supported it.\" Later, Downing Street did not rule out that money from increased defence spending could be used as part of the Chagos deal. Asked about Sir Keir's response to questions about whether any of the new money will be spent on the deal, the prime minister's official spokesman said: \"The uplift announced yesterday will be going on our military capabilities, technology, adopting cutting-edge capabilities that are vital to retain a decisive edge as threats rapidly evolve\". Read more:Landmark moment Trump's return stuns UK into actionLove Actually-style moment unlikely with PM and Trump He later added: \"We'll obviously present the details of the Chagos deal as and when it's finalised.\" Experts have questioned the Â£13.4bn figure used by the government, arguing that a 0.2% increase amounted to an extra Â£6bn in cash terms. Ben Zaranko, associate director at the Institute for Fiscal Studies, said the prime minister \"followed in the steps of the last government by announcing a misleadingly large figure for the 'extra' defence spending this announcement entails\". \"An extra 0.2% of GDP is around Â£6bn, and this is the size of the cut to the aid budget. Yet he trumpeted a Â£13bn increase in defence spending. \"It's hard to be certain without more detail from the Treasury, but this figure only seems to make sense if one thinks the defence budget would otherwise have been frozen in cash terms.\""

Following the deaths of 72 people in the 2017 Grenfell Tower fire, Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner has given the government's response to the inquiry, published in September after seven years. The government has accepted the findings of the report, which found \"systematic dishonesty\" contributed to the devastating fire and there were years of missed opportunities to prevent the catastrophe. Politics latest: Starmer addresses boosting defence spending Seven organisations criticised in the report will now be investigated under the Procurement Act, Ms Rayner said. If they are determined to have \"engaged in professional misconduct\" their names will be added to a \"debarment list\", which all contracting authorities will have to take into account when awarding new contracts.

London Mayor Sadiq Khan said companies named and shamed in the report \"should be barred from future contracts\" and \"this must now finally happen without further delay\". Ms Rayner, who is also the housing secretary, said the government \"accepts the findings\" of the inquiry and it will \"prioritise residents and protect their interests, and make sure that industry builds safe homes, and provide clearer accountability and enforcement\". She apologised again to the families and friends of those who died, survivors and those who live around the tower. \"To have anyone anywhere living in an unsafe home is one person too many,\" she told the House of Commons. \"That will be our guiding principle and must be that of anyone who wants to build or care for our homes. That will be an important part of the legacy of Grenfell.\"  More training for social housing tenants She announced \"stronger protections\" for social housing tenants, giving them more power to challenge landlords and demand safe, high-quality housing. The \"Four Million Homes\" training will be expanded - a government-funded initiative that provides guidance and training for social housing tenants. News correspondent For Grenfell survivors, time has become an ever-growing source of pain. In the days after the fire, none of them could have imagined nearly eight years later there would still be no arrests. They waited seven years for a public inquiry to complete its work, and today they heard it could take another three to four years for its recommendations to take effect - with no guarantees those will even be implemented â€˜\"in full\". Edward Daffarn, a survivor and campaigner with Grenfell United, said it is like being on a \"carousel of delay\". \n\"Even if the government's intentions are the right ones,\" he said. He finds the fact that nine of Sir Martin Moore-Bick's 58 recommendations have been accepted only \"in principle\" deeply concerning. One of those is the establishment of a single regulator for the construction industry.  The government plans to create this, but will stop short of allowing it to take back public control of testing and certification of construction products, or to issue compliance certificates. Mr Daffarn called that simply \"baffling\".Â If all recommendations are properly implemented, he said, meaningful change is possible. But he fears they have years of campaigning still to go before that day comes.Â  However, the National Housing Federation (NHF), which represents about 800 housing associations, said it missed the point as it said social housing tenants cannot access government funding to remove dangerous cladding - and manufacturers of unsafe materials have not contributed to the costs. Kate Henderson, chief executive of the NHF, told Sky News: \"The money to fund this work is coming from people on the lowest incomes in this country, and to make matters worse, means fewer homes will be built for those in dire situations on housing waiting lists, living in overcrowded homes and stuck in temporary accommodation. \"The government must put an end to this unfair funding regime and give social housing providers and their residents equal access to building safety funding.\" Ms Rayner also announced: â€¢ A new single construction regulator so those responsible for building safety are held to account â€¢ Tougher oversight of testing and certifying, manufacturing and using construction products - with \"serious consequences\" for those who break the rules â€¢ A legal duty of candour through a \"new Hillsborough Law\", so public authorities must disclose the truth â€¢ Stronger, clearer and enforceable legal rights for residents so landlords are responsible for acting on safety concerns â€¢ A publicly accessible record of all public inquiry recommendations Polly Neate, chief executive of housing and homelessness charity Shelter, said it is \"right\" the government has committed to take forward all the inquiry's recommendations but said it needs to boost funding for legal aid so people can actually enforce their rights as tenants. Earlier this month, the government announced the tower, which has stood covered in scaffolding since the fire nearly eight years ago, will be \"carefully\" demolished in a process likely to take two years."

Tulsi Gabbard, the US director of national intelligence (DNI), announced the measures in a letter to two US politicians who had raised concerns about the move. Apple last week withdrew some of its secure storage features from the UK.

John Swinney said he \"accepts and understands that people are angry\" but is worried that in response to the discord some are finding \"attractiveness in the politics of Farage and the far right\". Speaking at a press conference at Bute House in Edinburgh on Wednesday, the SNP leader said: \"And I think that's the wrong choice. \"And I'm simply making the point today that it's important that those of us who are repulsed by the politics of Farage and the far right come together to give the leadership and stress the importance of the values that we hold dear about our society.\" Reform UK - led by Mr Farage - is surging in the polls in Scotland with multiple surveys suggesting it could pick up seats at next year's Holyrood election. Mr Swinney singled out Mr Farage, saying: \"There is a very live and active threat to our security from the aggression of Russia and I think Farage is an accomplice to the Russian agenda and an apologist for the Russian agenda. \"Farage has been for years leading the argument which has been hostile to migration and I think that is based on a fundamentally racist view of the world - I reject that.

Mr Swinney had warned if the budget had failed to pass it would have served the interests of the far right and \"leave devolution dangerously exposed\". The first minister said \"storm clouds are gathering - we can all see them\" as he announced plans for a summit of political leaders and civic society to tackle the surge in far-right support. The gathering - due to be held at the end of April - will feature representatives from Scotland's churches, trade unions, charities and parliamentary parties. Mr Swinney hopes all those involved will \"work together, for decency, democracy and respect\". He said: \"It is time to come together to draw a line in the sand.

Sir Keir Starmer has defended the decision to slash development assistance aid from 0.5% of gross national income to 0.3% in the next two years.

        "Content": "\n          Climate reporter\n              @SeabrookClimate\n Something has changed dramatically in your home in a way you won't have even noticed. The electricity in your plug socket no longer comes from coal, the workhorse of the industrial revolution that powered our economy for decades but which is also the most polluting fossil fuel. Now it is generated by cleaner gas, renewable and nuclear power. That shift has helped the UK cut greenhouse gas emissions by 50% since 1990 - a world-leading feat - and you won't have batted an eyelid. That's about to change. The country's climate advisers, the Climate Change Committee (CCC), say in new advice today that emissions of greenhouse gases need to fall 87% by 2040. One third of those emissions cuts will come from decisions made by households. \n                  More heat pumps, fewer kebabs - Is this the way to stop climate change?\n                 \n                  Heat pumps, EVs and fewer kebabs: You'll notice the next cut to emissions - but half the work is done\n                 \n                  How net zero push is impacting Britain's economy - including some nice salary bumps\n                 While the first stage of the country's national climate action has \"gone largely unnoticed\", the next phase will be \"a lot more difficult\", said Adam Berman from Energy UK, which represents energy suppliers. \"It's going to be technically more difficult, it is going to be much more visceral and tangible to people in their everyday lives. It affects how they get to work, what they use to heat their homes and even diet.\"  Experts say if we get it right, it will make our lives better with cleaner air and better public transport. It would also shave hundreds of pounds off annual household bills. But it depends on what the government does next to help people. Read more:Heat pumps, EVs, kebabs: You'll notice the next cut to emissions The way we travel The two \"most impactful\" things households can do are replacing their car with an electric one and a gas boiler with a heat pump (only when they pack up, and not before), the advice said. By 2040, the share of electric cars on the road needs to jump from 2.8% in 2023 to 80% in order to meet net zero, according to the recommendations, which the government is not obliged to accept. They are already \"generally\" cheaper to run than petrol or diesel cars, while the falling cost of batteries means EVs should finally cost the same upfront in the next three years. The committee's chief executive Emma Pinchbeck said: \"Frankly, by the time a lot of people are going to be choosing a new car, the electric vehicle is just going to be the cheapest [option].\" How we heat our homes But while the switch to electric vehicles is powering ahead, the move to greener home heating has barely left the starting blocks. Homes are currently the second highest-emitting sector in the UK economy, and much of that comes from the way we heat them. The CCC today put to bed calls to keep gas boilers but run them on hydrogen, recommending there be \"no role for hydrogen heating in residential buildings\". Hydrogen is hard to produce in a green way, and so would be reserved for other sectors that have no other viable alternatives. The government is yet to confirm this decision, which would dismay the gas networks and boiler manufacturers. Instead, the advisers said people should eventually replace boilers with heat pumps, which run on electricity and work a bit like a fridge in reverse: grabbing and compressing warmth from the outside air and using it to heat your home. Amid a political row over the costs of net zero, the analysis concluded these two switches could save households around Â£700 a year on heating bills and a further Â£700 on motoring costs. Cutting down on meat and on excessive flying will also play an important, but smaller role they said. The upfront investment will cost the equivalent of 0.2% of GDP, most of which would come from the private sector. Overcoming the costs But at the moment the benefits of these green switches are not spread fairly, and some people can't access them at all. The upfront costs of a heat pump - and home upgrades needed alongside - are \"sizeable\" and price out poorer households, even with current government subsidies, campaigners and the CCC said. Zachary Leather, an economist at the Resolution Foundation thinktank, said: \"While politicians fret and argue about the cost of net zero, today's report shows that there are long-term benefits for consumers and the environment.\" But the government needs to \"get serious\" about helping lower-income households to adopt heat pumps and EVs so they can save money too, he said. Meanwhile, it is still cheaper for someone with a driveway to charge their EV than someone who charges theirs on the street - and electricity prices overall should be made cheaper to help people reap the benefits. Mr Berman from Energy UK said: \"All through the energy system there are these small examples that tend to mean working class households find it more expensive to take up low carbon alternatives.\"  The energy transition is 'not fair yet' It also comes at a time of wavering support for climate action. While Labour was elected on a mandate to go faster on climate action, the Conservatives have retreated from green issues, and Reform UK wants to dismantle net zero altogether. Mr Berman said a way to \"resolve that question of public consent is to ensure we're rolling out that infrastructure in a really, really fair and inclusive way. And we're not there yet\". The public are also confused about if, when and how to switch to these green technologies, and which government should tackle this with clearer guidance, the CCC said. Energy Secretary Ed Miliband said: \"This advice is independent of government policy, and we will now consider it and respond in due course. \"It is clear that the best route to making Britain energy secure, bringing down bills and creating jobs is by embracing the clean energy transition. This government's clean energy superpower mission is about doing so in a way that grows our economy and makes working people better off. \"We owe it to current generations to seize the opportunities for energy security and lower bills, and we owe it to future generations to tackle the existential climate crisis.\""

        "Content": "\n          Scotland correspondent\n              @ConnorGillies\n Alex Salmond's Scottish independence party faces turmoil over bullying claims and questions over future relations with Nigel Farage after the former first minister's death. The 69-year-old leader of the Alba party died of a heart attack in North Macedonia last year. He brought Scotland to the brink of independence in 2014 before a bitter falling out with the SNP drove him to set up his own rival party. But Alba has struggled to make a political breakthrough over the years, securing just 0.5% of the vote in the 2024 general election. The contenders hoping to lead Alba into the high-stakes 2026 Scottish elections, Ash Regan and Kenny MacAskill, have sat down with Sky News as members prepare to vote. The contest has been dominated by infighting and increasingly bitter divisions. Mr MacAskill, a long-term colleague of Alex Salmond and current acting leader, is facing allegations of bullying and harassment by party general secretary Chris McEleny. The role is a paid post. \n                  Police Scotland issue facial reconstruction of mystery skull pulled from North Sea\n                 \n                  Suspect in court over Clydebank van and fireworks blaze that left 'kids screaming in sheer terror'\n                 \n                  Police Scotland investigation under way after girl, 8, targeted in sextortion plot\n                 Mr McEleny was an aide to Salmond but was suspended over claims of \"disobeying direct orders from the leadership\". Kenny MacAskill told Sky News that Alba's ruling body, in consultation with lawyers, has now sacked him. He said: \"He {Chris} has since been dismissed on gross misconduct and his membership of the party will be considered. \"The NEC has terminated his employment, and he has been notified of his dismissal for gross misconduct.\" 'Not a bully' Chris McEleny revealed he would appeal against the decision and stands by the suggestion he was the victim of bullying. \"I think Kenny is going to look back in the near future and regret some of the actions of the previous months,\" he told Sky News. \"Alex Salmond used to always tell me that in a political party rational people need to bump along with each other. \"Sadly we have not seen people bumping along with each other when either means they have not been acting rationally, or it means they are not in a position that they are fit to lead a political party.\" Asked by Sky News if he was a bully, Kenny MacAskill replied: \"No\". He added: \"Mr McEleny is causing a great deal of upset and distress to his [Salmond's] widow and to his family. I think he should cease and desist. \"At the time of Alex's death, I required to speak to him on behalf of the family because he was making comments. I had to tell him not to speak to the media in relation to the death of Alex Salmond.\" Mr MacAskill has the backing of Mr Salmond's widow, Moira, but that does not appear to be putting off rival contender Ash Regan. 'Drifting and leaderless' Ms Regan tried and failed to replace Nicola Sturgeon during the bitter SNP leadership contest in 2023 before later defecting to Mr Salmond's party. She told Sky News: \"Alba was struggling to cut through which is why I am saying we absolutely cannot continue the way we were.\" Attacking Kenny MacAskill's acting leadership of Alba, she said: \"It has allowed the party to drift. We are leaderless and it is descending in to a little bit of chaos right now.\" Polls suggest Nigel Farage's Reform party are on course to secure seats in Edinburgh next year. Questioned about whether Alba could work with Mr Farage, Ms Regan said: \"If you are asking me if I would ever go into a collation with the Reform party in a formal basis then absolutely not. \"But if you are asking me would Alba be a constructive political force in the parliament working for the things that are important for the people of Scotland, then absolutely.\" Read more from Sky News:Going For Gold presenter Henry Kelly diesRemains found in search for 2013 murder victim Asked for clarity on whether that means talking to Nigel Farage on specific issues, she replied: \"I would work with any party on a case by case basis if I felt it was the right thing for the people of Scotland.\" Kenny MacAskill ruled out any discussions with Reform under any circumstances. The winner will be announced next month in Edinburgh."

It will take close-up images of the surface to confirm it is metallic. The company then plans to land a second spacecraft on the asteroid later this year and test for platinum and other elements. If the asteroid is as rich in the metals as hoped the first mining expeditions could follow. AstroForge has developed a low-energy refining technique that it says can produce 1000kg of high-quality metal in three months. The precious cargo would then be returned to Earth. \"The cost of space has gotten so much cheaper than it's ever been,\" said Mr Gialich. \"The economics are starting to make a lot of sense. We can build and launch a really low-cost spacecraft to go take a stab at it.\" Scientists at the Natural History Museum in London have analysed the composition of meteorites that have fallen to Earth. Some have the weight and look of lumps of metal.

They are a fantastic resource for many metals.\" Mr Gialich said the time was right for rethinking the way humanity mines the resources that drive the economy. \"The way we mine today is one of the most damaging processes on Earth, right?!\" he said. \"We are destroying our planet to allow us to live in the way we live. Asteroid mining opens up a new gate to maintain our way of life, cost free.\""

In a further row back of climate targets the company has said renewable energy investment will fall by $5bn (Â£3.95bn) a year to just $1bn to $2bn (Â£790m to Â£1.58bn). Less than half that investment will go to low-carbon energy. Funding for further oil and gas extraction will grow to $10bn (Â£7.9bn) annually as the business shifts focus back to its original mission of extracting fossil fuels. The majority (70%) of the funding will go to oil with the remaining 30% funding gas projects. Money blog: BA named joint worst airline out of 19 for long-haul flights New \"major\" oil and gas projects are to start by the end of 2027 with eight to 10 more to begin by the end of 2030. The company also said it will have \"selective\" investment in biogas, biofuels and electric vehicle (EV) charging and \"capital-light partnerships\" in renewables like wind and solar. Under the tenure of old chief executive Bernard Looney, BP had dropped its 2020 goal of cutting production, revising it down in 2023 from 40% to 25%. The aim of dropping its oil and gas output by 2030 has been axed. \n                  Five years on from BP's ambitious pledge, the climate has changed in every sense\n                 \n                  'Suspected unexploded device' discovered near North Sea FLAGS pipeline\n                 \n                  Middle East conflict: Oil prices climb as violence escalates\n                 The International Energy Agency has said no new fossil fuel project is compatible with the globally accepted goal of limiting warming to 1.5C. But BP now aims to grow production to 2.3 million to 2.5 million barrels of oil a day in 2030. Why is this happening? \"Today we have fundamentally reset BP's strategy,\" chief executive Murray Auchincloss said. \"This is all in service of sustainably growing cash flow and returns.\" BP went \"too far too fast\", Mr Auchincloss said, due to \"misplaced\" optimism on the pace of energy transition and decarbonisation which was not as fast as he envisioned. This latest scaleback comes as BP faces pressure from activist investor Elliott Management, which reportedly took a 5% share of the company. Elliott is renowned for forcing changes in companies to increase the share price and was reportedly pushing for a sale of BP's renewable arm. BP's share price had dipped below the all-time high in February 2023 and company profits have come off the record level in 2022. Dividends and company performance have been lower at BP than at its energy-producing peers. The current CEO Mr Auchincloss announced plans in January to cut BP's workforce by 5% - reducing the headcount by 4,700 - as he sought to achieve $2bn (Â£1.62bn) of cost savings. It comes as the world breached the key 1.5-degree threshold in the 12 months from June 2023 to May 2024. Countries including the UK signed up to the Paris Agreement to limit global warming to the 1.5 target. There's been a sector-wide retreat from green investment, however, as US President Donald Trump pledged to \"drill baby drill\"."

His pitch was striking and very much of the moment. A multinational that began as the Anglo-Persian Oil Company in 1909 would move away from its core products, cutting annual oil production, investing in renewable energy, and even suggested leaving some of its assets in the ground, unexploited. Money blog: How much do you need to earn to be wealthy? The aim, Mr Looney said, was to make BP net-zero by 2050, and to help the world do the same, an aspiration environmental campaigners never dared to imagine they would hear from a fossil fuel giant. For all the styling, this was not an altruistic move from Mr Looney and the BP board. \n                  BP slashes renewables investment and boosts fossil fuel production\n                 \n                  'Suspected unexploded device' discovered near North Sea FLAGS pipeline\n                 \n                  Middle East conflict: Oil prices climb as violence escalates\n                 With global leaders signed up to cutting carbon emissions and consumers increasingly enthusiastic about the alternatives, they saw money in the pivot to alternative sources.  COVID, only just beginning its circumnavigation of the globe when Mr Looney got to his feet in February 2020, may have reinforced faith in his bet, as skies went quiet and commuters stayed at home. One fundamental question remained unanswered: Could BP continue to fund the dividends and return to shareholders by which markets, not activists, judge oil majors, and on which many investors depend for retirement funds to thrive? Five years on the answer is no, and the climate has changed, in every sense. Mr Looney is gone, dismissed for being a little too charismatic in undisclosed relationships with employees, and his successor, Canadian Murray Auchincloss, has seen the wind turn against his company and its chosen course. COVID was followed by the Russian invasion of Ukraine and a spike in energy prices that delivered a windfall to oil and gas majors and their shareholders. BP delivered a profit of $13.8bn but comparison with its competitors, notably Shell, is unflattering. Read more:Who's given Ukraine most aid - and does it have enough rare earth metals to 'pay back' US? Its share price has lagged as oil and gas have proved both cheaper and more profitable than wind and solar in an inflationary environment. Its debts meanwhile have grown, swollen by borrowing to fund major investments in renewables, while Shell's have been cut courtesy of post-Ukraine profits. With investor sentiment turning, accelerated by activist fund Elliott, which has built a reported 5% stake, Mr Auchincloss has slammed on the brakes. Under pressure after five quarters of unreliable revenue, profit and debt forecasts, he is taking British Petroleum back to petroleum. Back to basics The contrast with Mr Looney's strategic reset could not have been more marked. Speaking on a webcast with only a small in-person audience, the sober Mr Auchincloss stood next to a new slogan: \"Growing shareholder value\", in a mixed-case, formal typeface. His analysis was equally clear: \"In 2020 we made some bold strategic changes, accelerating into the energy transition while progressively reducing our hydrocarbon business. \"We then saw COVID, the war in Ukraine, a recession and the shift in attitudes of markets and governments have a fundamental impact on the energy system... Our optimism for a fast (energy) transition was misplaced, and we went too far, too fast.\" His alternative can be summarised as back to basics. Oil production will increase, almost to 2019 levels, and capital investment will be focused on oil and gas, 75% of it on \"upstream\" extraction, and less than 5% spent on renewables. Mr Auchincloss's case is that oil and gas will be in \"robust\" global demand until 2035, and his message to shareholders is he intends to exploit it for their benefit. No consensus Not all shareholders agree, with 48 UK investors demanding a vote on the reset, and the UK Sustainable Investment Finance Association denouncing it as a retrograde turn away from the energy of the future that could leave BP saddled with stranded assets. Coming on the same day the UK government's Climate Change Committee (CCC) painted a picture of an inexorable transition to low-carbon energy, driven by electrification of home heating, cars and industry, it is an unsentimental bet on the carbon status quo, and on short-term returns. By the 2040s, says the CCC, electric vehicles will be so ubiquitous that petrol stations will be hard to find. Mr Auchincloss appears to be banking on BP forecourts being among them."

        "Content": "\n          Science and technology editor\n              @t0mclark3\n  \"The Seventh Carbon Budget Advice for the UK government\" couldn't sound more tedious. But it is arguably the most consequential report to date for the UK's economy and, perhaps, the political fortunes of Keir Starmer's government. The UK's world-leading aim of cutting carbon emissions to zero by 2050 is colossally ambitious. And as Labour's critics gleefully point out, potentially ruinous. But what doesn't get mentioned often enough is how, without anybody really noticing, we've already done half the work needed. Our emissions are already down 50%. That was achieved by getting rid of coal and replacing an increasing share of gas-fired power generation with wind and solar power. That was far from simple - and there is a lot left to do to deliver \"the homegrown clean power\" Labour campaigned on (not mentioning the fact they, or any other government, was legally required to do it anyway). But it's cutting the remaining 50% of emissions where things get interesting. Because from here on in, the path to net zero runs right into people's homes, where billpayers and voters live. And we're going to notice it. By 2038 to 2042, the majority of homes will need to have ditched their gas boiler for a heat pump, switched to an electric car, and probably be eating a bit less meat (cleverly, the committee expert invoked kebabs as the semi-official yardstick here: meat eating must fall from the equivalent of eight kebabs a week to six by 2050. A hardship most consumers would gladly stomach - perhaps less so if it was lamb chops or steak). The advantages are multiple. EVs and heat pumps are inherently more efficient, less polluting, insulated from conflict-driven price shocks and - once you've paid for them - cheaper. And there's the rub. Because they're so much more expensive now, the challenge for a cash-strapped government is how to help consumers with the upfront costs that benefit us all in the long run. Read more:How the climate fight is coming into your homeWays the net zero push is impacting Britain's economy  Unlike similar domestic technology roll-outs that happened just as fast - the internet, fridges, mobile phones - heat pumps and EVs won't bring any immediate benefits into the home unless they are cheaper or better. To make it happen, the government needs to make electricity much cheaper, and make the savings meaningful for consumers or companies who would gladly install, for example, a heat pump for free if a customer could pay them back over the lifetime of the product through bill savings and still come out on top compared to a gas boiler. And for a government that has nailed net zero to its mast, there's more to stomach than six kebabs a week.  Critics are missing the point of net zero push The gas lobby is already seething. The committee rules out hydrogen (a potential replacement for natural gas) as a climate-credible solution. It also models making electricity cheaper by shifting the \"policy costs\" (essentially green levies and part of the warm homes levy) off the electricity part of bills where they currently sit and onto the gas part, making EVs and heat pumps immediately more affordable and gas boilers less so. Then there's the rising tide of anti-net zero sentiment from the right of British and international politics, whose message is: that saving the planet will ruin consumers, hobble the economy and is iniquitous given the UK has done so much already and we're just a small contributor to global warming. That's kind of missing the point. Even if you forget the planet, what half-credible politician could tell voters they're against newer, better technology that will ultimately make consumers and the wider economy healthier and better off? But it is understandable. Realising the benefits of new clean technologies either requires time, or higher upfront costs. We also have to trust some technologies will improve - how are we all supposed to charge our EVs at a busy bank holiday service station? Right now, though, trust, cash and - when it comes to carbon budgets - time, are in short supply."

One third of those emissions cuts will come from decisions made by households. \n                  More heat pumps, fewer kebabs - Is this the way to stop climate change?\n                 \n                  Heat pumps, EVs and fewer kebabs: You'll notice the next cut to emissions - but half the work is done\n                 \n                  How net zero push is impacting Britain's economy - including some nice salary bumps\n                 While the first stage of the country's national climate action has \"gone largely unnoticed\", the next phase will be \"a lot more difficult\", said Adam Berman from Energy UK, which represents energy suppliers. \"It's going to be technically more difficult, it is going to be much more visceral and tangible to people in their everyday lives. It affects how they get to work, what they use to heat their homes and even diet.\"  Experts say if we get it right, it will make our lives better with cleaner air and better public transport. It would also shave hundreds of pounds off annual household bills. But it depends on what the government does next to help people. Read more:Heat pumps, EVs, kebabs: You'll notice the next cut to emissions The way we travel The two \"most impactful\" things households can do are replacing their car with an electric one and a gas boiler with a heat pump (only when they pack up, and not before), the advice said. By 2040, the share of electric cars on the road needs to jump from 2.8% in 2023 to 80% in order to meet net zero, according to the recommendations, which the government is not obliged to accept. They are already \"generally\" cheaper to run than petrol or diesel cars, while the falling cost of batteries means EVs should finally cost the same upfront in the next three years. The committee's chief executive Emma Pinchbeck said: \"Frankly, by the time a lot of people are going to be choosing a new car, the electric vehicle is just going to be the cheapest [option].\" How we heat our homes But while the switch to electric vehicles is powering ahead, the move to greener home heating has barely left the starting blocks. Homes are currently the second highest-emitting sector in the UK economy, and much of that comes from the way we heat them. The CCC today put to bed calls to keep gas boilers but run them on hydrogen, recommending there be \"no role for hydrogen heating in residential buildings\". Hydrogen is hard to produce in a green way, and so would be reserved for other sectors that have no other viable alternatives. The government is yet to confirm this decision, which would dismay the gas networks and boiler manufacturers. Instead, the advisers said people should eventually replace boilers with heat pumps, which run on electricity and work a bit like a fridge in reverse: grabbing and compressing warmth from the outside air and using it to heat your home. Amid a political row over the costs of net zero, the analysis concluded these two switches could save households around Â£700 a year on heating bills and a further Â£700 on motoring costs. Cutting down on meat and on excessive flying will also play an important, but smaller role they said. The upfront investment will cost the equivalent of 0.2% of GDP, most of which would come from the private sector. Overcoming the costs But at the moment the benefits of these green switches are not spread fairly, and some people can't access them at all. The upfront costs of a heat pump - and home upgrades needed alongside - are \"sizeable\" and price out poorer households, even with current government subsidies, campaigners and the CCC said. Zachary Leather, an economist at the Resolution Foundation thinktank, said: \"While politicians fret and argue about the cost of net zero, today's report shows that there are long-term benefits for consumers and the environment.\" But the government needs to \"get serious\" about helping lower-income households to adopt heat pumps and EVs so they can save money too, he said. Meanwhile, it is still cheaper for someone with a driveway to charge their EV than someone who charges theirs on the street - and electricity prices overall should be made cheaper to help people reap the benefits. Mr Berman from Energy UK said: \"All through the energy system there are these small examples that tend to mean working class households find it more expensive to take up low carbon alternatives.\"  The energy transition is 'not fair yet' It also comes at a time of wavering support for climate action. While Labour was elected on a mandate to go faster on climate action, the Conservatives have retreated from green issues, and Reform UK wants to dismantle net zero altogether. Mr Berman said a way to \"resolve that question of public consent is to ensure we're rolling out that infrastructure in a really, really fair and inclusive way. And we're not there yet\". The public are also confused about if, when and how to switch to these green technologies, and which government should tackle this with clearer guidance, the CCC said. Energy Secretary Ed Miliband said: \"This advice is independent of government policy, and we will now consider it and respond in due course. \"It is clear that the best route to making Britain energy secure, bringing down bills and creating jobs is by embracing the clean energy transition. This government's clean energy superpower mission is about doing so in a way that grows our economy and makes working people better off. \"We owe it to current generations to seize the opportunities for energy security and lower bills, and we owe it to future generations to tackle the existential climate crisis.\""

        "Content": "Apple says it is repairing a glitch with its speech-to-text feature on iPhones which interprets the word \"racist\" as \"Trump\" before autocorrecting itself. The US technology giant said it is working on fixing the bug which has triggered outrage from Trump supporters and conservative commentators, including Infowars host and conspiracy theorist Alex Jones. iPhone users have been posting videos on social media testing out the glitch.   Sky News' US partner NBC News was able to replicate the same trend on multiple iPhone devices. However, not all tests resulted in the glitch. When activating its voice dictation feature and saying the word \"racist\" the text result would briefly display \"Trump\" before being replaced with \"racist\". \"We are aware of an issue with the speech recognition model that powers dictation and we are rolling out a fix today,\" a spokesperson for Apple said in a statement on Tuesday. Apple explained the speech recognition models powering the feature may first display words with some phonetic overlap.  Then further analysis enables it to land on the actual word that the user intended to say. The tech company said the bug has been incorrectly suggesting \"Trump\" in response to several words that include an \"r\" consonant.

        "Content": " Gossip Girl and Buffy The Vampire actress Michelle Trachtenberg has died aged 39. The actress was found dead at her home in New York City after officers responded to a 911 call just after 8am local time this morning. An investigation into her death has been opened but \"criminality is not suspected\", police said. \"The family requests privacy for their loss,\" Trachtenberg's representative, Gary Mantoosh, said in a statement on Wednesday. Trachtenberg was best known for her role as Dawn Summers in Buffy, the younger sister of the title character played by Sarah Michelle Gellar between 2000 and 2003. Between 2008 and 2012, she played Georgina Sparks on Gossip Girl - the malevolent rival of Blake Lively's Serena van der Woodsen and Leighton Meester's Blair Waldorf. \"We are deeply saddened by the news of Michelle's passing. Michelle was so funny, kind, and talented,\" said a joint statement of \"Gossip Girl\" creators Josh Schwartz and Stephanie Savage. \"Her portrayal of Georgina Sparks was an iconic fan favourite, and grew from a one-season villain to a beloved character who returned over the course of six seasons. She was a delight to have on set and will be deeply missed. Our thoughts are with her family.\" She also starred in the movie 17 Again, where she portrayed daughter Maggie O'Donnell, comedy film Eurotrip and the 2005 teen film Ice Princess. Kim Cattrall, who played rink owner and figure skater Tina Harwood in Ice Princess, posted a picture of herself and Trachtenberg from that movie. Trachtenberg thanked Gellar for speaking out against Joss Whedon in 2021, following abuse allegations made against the Buffy showrunner. \"I am brave enough now as a 35-year-old woman to repost this,\" she wrote on social media, and alluded to \"his not appropriate behaviour\" she experienced as a teenage actor. In response to claims on the set of Buffy, Mr Whedon told Vulture that he was not as \"civilised\" as he was now and admitted yelling at the cast - but dismissed several other claims. Meanwhile, her co-star on Gossip Girl Ed Westwick said in an Instagram Story that he was \"so sad to hear of the passing of Michelle Trachtenberg sending prayers\". Buffy the Vampire Slayer co-star David Boreanaz said on Instagram it was \"so very sad.. horrible news\". Trachtenberg's first big break into Hollywood came in 1996, starring in the big screen adaptation of Harriet the Spy. In 2001, she received a Daytime Emmy nomination for hosting Discovery's Truth or Scare. Her most recent film appearance came last year when she played the role of Michelle Cody White in Spyral. Trachtenberg posted on social media in recent months to tell fans she was OK despite concerns that she appeared frail. She responded to one commenter: \"Did you lose a calendar and not realise I'm not 14. I'm 38.\""

He was a presenter on the ITV entertainment show Game For A Laugh from 1981 - and went on to host BBC One game show Going For Gold for 10 seasons from the late 1980s to the mid-1990s. The original show saw people from different countries competing against each other for a cash prize through answering questions. The show's theme tune was composed by future multi-award winning composer Hans Zimmer. The show was revived by Channel 5, featuring contestants from the UK and Ireland only, with newsreader John Suchet at the helm. Kelly also appeared in Victoria Wood sitcom Dinnerladies, had a stint on morning programme TV-am, and talk show After Dark. He was a founding presenter on Classic FM where he hosted a daily breakfast show from 1992 to 2003 - and won a Sony Radio Award in 1994 when he was voted national broadcaster of the year. His later radio career saw him have the Henry Kelly Show on LBC for a while, as well as present on BBC Radio Berkshire from 2005 to 2015. He also wrote books including the 1972 work How Stormont Fell, about the events which hit the Northern Irish parliament, and he co-authored the 1990s collection Classic FM Musical Anecdotes, Notes And Quotes with John Foley."

The failed festival in 2017 hit headlines after charging guests up to $100,000 per head to travel to the island of Great Exuma in the Bahamas, but failing to deliver the white sands, luxury accommodation and first-class food that was promised. It even led to co-organiser Billy McFarland serving nearly four years of a six-year prison sentence after he pleaded guilty to wire fraud charges relating to the festival and various fraud charges stemming from a separate ticket-selling scam.

Relaunching the festival, Mr McFarland told Sky News' US partner NBC News that Fyre II is \"not about the past\" but about \"taking the vision, which is strong\". Unlike the original festival, Fyre said in a statement that live event organiser Lostnights has signed up to handle the details, along with hotel, travel and ticketing companies also coming on board to help plan and organise the event. One thing that has not changed is ticket costs, with prices ranging from $1,400 (Â£1,100) to an eye watering $1.1m (Â£869,000). The website states that the top-tier ticket - named the Prometheus package - gets eight people into the festival as well as the option to stay on a yacht, have a 24/7 private chauffeur, access to one of the stages as well as exclusive \"additional experiences\". \"You will be on a boat, have the luxury yachts that we partner with who will be docked and parked outside the island,\" Mr McFarland told NBC's Today show. \"But once again, Fyre is not just about this, like, luxury experience,\" he added. \"It's about the adventure. So you'll be scuba diving with me. You'll be bouncing around to other islands and other countries on small planes.\" Mr McFarland has also promised performances from a number of artists across the electronic, hip hop, pop and rock genres. But no artists are yet to be announced to be taking part. \"It's not just music. We might have a professional skateboarder do a demonstration. We might have an MMA champion teach you techniques in the morning,\" he said. 'There is a risk component to it' The disaster of the first Fyre festival became the focus of the Netflix series FYRE: The Greatest Party That Never Happened in 2019. It portrayed stranded guests who were faced to battle for a limited number of tents, had issues with access to water, and instead of gourmet meals, were served limp cheese sandwiches in Styrofoam boxes, a photo of which went viral on social media at the time. When asked if there was a risk to buying a ticket to the second attempt at the festival, Mr McFarland told Today: \"Until it's experienced, there is a risk component to it.\" \"You're taking a risk because I made a lot of bad decisions and messed up the first festival,\" he said. \"Since 2016, Fyre has been the most talked about music festival in the world. Obviously, a lot of that has been negative, but I think that most people, once they kind of get under the hood and study the plans and see the team behind Fyre II, they see the upside.\" Read more from Sky News:Going For Gold presenter Henry Kelly diesBiggest crypto heist in history He said if the festival is a success, he thinks it has the chance to be an annual event.

        "Content": "\n          News reporter\n              @SunnyNadal\n  Donald Trump has shared a bizarre AI-generated video on his Truth Social platform showcasing what appears to be a vision of Gaza under his proposed plan. The footage, which the 78-year-old shared without comment, shows the war-ravaged territory before a caption appears: \"Gaza 2025... What's Next?\" It then goes on to show the area transformed into a Middle Eastern paradise with exotic beaches, Dubai-style skyscrapers, luxury yachts and people partying. It includes a \"Trump Gaza\" tower and a gigantic, golden statue of the US president - with miniature versions on sale in a souvenir gift shop. A child is also shown walking in a street, holding a huge, golden balloon of the president's head. The video also features the world leader dancing with a scantily clad belly dancer in a bar - and sunbathing and sipping cocktails by a hotel resort pool with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Elon Musk appears in the footage several times - sitting on a beach eating humous with flatbreads as bearded belly dancers perform on the sand. The billionaire boss of X, Tesla and SpaceX - who also leads the US Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) which has been tasked with cutting government spending - is also shown throwing dollar bills in the air for people. A song written for the video also plays in the background. The lyrics go: \"Donald's coming to set you free, bringing the light for all to see, no more tunnels, no more fear: Trump Gaza's finally here. \"Trump Gaza's shining bright, golden future, a brand new life. \"Feast and dance the deal is done, Trump Gaza number one.\" Sky News has established the video was first shared online in early February by accounts with no apparent connection to the White House. International correspondent Doing the job of a glossy brochure, this video is trying to sell a proposal Donald Trump sketched out several weeks ago. Gaza is \"a demolition site\" he said, that the US would \"take over\" and \"own\".\nÂ  Once it has been levelled, the US president will then construct \"the Riviera of the Mediterranean\". The enclave's 2.3 million residents would be resettled in Jordan or Egypt. \"We just clear out the whole thing,\" says Trump. The legal, ethical and practical challenges associated with this concept are too numerous to mention here - and it was noteworthy that members of his team, like secretary of state Marco Rubio, seemed to row back on the 'Riviera' after its launch. But Trump has not given up on his vision. In the absence of a genuine plan for Gaza's future governance â€“ and the current ceasefire deal has not produced anything that looks like a plan - the US president's invention looks like the only thing sitting on the table.Â  What about the naysayers then â€“ the lawyers, the human rights people and the Palestinians living on this \"demolition site\"? Well, the video is not going to change their minds. Ultimately, this 35-second spectacular is designed to please the president himself. In the virtual world, Trump has already fixed an issue that has bedevilled world leaders since the 1920s. All we have to do, is accept it. Read more from Sky News:Large bruise on Trump's hand prompts speculation over healthWhat you need to know about Trump's Gaza plan Mr Trump announced his plan - for when the war between Israel and Hamas ends - earlier this year. It includes relocating two million Gazans to neighbouring Arab countries and developing the territory into the \"Riviera of the Middle East\". He described Gaza as a \"demolition site\" where \"virtually every building is down\". Laying out his idea of what would happen beyond an Israel-Hamas ceasefire, he proposed: \"The US will take over the Gaza Strip and we will do a job with it too.\" He said America would be \"responsible for dismantling all of the dangerous unexploded bombs and other weapons on the site\", before it would \"get rid of the destroyed buildings\", and \"level it out\". \"Everybody I've spoken to loves the idea of the United States owning that piece of land, developing and creating thousands of jobs,\" he added. The White House described the proposal as \"out-of-the-box\" and \"visionary\" - but it was condemned as the effective \"ethnic cleansing\" of Palestinians from Gaza. Hamas described the proposals as \"ridiculous and absurd\" in a statement from one of its officials. Egypt, Jordan, and Saudi Arabia, which as fellow Arab nations support the Palestinian cause, also rejected Mr Trump's plan.

He added: \"This is terrifying, we still don't [know] if we are going to stay here or not... we don't know what's happening tomorrow. \"This is terrifying and this is terrible.\" Meanwhile, there was a mixed reaction to the video in the comments section below it. One person wrote: \"I don't think that's funny or cool. Sorry. Am I missing something??? I hope it's a joke a bad joke..\" \"I hate this. I love our president, but this is horrible,\" said another. One Truth Social user wrote: \"Mr President while I appreciate what you do, is not about you. To God be the glory and the honor, for without Him, you couldn't have accomplished anything. The statue is a symbol of the antichrist, please humble yourself to God. Jesus is king and only Him.\" \"You're doing great Mr President. But don't let it get to your head. God put you in that position for His Glory, not yours,\" said another. \"Can we transform our US cities to look like this 2025 vision first? Our cities are dumps with ugly buildings and homeless people,\" wrote one user. \"Everything looks good, just stay away from these guys,\" said another, reposting a screenshot of the bearded belly dancers."
