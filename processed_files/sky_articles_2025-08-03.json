        "Content": " Martin Lewis says motorists who were mis-sold car finance are likely to receive \"hundreds, not thousands of pounds\" - with regulators launching a consultation on a new compensation scheme. The founder of MoneySavingExpert.com believes it is \"very likely\" that about 40% of Britons who entered personal contact purchase or hire purchase agreements between 2007 and 2021 will be eligible for payouts. \"Discretionary commission arrangements\" saw brokers and dealers charge higher levels of interest so they could receive more commission, without telling consumers. Speaking to Sky News Radio's Faye Rowlands, Lewis said: \"Very rarely will it be thousands of pounds unless you have more than one car finance deal. \"So up to about a maximum of £950 per car finance deal where you are due compensation.\" Lewis explained that consumers who believe they may have been affected should check whether they had a discretionary commission arrangement by writing to their car finance company. However, the personal finance guru warned against using a claims firm. \n                  I'm a priest - I don't get paid a salary but I do get a house\n                 \n                  Spending review: More cash for schools, NHS and defence expected as chancellor unveils plans\n                 \n                  Holiday coming up? Here's how data roaming charges compare by network\n                 \"They're hardly going to do anything for you and you might get the money paid to you automatically anyway, in which case you're giving them 30% for nothing,\" he added. Read more: How to tell if you've been mis-sold car finance  Yesterday, the Financial Conduct Authority said its review of the past use of motor finance \"has shown that many firms were not complying with the law or our disclosure rules that were in force when they sold loans to consumers\". The FCA's statement added that those affected \"should be appropriately compensated in an orderly, consistent and efficient way\". Lewis told Sky News that the consultation will launch in October - and will take six weeks. \"We expect payouts to come in 2026, assuming this will happen and it's very likely to happen,\" he said. \"As for exactly how will work, it hasn't decided yet. Firms will have to contact people, although there is an issue about them having destroyed some of the data for older claims.\" He believes claims will either be paid automatically - or affected consumers will need to opt in and apply to get compensation back.

Anyone who has already complained does not need to do anything.  The authority added: \"Consumers concerned that they were not told about commission, and who think they may have paid too much for the finance, should complain now\".  Its website advises drivers to complain to their finance provider first. \n\n If you're unhappy with the response, you can then contact the Financial Ombudsman. Any compensation scheme will be easy to participate in, without drivers needing to use a claims management company or law firm. The FCA has warned motorists that doing so could end up costing you 30% of any compensation in fees.  The FCA estimates the cost of any scheme - including compensation and administrative costs - to be no lower than £9bn. But in a video on X, Lewis said that millions of people are likely to be due a share of up to £18bn. The regulator's announcement comes after the Supreme Court ruled on a separate, but similar, case on Friday."

        "Content": " Hamas has said it is ready to cooperate with a request to deliver food to Israeli hostages in Gaza, if Israel agrees to permanently open a humanitarian corridor into the enclave. The militant group's statement comes amid international outcry over two videos it released of Israeli hostage Evyatar David, who it has held captive since 7 October 2023. The now 24-year-old looks skeletal, with his shoulder blades protruding from his back. The footage sparked huge criticism, with EU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas labelling the videos \"appalling\" - and saying they \"expose the barbarity of Hamas\". More than 100 journalists, photographers and war correspondents have signed a petition demanding \"immediate and unsupervised foreign press access to the Gaza Strip\". Signatories include Sky News' special correspondent Alex Crawford. They are renewing calls for both Israel and Hamas to allow foreign journalists into Gaza to report independently on the war, something they have been barred from doing since the start of the latest conflict in 2023. The petition goes further to say if \"belligerent parties\" ignore the appeal, media professionals will be supported to enter Gaza without consent \"by any legitimate means, independently, collectively, or in coordination with humanitarian or civil society actors\". Read the full story here. Yesterday, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said he had asked the Red Cross to give humanitarian assistance to the hostages. Hamas's military spokesperson Abu Obeidah said it is \"ready to engage positively and respond to any request from the Red Cross to bring food and medicine to enemy captives\". But he warned certain conditions must be met - including Israel permanently opening a humanitarian corridor, and halting airstrikes when aid is distributed. Gaza's health ministry has said that six more people have died of starvation or malnutrition in the enclave in the past 24 hours - increasing the total to 175 since the war began, including 93 children. Multiple international agencies have warned that famine is unfolding across the territory.  No aid entered Gaza between 2 March and 19 May due an Israeli blockade - and deliveries of supplies including food, medicine and fuel have been limited since then. Israeli authorities have previously said there is \"no famine caused by Israel\" - and that its military is \"working to facilitate and ease the distribution of humanitarian aid in the Gaza Strip\". Meanwhile, Palestinian health authorities also said at least 80 people in Gaza were killed by Israeli gunfire and airstrikes yesterday. These included people trying to access aid, medics on the ground said. The Israel Defence Forces (IDF) has repeatedly said it \"categorically rejects the claims of intentional harm to civilians\", and has previously blamed Hamas militants for fomenting chaos and endangering Gazans.

Of those, they still hold approximately 50 hostages - with 20 believed to be alive - after most of the others were released in ceasefires or other deals. Israel's retaliatory offensive has killed more than 60,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry, which does not differentiate between militants and civilians in its count."

        "Content": "\n          News correspondent\n              @ashnahurynag\n  Almost two months after Air India Flight 171's deadly crash, some of the 53 British nationals on board are only now being laid to rest. Some 300 friends, families, and locals from the Gujarati community in and around London gathered in Wembley for a prayer and memorial service dedicated to remembering some of the victims. Wearing his father's emerald ring that was miraculously recovered from the wreckage, Miten Patel addresses the crowd. His parents, Ashok and Shobhana Patel, were travelling back to their home in Orpington, Kent, after a spiritual trip to India, when they were killed in the crash on 12 June. Their funeral was held only days ago, after being delayed following the discovery that the remains of other individuals were found in Miten's mother's casket. He credits Professor Fiona Wilcox, the senior coroner at Inner West London Coroner's Court, for meeting with him and his family to break the news. \"My parents were the first ones repatriated in the UK,\" Miten explains - he organised the repatriation of his parents before he flew out to Ahmedabad. \"When they were back home, the first thing that they did was a CT scan. And that's when it came about, the CT scan showed that with mum's remains, there were further remains there too. \"I don't know what they were. I don't know how many.\" Miten's parents' funeral was attended by hundreds. His father, Ashok, was a financial adviser and his mother, Shobhana, was a retired microbiologist. As the eldest son, organising much of his parents' farewell fell to him. The concern around his mother's remains delayed the family's chance to grieve. \"I think there should be a level of responsibility taken. Why did that happen? Where was the flaw in that process? I mean I do understand that whole situation, people were rushing, people were very tired. \"You know, to get all the remains, then having to separate them by DNA, it's a long process. But really, for us as loved ones, it is very upsetting.\" Indian government spokesman Randhir Jaiswal previously said the country was \"working closely with the UK side from the moment these concerns and issues were brought to our attention\". \"In the wake of the tragic crash, the concerned authorities had carried out identification of victims as per established protocols and technical requirements,\" he said. \"All mortal remains were handled with utmost professionalism and with due regard for the dignity of the deceased. \"We are continuing to work with the UK authorities on addressing any concerns related to this issue.\" The flight crashed moments after take-off en route to Gatwick, killing 241 people on board. Horrifying images were beamed around the world within minutes. Confusion and fear spread like wildfire among relatives back in the UK, who immediately tried to get hold of their loved ones.

There was only one flight out of Ahmedabad back to London that day, and she had only just been texting her brother Sunny and his wife Monali, who'd been on holiday. The events of the past few weeks have been unfathomable. In her first interview about her brother and her sister-in-law, Komal explains how she flew out to India with her cousin Jina to go and identify her little brother. \"Because we weren't really allowed to see the body, I don't think I've really come to terms with it. I still think I'm dreaming and it's not really real,\" Komal tells us. Sunny and Monali Patel were in their 30s and about to celebrate their 10-year anniversary. The couple were the \"light\" and \"soul\" of their families. They loved having fun, playing with their nieces and nephews and adored travelling. Komal says her brother loved barbecues and her sister-in-law worked with children and adored hers too. \"They're just really fun, exciting, really lived life, just made memories, just made everyone really happy,\" says big sister Komal. \"They were like the heart of my kids. Whenever they walked into a room, they just filled up the room with laughter and happiness.\" The couple had been due to fly back home to London a week beforehand but postponed their flight. \"It has just been very traumatic, very, very sad for us, losing Sunny and Monali at 39 years old,\" says their cousin Jina. \"They were full of life and brought so much light into our family. As a family, we're devastated at why two people so young, with so much energy, who brought so much into our families have just sort of gone in one day.\" Read more from Ashna Hurynag:Attacker told man stabbed in sword rampage: 'I'm going to kill you'Daughter's 'painful' last memory of mum stabbed at carnival A joint funeral for the husband and wife was held a fortnight ago and like hundreds of families impacted by this tragedy, the family are now rebuilding a foundation that has been shattered."

He was sadly pronounced dead at the scene.\" According to media reports, the man fell from the stadium's upper tier. A concertgoer on social media said they saw the incident and described it as \"horrific\". Metropolitan Police said: \"The stadium was busy, and we believe it is likely a number of people witnessed the incident, or may knowingly or unknowingly have caught it on mobile phone video footage. \"If you have any information that could help us to confirm what happened, please call 101.\" Oasis performed at the venue as planned on Sunday night, delivering the final concert of a five-night run at Wembley. Addressing fans at the stadium, singer Liam said: \"This one's for all the people who can't be here tonight, but who are here if you know what I mean, and aren't they looking lovely.

        "Content": "The government has vowed to push for a \"major new crackdown\" on people smuggling gangs with a £100m cash boost for border security. The investment will support the pilot of the new \"one in, one out\" returns agreement between the UK and France, and other efforts to crack down on small boat crossings. Home Secretary Yvette Cooper said this new funding will \"strengthen\" the government's \"serious and comprehensive plan\" to dismantle the business model of criminal gangs smuggling migrants across the Channel. But the Conservatives have claimed the cash injection will make \"no real difference\", with shadow home secretary Chris Philp branding the move a Labour \"gimmick\" and a \"desperate grab for headlines\".  The funding will pay for up to 300 new National Crime Agency (NCA) officials, \"state-of-the art\" detection technology and new equipment to \"smash the networks putting lives at risk in the Channel\", ministers say. It will also allow the Border Security Command, the NCA, the police and other law enforcement agency partners to \"strengthen investigations targeting smuggling kingpins and disrupt their operations across Europe, the Middle East, Africa and beyond\".  The new investment comes as official figures show more than 25,000 people have arrived on small boats so far in 2025 - a record for this point in the year. Ms Cooper said: \"In the last 12 months, we have set the foundations for this new and much stronger law enforcement approach - establishing the new Border Security Command, strengthening the National Crime Agency and UK police operations, increasing Immigration Enforcement, introducing new counter terror style powers in our Border Security Bill, and establishing cooperation agreements with Europol and other countries. \"Now this additional funding will strengthen every aspect of our plan, and will turbo-charge the ability of our law enforcement agencies to track the gangs and bring them down, working with our partners overseas, and using state-of-the-art technology and equipment. \"Alongside our new agreements with France, this will help us drive forward our Plan for Change commitments to protect the UK's border security and restore order to our immigration system.\" Read more UK news:Inside prison doing family visits differentlyUK's most wanted man on run for 20 yearsCouple relive watching hours of riot chaos The £100m investment will also support new powers to be introduced when the Border Security, Asylum and Immigration Bill becomes law, the Home Office said. This includes the introduction of a UK-wide offence to criminalise the creation and publication of online material that promotes a breach of immigration law, such as the advertisement of small boat crossings on social media.  Research suggests about 80% of migrants arriving to the UK by small boat used internet platforms during their journey - including to contact agents linked to smuggling gangs. While it is already illegal to assist illegal immigration, ministers hope the creation of a new offence will give police more powers and disrupt business models. Mr Philp accused the Labour government of having \"no serious plan, just excuses, while ruthless criminal gangs flood our borders with illegal immigrants\". He said: \"The British public deserves real action, not empty slogans and tinkering at the edges.\""

As much as 40cm (16 inches) of snow fell in northern parts of New South Wales on Saturday, the most since the mid-1980s, Miriam Bradbury, a meteorologist at Australia's weather bureau, said. She said parts of neighbouring state Queensland also saw snow for the first time in 10 years. The New South Wales State Emergency Service said unprecedented snow, coupled with heavy rain and thunderstorms in other parts of the state, has led to more than 1,455 incidents over the weekend. This included more than 100 vehicles being stranded on major roads and tens of thousands of homes losing power. A multi-agency search is also under way for a 26-year-old woman who was swept away in floodwaters in the Hunter Valley region, after the driver of a car she was in tried to travel through floodwater, New South Wales Police said. The driver of the car, a 27-year-old woman, was rescued without any injuries. The search is due to continue on Monday, the force said.

        "Content": " Martin Lewis says motorists who were mis-sold car finance are likely to receive \"hundreds, not thousands of pounds\" - with regulators launching a consultation on a new compensation scheme. The founder of MoneySavingExpert.com believes it is \"very likely\" that about 40% of Britons who entered personal contact purchase or hire purchase agreements between 2007 and 2021 will be eligible for payouts. \"Discretionary commission arrangements\" saw brokers and dealers charge higher levels of interest so they could receive more commission, without telling consumers. Speaking to Sky News Radio's Faye Rowlands, Lewis said: \"Very rarely will it be thousands of pounds unless you have more than one car finance deal. \"So up to about a maximum of £950 per car finance deal where you are due compensation.\" Lewis explained that consumers who believe they may have been affected should check whether they had a discretionary commission arrangement by writing to their car finance company. However, the personal finance guru warned against using a claims firm. \n                  I'm a priest - I don't get paid a salary but I do get a house\n                 \n                  Spending review: More cash for schools, NHS and defence expected as chancellor unveils plans\n                 \n                  Holiday coming up? Here's how data roaming charges compare by network\n                 \"They're hardly going to do anything for you and you might get the money paid to you automatically anyway, in which case you're giving them 30% for nothing,\" he added. Read more: How to tell if you've been mis-sold car finance  Yesterday, the Financial Conduct Authority said its review of the past use of motor finance \"has shown that many firms were not complying with the law or our disclosure rules that were in force when they sold loans to consumers\". The FCA's statement added that those affected \"should be appropriately compensated in an orderly, consistent and efficient way\". Lewis told Sky News that the consultation will launch in October - and will take six weeks. \"We expect payouts to come in 2026, assuming this will happen and it's very likely to happen,\" he said. \"As for exactly how will work, it hasn't decided yet. Firms will have to contact people, although there is an issue about them having destroyed some of the data for older claims.\" He believes claims will either be paid automatically - or affected consumers will need to opt in and apply to get compensation back. Read more from Sky News:Hamas 'ready' to deliver aid to hostagesOasis 'saddened' after man dies at concert The FCA says you may be affected if you bought a car under a finance scheme, including hire purchase agreements, before 28 January 2021. Anyone who has already complained does not need to do anything.  The authority added: \"Consumers concerned that they were not told about commission, and who think they may have paid too much for the finance, should complain now\".  Its website advises drivers to complain to their finance provider first. \n\n If you're unhappy with the response, you can then contact the Financial Ombudsman. Any compensation scheme will be easy to participate in, without drivers needing to use a claims management company or law firm. The FCA has warned motorists that doing so could end up costing you 30% of any compensation in fees.  The FCA estimates the cost of any scheme - including compensation and administrative costs - to be no lower than £9bn. But in a video on X, Lewis said that millions of people are likely to be due a share of up to £18bn. The regulator's announcement comes after the Supreme Court ruled on a separate, but similar, case on Friday."

        "Content": "\n          News correspondent\n              @ashnahurynag\n  Almost two months after Air India Flight 171's deadly crash, some of the 53 British nationals on board are only now being laid to rest. Some 300 friends, families, and locals from the Gujarati community in and around London gathered in Wembley for a prayer and memorial service dedicated to remembering some of the victims. Wearing his father's emerald ring that was miraculously recovered from the wreckage, Miten Patel addresses the crowd. His parents, Ashok and Shobhana Patel, were travelling back to their home in Orpington, Kent, after a spiritual trip to India, when they were killed in the crash on 12 June. Their funeral was held only days ago, after being delayed following the discovery that the remains of other individuals were found in Miten's mother's casket. He credits Professor Fiona Wilcox, the senior coroner at Inner West London Coroner's Court, for meeting with him and his family to break the news. \"My parents were the first ones repatriated in the UK,\" Miten explains - he organised the repatriation of his parents before he flew out to Ahmedabad. \"When they were back home, the first thing that they did was a CT scan. And that's when it came about, the CT scan showed that with mum's remains, there were further remains there too. \"I don't know what they were. I don't know how many.\" Miten's parents' funeral was attended by hundreds. His father, Ashok, was a financial adviser and his mother, Shobhana, was a retired microbiologist. As the eldest son, organising much of his parents' farewell fell to him. The concern around his mother's remains delayed the family's chance to grieve. \"I think there should be a level of responsibility taken. Why did that happen? Where was the flaw in that process? I mean I do understand that whole situation, people were rushing, people were very tired. \"You know, to get all the remains, then having to separate them by DNA, it's a long process. But really, for us as loved ones, it is very upsetting.\" Indian government spokesman Randhir Jaiswal previously said the country was \"working closely with the UK side from the moment these concerns and issues were brought to our attention\". \"In the wake of the tragic crash, the concerned authorities had carried out identification of victims as per established protocols and technical requirements,\" he said. \"All mortal remains were handled with utmost professionalism and with due regard for the dignity of the deceased. \"We are continuing to work with the UK authorities on addressing any concerns related to this issue.\" The flight crashed moments after take-off en route to Gatwick, killing 241 people on board. Horrifying images were beamed around the world within minutes. Confusion and fear spread like wildfire among relatives back in the UK, who immediately tried to get hold of their loved ones.

There was only one flight out of Ahmedabad back to London that day, and she had only just been texting her brother Sunny and his wife Monali, who'd been on holiday. The events of the past few weeks have been unfathomable. In her first interview about her brother and her sister-in-law, Komal explains how she flew out to India with her cousin Jina to go and identify her little brother. \"Because we weren't really allowed to see the body, I don't think I've really come to terms with it. I still think I'm dreaming and it's not really real,\" Komal tells us. Sunny and Monali Patel were in their 30s and about to celebrate their 10-year anniversary. The couple were the \"light\" and \"soul\" of their families. They loved having fun, playing with their nieces and nephews and adored travelling. Komal says her brother loved barbecues and her sister-in-law worked with children and adored hers too. \"They're just really fun, exciting, really lived life, just made memories, just made everyone really happy,\" says big sister Komal. \"They were like the heart of my kids. Whenever they walked into a room, they just filled up the room with laughter and happiness.\" The couple had been due to fly back home to London a week beforehand but postponed their flight. \"It has just been very traumatic, very, very sad for us, losing Sunny and Monali at 39 years old,\" says their cousin Jina. \"They were full of life and brought so much light into our family. As a family, we're devastated at why two people so young, with so much energy, who brought so much into our families have just sort of gone in one day.\" Read more from Ashna Hurynag:Attacker told man stabbed in sword rampage: 'I'm going to kill you'Daughter's 'painful' last memory of mum stabbed at carnival A joint funeral for the husband and wife was held a fortnight ago and like hundreds of families impacted by this tragedy, the family are now rebuilding a foundation that has been shattered."

        "Content": "The government has vowed to push for a \"major new crackdown\" on people smuggling gangs with a £100m cash boost for border security. The investment will support the pilot of the new \"one in, one out\" returns agreement between the UK and France, and other efforts to crack down on small boat crossings. Home Secretary Yvette Cooper said this new funding will \"strengthen\" the government's \"serious and comprehensive plan\" to dismantle the business model of criminal gangs smuggling migrants across the Channel. But the Conservatives have claimed the cash injection will make \"no real difference\", with shadow home secretary Chris Philp branding the move a Labour \"gimmick\" and a \"desperate grab for headlines\".  The funding will pay for up to 300 new National Crime Agency (NCA) officials, \"state-of-the art\" detection technology and new equipment to \"smash the networks putting lives at risk in the Channel\", ministers say. It will also allow the Border Security Command, the NCA, the police and other law enforcement agency partners to \"strengthen investigations targeting smuggling kingpins and disrupt their operations across Europe, the Middle East, Africa and beyond\".  The new investment comes as official figures show more than 25,000 people have arrived on small boats so far in 2025 - a record for this point in the year. Ms Cooper said: \"In the last 12 months, we have set the foundations for this new and much stronger law enforcement approach - establishing the new Border Security Command, strengthening the National Crime Agency and UK police operations, increasing Immigration Enforcement, introducing new counter terror style powers in our Border Security Bill, and establishing cooperation agreements with Europol and other countries. \"Now this additional funding will strengthen every aspect of our plan, and will turbo-charge the ability of our law enforcement agencies to track the gangs and bring them down, working with our partners overseas, and using state-of-the-art technology and equipment. \"Alongside our new agreements with France, this will help us drive forward our Plan for Change commitments to protect the UK's border security and restore order to our immigration system.\" Read more UK news:Inside prison doing family visits differentlyUK's most wanted man on run for 20 yearsCouple relive watching hours of riot chaos The £100m investment will also support new powers to be introduced when the Border Security, Asylum and Immigration Bill becomes law, the Home Office said. This includes the introduction of a UK-wide offence to criminalise the creation and publication of online material that promotes a breach of immigration law, such as the advertisement of small boat crossings on social media.  Research suggests about 80% of migrants arriving to the UK by small boat used internet platforms during their journey - including to contact agents linked to smuggling gangs. While it is already illegal to assist illegal immigration, ministers hope the creation of a new offence will give police more powers and disrupt business models. Mr Philp accused the Labour government of having \"no serious plan, just excuses, while ruthless criminal gangs flood our borders with illegal immigrants\". He said: \"The British public deserves real action, not empty slogans and tinkering at the edges.\""

The broadcaster is said to have hired an external law firm to probe the drug-taking allegations, which a source said were \"well-known\" on the show, The Sun on Sunday reports.

        "Content": " Hamas has said it is ready to cooperate with a request to deliver food to Israeli hostages in Gaza, if Israel agrees to permanently open a humanitarian corridor into the enclave. The militant group's statement comes amid international outcry over two videos it released of Israeli hostage Evyatar David, who it has held captive since 7 October 2023. The now 24-year-old looks skeletal, with his shoulder blades protruding from his back. The footage sparked huge criticism, with EU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas labelling the videos \"appalling\" - and saying they \"expose the barbarity of Hamas\". More than 100 journalists, photographers and war correspondents have signed a petition demanding \"immediate and unsupervised foreign press access to the Gaza Strip\". Signatories include Sky News' special correspondent Alex Crawford. They are renewing calls for both Israel and Hamas to allow foreign journalists into Gaza to report independently on the war, something they have been barred from doing since the start of the latest conflict in 2023. The petition goes further to say if \"belligerent parties\" ignore the appeal, media professionals will be supported to enter Gaza without consent \"by any legitimate means, independently, collectively, or in coordination with humanitarian or civil society actors\". Read the full story here. Yesterday, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said he had asked the Red Cross to give humanitarian assistance to the hostages. Hamas's military spokesperson Abu Obeidah said it is \"ready to engage positively and respond to any request from the Red Cross to bring food and medicine to enemy captives\". But he warned certain conditions must be met - including Israel permanently opening a humanitarian corridor, and halting airstrikes when aid is distributed. Gaza's health ministry has said that six more people have died of starvation or malnutrition in the enclave in the past 24 hours - increasing the total to 175 since the war began, including 93 children. Multiple international agencies have warned that famine is unfolding across the territory.  No aid entered Gaza between 2 March and 19 May due an Israeli blockade - and deliveries of supplies including food, medicine and fuel have been limited since then. Israeli authorities have previously said there is \"no famine caused by Israel\" - and that its military is \"working to facilitate and ease the distribution of humanitarian aid in the Gaza Strip\". Meanwhile, Palestinian health authorities also said at least 80 people in Gaza were killed by Israeli gunfire and airstrikes yesterday. These included people trying to access aid, medics on the ground said. The Israel Defence Forces (IDF) has repeatedly said it \"categorically rejects the claims of intentional harm to civilians\", and has previously blamed Hamas militants for fomenting chaos and endangering Gazans.

Of those, they still hold approximately 50 hostages - with 20 believed to be alive - after most of the others were released in ceasefires or other deals. Israel's retaliatory offensive has killed more than 60,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry, which does not differentiate between militants and civilians in its count."

        "Content": "\n          Sky correspondent\n              @sallylockwood\n We've seen this many times before.  Highly anticipated talks and meetings with America, Israel's closest ally and the one country with the power to pressure Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to change course, then nothing changes. We need to give Steve Witkoff time to report his assessments back to the White House before we can give a complete verdict on this visit but what we've seen and heard so far has offered little hope. The pressure on Donald Trump to stop the humanitarian catastrophe in Gaza is mounting after a small but vocal contingent of his base expressed outrage. Even one of his biggest supporters in Congress, Marjorie Taylor Green, has referred to it as a genocide. It was little coincidence Mr Witkoff was dispatched to the region for the first time in three months to speak to people on both sides and \"learn the truth\" to quote US ambassador to Israel, Mike Huckabee, who accompanied him to an aid site in Gaza.  The pair spent five hours in Gaza speaking to people at a Gaza Humanitarian Foundation centre and it's understood saw nothing of the large crowd of Palestinians gathering a mile away waiting for food. \n                  Over 100 journalists demand 'immediate and unsupervised' foreign media access into Gaza \n                 \n                  Hamas 'ready' to deliver aid to Israeli hostages, as 'appalling' videos of Israeli captive criticised\n                 \n                  Sydney Harbour Bridge pro-Palestine protest so busy it was 'perilous', police chief says\n                 Their sanitised tour of Gaza did not include a visit to a hospital where medics are receiving casualties by the dozen from deadly incidents at aid sites, and where they're treating children for malnutrition and hunger. A critical trauma nurse at Nasser hospital told us a 13-year-old boy was among the people shot while Mr Witkoff was in the enclave. An American paediatrician at the same hospital who had publicly extended an invitation to meet with Mr Witkoff heard nothing from the US delegation. Read more from Sky News:90mph 'danger to life' winds to hit UK tomorrow, Met Office warnsSearch for five trapped Chilean miners suffers setback  Dr Tom Adamkiewicz described people \"being shot like rabbits\" and \"a new level of barbarity that I don't think the world has seen\". The US delegation was defensive of the controversial GHF aid distribution that was launched by America and Israel in May, hailing its delivery of a million meals a day.  But if their new system of feeding Gaza is truly working, why are we seeing images of starved children and hearing deaths every day of people in search of food? The backdrop of this trip is very different to the last time Mr Witkoff was here. In May, life was a struggle for Palestinians in Gaza, people were dying in Israeli bombings but, for the most part, people weren't dying due to a lack of food or getting killed trying to reach aid. Mr Netanyahu's easing of humanitarian conditions a week ago, allowing foreign aid to drop from the sky, was an indirect admission of failure by the GHF. Yet, for now, the US is standing by this highly criticised way of delivering aid. A UN source tells me more aid is getting through than it was a week ago - around 30 lorries are due to enter today compared to around five that were getting in each day before. Still nowhere near enough and it's a complex process of clearances and coordination with the IDF through areas of conflict. Lorries are regularly refused entry without explanation. Then there was Mr Witkoff's meeting with hostage families a day later where we began to get a sense of America's new plan for Gaza. The US issued no public statement but family members shared conversations they'd had with Mr Trump's envoy: bring all the hostages home in one deal, disarm Hamas and end the war. Easier to propose than to put into practice. Within hours of those comments being reported in the Israeli media, Hamas released a video of hostage Evyatar David looking emaciated in an underground tunnel in Gaza.  Now 24 years old, he was kidnapped from the Nova festival on 7 October and is one of 20 hostages understood to be still alive. The release of the video was timed for maximum impact. Hamas also poured water on any hopes of a deal in a statement, refusing to disarm unless an independent Palestinian state is established. Hamas has perhaps become more emboldened in this demand after key Israeli allies, including the UK, announced plans for formal recognition in the last week. It's hard to see a way forward. The current Israeli government has, in effect, abandoned the idea of a two-state solution. The Trump administration's recent boycott of international conferences on the matter suggests America is taking a similar line, breaking with its long-standing position. Arab nations could now be key in what happens next. In an unprecedented move, Saudi Arabia, Qatar and Egypt joined a resolution calling for Hamas to disarm and surrender control of Gaza following a UN conference earlier this week. This is hugely significant - highly influential powers in its own backyard have not applied this sort of pressure before. For all the US delegation's good intentions, it's still political deadlock. Israeli hostages and Palestinians in Gaza left to starve and suffer the consequences."

        "Content": "\n          News correspondent\n              @ashnahurynag\n  Almost two months after Air India Flight 171's deadly crash, some of the 53 British nationals on board are only now being laid to rest. Some 300 friends, families, and locals from the Gujarati community in and around London gathered in Wembley for a prayer and memorial service dedicated to remembering some of the victims. Wearing his father's emerald ring that was miraculously recovered from the wreckage, Miten Patel addresses the crowd. His parents, Ashok and Shobhana Patel, were travelling back to their home in Orpington, Kent, after a spiritual trip to India, when they were killed in the crash on 12 June. Their funeral was held only days ago, after being delayed following the discovery that the remains of other individuals were found in Miten's mother's casket. He credits Professor Fiona Wilcox, the senior coroner at Inner West London Coroner's Court, for meeting with him and his family to break the news. \"My parents were the first ones repatriated in the UK,\" Miten explains - he organised the repatriation of his parents before he flew out to Ahmedabad. \"When they were back home, the first thing that they did was a CT scan. And that's when it came about, the CT scan showed that with mum's remains, there were further remains there too. \"I don't know what they were. I don't know how many.\" Miten's parents' funeral was attended by hundreds. His father, Ashok, was a financial adviser and his mother, Shobhana, was a retired microbiologist. As the eldest son, organising much of his parents' farewell fell to him. The concern around his mother's remains delayed the family's chance to grieve. \"I think there should be a level of responsibility taken. Why did that happen? Where was the flaw in that process? I mean I do understand that whole situation, people were rushing, people were very tired. \"You know, to get all the remains, then having to separate them by DNA, it's a long process. But really, for us as loved ones, it is very upsetting.\" Indian government spokesman Randhir Jaiswal previously said the country was \"working closely with the UK side from the moment these concerns and issues were brought to our attention\". \"In the wake of the tragic crash, the concerned authorities had carried out identification of victims as per established protocols and technical requirements,\" he said. \"All mortal remains were handled with utmost professionalism and with due regard for the dignity of the deceased. \"We are continuing to work with the UK authorities on addressing any concerns related to this issue.\" The flight crashed moments after take-off en route to Gatwick, killing 241 people on board. Horrifying images were beamed around the world within minutes. Confusion and fear spread like wildfire among relatives back in the UK, who immediately tried to get hold of their loved ones.

There was only one flight out of Ahmedabad back to London that day, and she had only just been texting her brother Sunny and his wife Monali, who'd been on holiday. The events of the past few weeks have been unfathomable. In her first interview about her brother and her sister-in-law, Komal explains how she flew out to India with her cousin Jina to go and identify her little brother. \"Because we weren't really allowed to see the body, I don't think I've really come to terms with it. I still think I'm dreaming and it's not really real,\" Komal tells us. Sunny and Monali Patel were in their 30s and about to celebrate their 10-year anniversary. The couple were the \"light\" and \"soul\" of their families. They loved having fun, playing with their nieces and nephews and adored travelling. Komal says her brother loved barbecues and her sister-in-law worked with children and adored hers too. \"They're just really fun, exciting, really lived life, just made memories, just made everyone really happy,\" says big sister Komal. \"They were like the heart of my kids. Whenever they walked into a room, they just filled up the room with laughter and happiness.\" The couple had been due to fly back home to London a week beforehand but postponed their flight. \"It has just been very traumatic, very, very sad for us, losing Sunny and Monali at 39 years old,\" says their cousin Jina. \"They were full of life and brought so much light into our family.

        "Content": "\n          News correspondent\n              @nicole_reporter\n  Tens of thousands of Sydney residents marched across the city's iconic Harbour Bridge to support Palestinians in Gaza and call for an end to the war.  The decision to centre the protest on such an iconic landmark was controversial. The bridge is considered a symbol of unity in the city. However, the Israel-Hamas war has been deeply divisive in Australia and increased tension between the country's Jewish and Muslim communities. On Sunday there were pro-Palestinian demonstrations in Melbourne, Adelaide and Sydney. In Sydney organisers hoped 50,000 people would attend, despite heavy rain. In the end, the bridge and the central business district were so packed - and the weather so bad - that police and organisers called the march off mid-way, fearing there would be a crush in the crowd. Police said the crowd numbers in the Sydney Harbour Bridge march were \"far greater\" than expected, creating the risk of a crowd crush. \n                  Video shows Australian towns blanketed in thick layer of snow during 'unusual' weather event\n                 \n                  Man who murdered British backpacker Peter Falconio dies - without revealing location of his victim's remains\n                 \n                  UK among 19 nations taking part in Australia's largest war exercise - as China expected to watch\n                 \"It was perilous,\" said senior officer Peter McKenna, adding his force was \"very lucky the crowd was well-behaved\". The final figures for the number of people who attended haven't been released. But it was an impressive turnout in the tens of thousands. Some of those attending the march, called by its organisers the March for Humanity, carried pots and pans as symbols of the hunger in the besieged enclave of Gaza. There was also a surprise guest, WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange. He has largely kept a low profile since his release from a British prison last year. He didn't speak to the crowd, but he was among those leading the march. However, the demonstration almost didn't happen after New South Wales police tried to stop it from taking place on the Harbour Bridge. On Saturday, the country's Supreme Court ruled it could go ahead. Despite the rain, there were families with children and seniors as well. It was a true cross-section of Australian society. One of the protesters, Sarah, drove up from the Blue Mountains outside Sydney to attend. She said, \"enough is enough\" and the Australian government should take \"stronger action\".

Australia has not joined France, the UK and Canada is announcing plans to recognise a Palestinian state in September. The government here says recognition is a matter of \"when not if\". But it has not committed to any timeline. Public pressure is growing on Prime Minister Anthony Albanese to take a stronger stand against the war. So far, he has largely resisted that pressure. But the government's language towards Israel is becoming more critical."

According to the Gazan government's media office, most of the humanitarian supplies were looted and stolen - \"as a result of the state of security chaos that the Israeli occupation systematically and deliberately perpetuates\". Officials say at least 600 truckloads of aid are required on a daily basis, adding: \"The needs of the population are worsening.\"  A statement released late last night called for \"the immediate opening of crossings, and the entry of aid and infant formula in sufficient quantities\" - and \"condemned in the strongest terms the continuation of the crime of starvation\".

        "Content": " A slew of Australian towns have been blanketed with their thickest layer of snow in decades, as wild weather swept across the east of the country. As much as 40cm (16 inches) of snow fell in northern parts of New South Wales on Saturday, the most since the mid-1980s, Miriam Bradbury, a meteorologist at Australia's weather bureau, said. She said parts of neighbouring state Queensland also saw snow for the first time in 10 years. The New South Wales State Emergency Service said unprecedented snow, coupled with heavy rain and thunderstorms in other parts of the state, has led to more than 1,455 incidents over the weekend. This included more than 100 vehicles being stranded on major roads and tens of thousands of homes losing power. A multi-agency search is also under way for a 26-year-old woman who was swept away in floodwaters in the Hunter Valley region, after the driver of a car she was in tried to travel through floodwater, New South Wales Police said. The driver of the car, a 27-year-old woman, was rescued without any injuries. The search is due to continue on Monday, the force said. Despite rain easing on Sunday, some parts of New England in the north of New South Wales were told to evacuate before 4pm due to flooding.

While a yellow weather warning for snow remains in place for the Northern Tablelands until 2am local time tomorrow. Climate change has made Australia's weather more volatile in recent years, meteorologist Ms Bradbury said, but this event was still unusual. She said: \"What makes this event unusual is how much snow we had but also how widespread, covering quite a large part of the northern tablelands.\""

        "Content": " Martin Lewis says motorists who were mis-sold car finance are likely to receive \"hundreds, not thousands of pounds\" - with regulators launching a consultation on a new compensation scheme. The founder of MoneySavingExpert.com believes it is \"very likely\" that about 40% of Britons who entered personal contact purchase or hire purchase agreements between 2007 and 2021 will be eligible for payouts. \"Discretionary commission arrangements\" saw brokers and dealers charge higher levels of interest so they could receive more commission, without telling consumers. Speaking to Sky News Radio's Faye Rowlands, Lewis said: \"Very rarely will it be thousands of pounds unless you have more than one car finance deal. \"So up to about a maximum of £950 per car finance deal where you are due compensation.\" Lewis explained that consumers who believe they may have been affected should check whether they had a discretionary commission arrangement by writing to their car finance company. However, the personal finance guru warned against using a claims firm. \n                  I'm a priest - I don't get paid a salary but I do get a house\n                 \n                  Spending review: More cash for schools, NHS and defence expected as chancellor unveils plans\n                 \n                  Holiday coming up?

Read more: How to tell if you've been mis-sold car finance  Yesterday, the Financial Conduct Authority said its review of the past use of motor finance \"has shown that many firms were not complying with the law or our disclosure rules that were in force when they sold loans to consumers\". The FCA's statement added that those affected \"should be appropriately compensated in an orderly, consistent and efficient way\". Lewis told Sky News that the consultation will launch in October - and will take six weeks. \"We expect payouts to come in 2026, assuming this will happen and it's very likely to happen,\" he said. \"As for exactly how will work, it hasn't decided yet. Firms will have to contact people, although there is an issue about them having destroyed some of the data for older claims.\" He believes claims will either be paid automatically - or affected consumers will need to opt in and apply to get compensation back.

Anyone who has already complained does not need to do anything.  The authority added: \"Consumers concerned that they were not told about commission, and who think they may have paid too much for the finance, should complain now\".  Its website advises drivers to complain to their finance provider first. \n\n If you're unhappy with the response, you can then contact the Financial Ombudsman. Any compensation scheme will be easy to participate in, without drivers needing to use a claims management company or law firm. The FCA has warned motorists that doing so could end up costing you 30% of any compensation in fees.  The FCA estimates the cost of any scheme - including compensation and administrative costs - to be no lower than £9bn. But in a video on X, Lewis said that millions of people are likely to be due a share of up to £18bn. The regulator's announcement comes after the Supreme Court ruled on a separate, but similar, case on Friday."

Exeter acted as the hub for Flybe, the regional carrier which collapsed in the aftermath of the pandemic. The deal will come amid a frenzy of activity involving Britain's major airports as infrastructure investors seek to exploit a recovery in their valuations.

The investment will support the pilot of the new \"one in, one out\" returns agreement between the UK and France, and other efforts to crack down on small boat crossings. Home Secretary Yvette Cooper said this new funding will \"strengthen\" the government's \"serious and comprehensive plan\" to dismantle the business model of criminal gangs smuggling migrants across the Channel. But the Conservatives have claimed the cash injection will make \"no real difference\", with shadow home secretary Chris Philp branding the move a Labour \"gimmick\" and a \"desperate grab for headlines\".  The funding will pay for up to 300 new National Crime Agency (NCA) officials, \"state-of-the art\" detection technology and new equipment to \"smash the networks putting lives at risk in the Channel\", ministers say. It will also allow the Border Security Command, the NCA, the police and other law enforcement agency partners to \"strengthen investigations targeting smuggling kingpins and disrupt their operations across Europe, the Middle East, Africa and beyond\".  The new investment comes as official figures show more than 25,000 people have arrived on small boats so far in 2025 - a record for this point in the year. Ms Cooper said: \"In the last 12 months, we have set the foundations for this new and much stronger law enforcement approach - establishing the new Border Security Command, strengthening the National Crime Agency and UK police operations, increasing Immigration Enforcement, introducing new counter terror style powers in our Border Security Bill, and establishing cooperation agreements with Europol and other countries. \"Now this additional funding will strengthen every aspect of our plan, and will turbo-charge the ability of our law enforcement agencies to track the gangs and bring them down, working with our partners overseas, and using state-of-the-art technology and equipment. \"Alongside our new agreements with France, this will help us drive forward our Plan for Change commitments to protect the UK's border security and restore order to our immigration system.\" Read more UK news:Inside prison doing family visits differentlyUK's most wanted man on run for 20 yearsCouple relive watching hours of riot chaos The £100m investment will also support new powers to be introduced when the Border Security, Asylum and Immigration Bill becomes law, the Home Office said. This includes the introduction of a UK-wide offence to criminalise the creation and publication of online material that promotes a breach of immigration law, such as the advertisement of small boat crossings on social media.  Research suggests about 80% of migrants arriving to the UK by small boat used internet platforms during their journey - including to contact agents linked to smuggling gangs. While it is already illegal to assist illegal immigration, ministers hope the creation of a new offence will give police more powers and disrupt business models. Mr Philp accused the Labour government of having \"no serious plan, just excuses, while ruthless criminal gangs flood our borders with illegal immigrants\". He said: \"The British public deserves real action, not empty slogans and tinkering at the edges.\""

The government has also pledged another £1m to help the World Health Organisation in Egypt provide medical support to evacuated Gazans. The prime minister told the Mirror: \"I know the British people are sickened by what is happening. \"The images of starvation and desperation in Gaza are utterly horrifying.

Uptake in some local authorities is as low as 60%, while the England-wide rate for the final quarter of 2024/25 for measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) was 88.8%, down from 92.7% 10 years ago. The latest UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) figures show there were 145 new measles cases in England in July. With outbreaks across Europe and elsewhere, public health officials are concerned families may bring the virus back to the UK when they return to school from the summer holidays. We look at why vaccination rates have declined, and the reasons some parents are still hesitant to get their children immunised. When did uptake start declining - and where is it worst now? Routine childhood vaccinations largely consist of the 6-in-1 vaccine, which covers diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, polio, Hib, and hepatitis B; the MMR vaccine for measles, mumps, and rubella; and the MenB vaccine, which covers the meningococcal group B bacterium that can cause meningitis and sepsis. They are all administered free of charge across two or three doses before children are five, with most in the first year. WHO recommends countries set targets of 95% coverage of all three to ensure herd immunity and to protect those who are immunocompromised and cannot have the vaccines themselves. In the UK, MMR rates have consistently been the lowest. The most recent decline began in 2013/14, when uptake at two years peaked at 92.7%.

In Hackney, east London, only 60% of children had received both their MMR jabs by their fifth birthday in the year 2023/24. The North West, and Liverpool in particular, also had lower uptake, with only 73% vaccinated against MMR by the age of five. Of the 674 measles cases reported in 2025, almost half (48%) have been in London, 16% in the North West, and 10% in the East of England. At local authority level, the most cases were reported in Hackney (12%), Bristol (7%), and Salford (5%), with almost all cases concentrated in either children under 10 or teenagers and young adults.  Why have rates declined? Although the recent drop began a decade ago, a much sharper decline happened in the 1990s. It saw the two-year MMR uptake in England go from 91.8% in 1995/96 to 79.9% in 2003/04. In 2006, person-to-person measles transmission was re-established in the UK, and a year later, rates exceeded 1,000 for the first time in 10 years. This came after the British doctor Andrew Wakefield published a now-discredited report in the prestigious medical journal The Lancet in 1998, which linked the MMR vaccine to autism. The study was reported by media outlets worldwide and resulted in the safety of the jab being questioned. After it proved baseless, The Lancet retracted the study in 2010. Wakefield was banned from practising medicine after being found guilty of dishonesty and the \"abuse\" of developmentally delayed children by subjecting them to unnecessary and invasive medical procedures without ethical approval. However, hesitancy around childhood vaccinations persisted. Professor Stephen Griffin, a virologist at the University of Leeds, says: \"As widely debunked as it was, it set the cat among the pigeons and poisoned everything.\"  What could be behind the latest drop? The increased prevalence of vaccines during the COVID-19 pandemic saw a resurgence in \"anti-vax\" sentiment, with many questioning the quick rollout of the jabs. Others pushed back against mandatory vaccines in certain settings, such as health and social care in the UK, and across most federal government departments in the US, citing a breach of freedom of choice. Hesitancy also proved stronger in some minority communities, which experts have linked to a general mistrust in healthcare services due to the disproportionate outcomes experienced by those groups. \"Well-organised and well-funded anti-vaccine movements latched onto mRNA (messenger RNA) vaccines, because while it's not a brand new technology, COVID was the first time they had been used en masse,\" Professor Griffin says. \"There was a lot of disinformation around them, and they just seized on it.\" However, WHO had already highlighted \"vaccine hesitancy\" as one of the top 10 global health threats in 2019, before the pandemic began. Some of this was attributed to Wakefield's study. Separately, with the rise of social media and misinformation, unevidenced conspiracy theories around vaccines have circulated, such as them being used by Microsoft founder Bill Gates to track people's movements. More recently, US President Donald Trump has expressed sentiments that nod to views shared by vaccine sceptics. In an interview with Time Magazine in 2024, he was asked if he would consider ending childhood vaccination programmes in the US. He said he would have a \"big discussion\" with Robert F. Kennedy Jr, who he appointed as his health secretary and who has consistently expressed vaccine sceptic views. Mr Trump said: \"The autism rate is at a level that nobody ever believed possible. If you look at things that are happening, there's something causing it.\" While not directly referencing it, his comments appeared to echo the baseless claims made in Wakefield's study. Professor Griffin says that \"reputable\" figures, such as politicians and scientists who continue to endorse the view of Wakefield, and other false narratives around vaccine efficacy, have legitimised the anti-vax movement and \"normalised\" the decision not to immunise children. \"They've essentially said 'there's no smoke without fire' and drawn attention to a question that they've created themselves,\" he says. \"It's really upsetting because we've got this brilliant vaccine that people aren't taking because of basic nonsense, and that has serious consequences. A person infected with measles is likely to infect between 15 and 20 others if they are unvaccinated. \"But the MMR vaccine is a victim of its own success. Measles was a large cause of infant mortality before we had the vaccine, but now people don't remember why we tried to make vaccines against it in the first place. \"So we need to educate people because they aren't aware of how dangerous it is.\"  'Lack of access' One children's health expert told Sky News the main issue is a lack of access. Helen Bedford, a professor of children's health at the UCL Great Ormond Street Institute, says everything from knowing how to book an appointment, to having the means to get there can be a barrier to children getting vaccinated. \"People may not know when vaccines are due, how to make an appointment, then there's actually getting to the appointment,\" she says. \"For some parents who are suffering the impact of poverty, paying a bus fare to get your child to a GP surgery may be a step too far, even though they understand vaccination is very important.\" A shortage of health visitors and other staff who can answer questions from vaccine-hesitant parents is also having an impact, she says. \"We want parents to ask questions but unfortunately, due to lack of personnel, they can't always get answers or even an opportunity to have a discussion,\" she said. \"That's when they turn to other sources of information, like social media or the internet, where we know there is a lot of disinformation.\""

        "Content": "The BBC has responded after it was reported that two Strictly Come Dancing stars have been accused of taking cocaine. The broadcaster is said to have hired an external law firm to probe the drug-taking allegations, which a source said were \"well-known\" on the show, The Sun on Sunday reports. The claims were reportedly made on behalf of celebrity contestant Wynne Evans in a legal submission to the BBC in March. In response, a BBC spokesperson told Sky News: \"We have clear protocols and policies in place for dealing with any serious complaint raised with us. We would always encourage people to speak to us if they have concerns. \"It would not be appropriate for us to comment further.\" Sky News understands that it is not unusual for the BBC to engage an external individual to provide additional expert resource to help deliver a BBC-led investigation. In these cases, they would report to an established BBC team. The allegations published in The Sun on Sunday include a source saying that one Strictly star had told another about a third celebrity on the show: \"Have you seen their pupils... they're off their face.\" \n                  Gregg Wallace speaks out after MasterChef sacking\n                 \n                  MasterChef series filmed last year to be broadcast after allegations against presenters upheld\n                 \n                  BBC reveals highest-earning stars - as pay list published\n                 \"The BBC have known about these allegations for some time, and acknowledged receiving them. Now they are taking firm action,\" the source reportedly said. The two individuals accused of drug taking have not been named. It is the latest crisis to hit the BBC and Strictly. In July last year, Amanda Abbington accused Strictly dancer Giovanni Pernice of \"abusive or threatening behaviour\". The actress, who was paired with Pernice, withdrew from the show in 2023. The BBC upheld \"some, but not all\" of the allegations, with Abbington describing an apology from the corporation as a \"vindication\", while Pernice denied displaying \"abusive or threatening behaviour\".

Separately, Laura Whitmore alleged \"inappropriate behaviour\" during her time on the show. In January this year, Welsh opera singer Wynne Evans made \"inappropriate and unacceptable\" comments at the Strictly Come Dancing live tour launch, for which he later apologised."
