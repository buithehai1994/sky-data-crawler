I don't shake hands with white slavers.\n\"Overthrow me, President, and the Americas and humanity will respond.\n\"You can try to carry out a coup with your economic strength and your arrogance.\"\nMr Trump posted a defiant message online: \"We will not allow the Colombian government to violate its legal obligations with regard to the acceptance and return of the criminals they forced into the United States!\"\nHis post was quickly followed by an AI-generated image showing the president in a fedora hat, alongside a sign reading FAFO, which usually stands for \"f*** around, find out\".\nIn a statement late on Sunday, Colombian foreign minister Luis Gilberto Murillo said: \"We have overcome the impasse with the US government.\"\nSunday's White House statement added that draft orders, imposing tariffs and sanctions on Colombia, would be \"held in reserve, and not signed, unless Colombia fails to honour this agreement\".\nThere was also a warning to other countries. \"Today's events make clear to the world that America is respected again. President Trump... expects all other nations of the world to fully cooperate in accepting the deportation of their citizens illegally present in the United States.\"\nBefore backing down, President Petro had demanded migrants deported by the US should be treated with dignity and respect.\n\"The US cannot treat Colombian migrants as criminals,\" Mr Petro wrote on X, noting that there were 15,660 Americans without proper immigration status in Colombia.\nPlease use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player\n\nColombia's decision to block military migrant flights follows a similar one byMexico, whichrefused a request to let a US military aircraft landwith migrants on Thursday.\nThere is growing discontent in South American countries as Mr Trump's week-old administration begins mass deportations.\nðŸ‘‰ Follow Trump 100 on your podcast app ðŸ‘ˆ\nOn Saturday, Brazil's foreign ministry condemned the \"degrading treatment\" of Brazilians after migrants were handcuffed on a commercial deportation flight.\nFollow our channel and never miss an update\nRead more from Sky News:Trump and Starmer 'agree to meet soon'Holocaust survivor 'jumped from death train'Rebels in DRC take key city\nBrazilian officials ordered the removal of the handcuffs when the plane landed and President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva designated a Brazilian Air Force (FAB) flight to complete their journey, the government said in a statement on Saturday.\nUsing military aircraft to carry out deportation flights is a response to Mr Trump's national emergency declaration on immigration on Monday.\nAlthough US military aircraft have been used in emergencies like the US withdrawal from Afghanistan in 2021, this is the first time in recent memory they have been used to fly migrants out of the country, one US official said.\nMilitary aircraft carried out two similar flights, each with about 80 migrants, to Guatemala on Friday.\nBe the first to getBreaking News\nInstall the Sky News app for free"

        "Content": "As remarkable as the national and international reaction at the time of his death, is the phenomenon that Sir Winston Churchill endures as an iconic figure, more than half a century later.\nSky News commentator@adamboultonTABB\nSunday 26 January 2025 04:38, UK\nSir Winston Churchill died 60 years ago this week on 24 January 1965. His funeral took place on 30 January, following three days lying in state in the Palace of Westminster.\nIt was the only occasion since the Second World War when a full state funeral was held for someone who was not a member of the Royal Family.\nChurchillwas venerated then as the prime minister who had led Great Britain to victory over Hitler and the Nazis. He has repeatedly topped surveys asking for the \"Greatest Briton\" since.\nIn 1965, many people who had lived through the war were still alive. The Royal Mint struck a 'Churchill Crown', with a nominal value of five shillings, to mark his life and death. Such commemorative issues were a rarity in the 1960s.\nThe funeral itself was an exceptional and grand event, involving thousands of troops from all branches of the armed services. It had been planned for at least 12 years, with its ailing subject taking an active interest.\nIts sombre splendour cemented Britain's reputation for ceremonial spectacle but afterwards, French President General Charles de Gaulle, who Churchill had grudgingly allowed to be invited, commented: \"Now Britain is no longer a great power.\"\nAs remarkable as the national and international reaction at the time of his death, is the phenomenon that Sir Winston Churchill endures as an iconic figure, more than half a century later.\nDonald Trump's comments on Gaza trigger tensions with his Arab-American supporters\nDay 8: Trump calls Starmer\nColombia quickly found out Trump has no intention of backing down\nYet another drama depicting Churchill is opening on stage in London. This time Roger Allam, Inspector Thursday in the EndeavourTV series, is playing the great man in Churchill in Moscow, following in the footsteps of other stars including Brian Cox, Albert Finney, Timothy Spall, Timothy West, Robert Hardy and Richard Burton.\nBust returned twice\nMeanwhile, with the inauguration of a new US president, the location of a bust of Sir Winston has once again become a hot topic, in Britain's right-wing media outlets at least.\nðŸ‘‰ Follow Trump 100 on your podcast app ðŸ‘ˆ\nDonald Trumphas re-instated the bronze by Sir Jacob Epstein in a prominent position in the Oval Office. It was originally a loan from the British Embassy to President George W Bush. Both Trump's immediate presidential predecessors, Barack Obama and Joe Biden,had it moved elsewherein the White House. Trump has now put it back twice.\nObama put a bust of Martin Luther King Junior in pride of place. Joe Biden favoured the Irish-American Bobby Kennedy. RFK senior that is, not his son RFK junior, the Kennedy family renegade now nominated as Trump's health secretary.\nThere has long been another identical copy of the Epstein bust in the presidential private quarters - a gift to Lyndon Johnson in 1965.\nChurchill's grandson, Nicholas Soames, a former Conservative MP who is now in the House of Lords, is unimpressed by all the fuss. He points out: \"It's loaned. I promise you, it's not a sign of the strength or otherwise of the special relationship, whether or not Churchill's head is in the White House.\"\nTrump's admiration for Churchill is more personal than anglophile. His glaring official photo portrait for this year's inauguration is almost a pastiche of Churchill's frequent \"we shall never surrender\" poses, just as some Trump posts on social media garble some of Churchill's most famous quotations. The Darkest Hour, featuring Gary Oldman as Churchill, is one of the films Trump has identified as his favourite movie.\nLeader comparisons\nThe president's closest allies like to draw comparisons between the two men. In 2020, when Trump muscled his way to St John's Church opposite the White House for a photo-op after it had been damaged by a firebomb, his official spokesman said it was \"a message of resilience and determination, like Churchill inspecting the bombing damage\", presumably of the Blitz.\nAfter visiting his father following this summer's deadly assassination attempt in Pennsylvania, Trump's son Eric likened him to Churchill due to his \"lack of political correctness\".\nTrump is not the only US president to emulate Churchill. Both Eisenhower and George W Bush tried their hand at painting, inspired in part by Churchill's skill with the brush.\nTrump is a great admirer of pageantry and may be disappointed that, at 24.6 million, the TV audience for his second inauguration did not match either Joe Biden's or Barack Obama's first.\nPart of the explanation may be increasing fragmentation of audiences by new media represented by the tech billionaires, who were invited to attend the ceremony in person by Trump.\nIn 1965 a similar number, 25 million, watched Churchill's funeral in the UK, an overwhelming mass audience in a much smaller country than the US. There were only two TV channels then and the ceremony was broadcast live by both the BBC and ITV.\nOn the BBC, it was the last state occasion anchored by Richard Dimbleby, the patriarch of the Dimbleby broadcasting family. There were large TV audiences in the US as well. The funeral was not shown live on RTE in Ireland. Neither the Irish president nor prime minister attended the ceremony.\nI was a small boy then and remember the coverage as one of the two great highlights of the black and white television era. The other was England's World Cup victory in 1966. Extended outside broadcast from multiple locations were a rarity. Both the funeral and the cup final took place during the day on a Saturday - a time when, back then, there was usually nothing to watch on TV sets.\nRare honour of state funeral\nThe funeral was a television spectacular involving foot soldiers and cavalry, RAF fly-bys and travel by boat, train, manpower and hearse. The ceremonies had been in planning since Churchill had his first major stroke in 1953.\nHe was serving his second term as prime minister and the poor state of his health was covered up from the public, even though he was left partially paralysed. Officials in the know, working for the royals and at Westminster, set to work to prepare Operation Hope Not.\nPutting the plan into action required a message from the Queen to parliament and a motion in parliament the day after Churchill died to authorise a state funeral.\nFull state funerals are usually reserved for heads of state. The late Queen Mother, Princess Diana, the late Duke of Edinburgh, and former prime minister Margaret Thatcher were all given ceremonial funerals in recent years - but none of these were state funeral in terms of scale or international protocol. Britain's next state funeral was for Elizabeth II in September 2022.\nChurchill's embalmed body lay in state round the clock in Westminster Hall for three days. More than 300,000 people filed past to pay their respects. Then the funeral began when Big Ben struck 9.45am. The bell was silenced for the day after that but there was a 90-gun salute in Hyde Park, a volley for each year of Churchill's life.\nFollow our channel and never miss an update\nAs soldiers and spectators lined the streets of London, Churchill's coffin was placed on a gun carriage and pulled by 98 sailors from the Royal Navy all the way to St Paul's Cathedral. It was carried inside with honorary pallbearers including three other British prime ministers and an Australian one. Clement Attlee, aged 82, stumbled on the steps and was given a chair to rest on.\nQueen broke with protocol\nAfter the service, the catafalque was drawn to the pier by Tower Bridge and taken upriver to Waterloo Station. Dockside cranes dipped as the boat passed. There is some dispute as to how voluntary this gesture by dockers really was. Even though his final journey was by locomotive down the Great Western Railway, Churchill insisted on going via Waterloo rather than Paddington station to make a point about British historical glory.\nHe was buried at St Martin's Church, Bladon, on the Blenheim estate, seat of the Duke of Marlborough, a cousin, alongside his parents and other members of the Spencer Churchill family.\nBe the first to getBreaking News\nInstall the Sky News app for free\nChurchill was the first prime minister of Queen Elizabeth's reign. Throughout the funeral day she broke with protocol to give him precedence. She hosted a reception for the dignitaries in attendance including the nine monarchs, 15 presidents and 14 serving prime ministers.\nIt is perhaps just as well that Donald Trump will not be around to see if his final obsequies beat that."

Will her new zeal - and practical plans - finally bring growth?\nPolitical correspondent@amandaakass\nSunday 26 January 2025 17:53, UK\nPlease use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player\n\nThe chancellor spent most of her first six months issuing dire warnings about the calamitous state of the public finances she inherited.\nBut now, in a dramatic change of tone,Rachel Reevesis celebrating the UK's economic possibilities.\nInspired byDonald Trump'seconomic boosterism, and despite the UK's flatlining growth figures, she toldTrevor Phillipsshe's spent the past few days in Davos \"shouting on the world stage about everything our great country has to offer\".\n\"My enthusiasm and excitement... has never burned brighter.\"\nBut this optimistic message isn't just part of a new international sales pitch, a riposte to critics who believe the chancellor damaged investor confidence in the UK with her gloomy previous prognosis.\nInstead, it's part of the government's drive to reconnect with businesses bruised by her tax-raising budget - an attempt to demonstrate that economic growth genuinely is its number one priority - at the expense, perhaps, of all else.\nOf course, the chancellor argues that growth is needed to deliver the level of public services voters expect from aLabour government- without rapid improvements to the public finances, departments are likely to face austerity-level cuts.\nNow we're finally getting more detail on the practical strategy to deliver the growth that has proved so elusive for successive governments in recent years - but many of the measures involved are highly controversial.\nRead more:Reeves to seek billions from corporate pension surpluses\nFrom reducing planning hurdles to demanding regulators strip out red tape, in some ways, the Labour government is now seeking to enact many of the policies promised by Liz Truss.\nAsked about the comparison by Trevor Phillips this morning, Ms Reeves didn't deny the similarity, arguing only that \"we're doing practical things to get that growth, not just talking about it\".\nOn Wednesday in a big speech on growth, we'll hear more about these practical steps.\nThe biggest expected announcement is about thelong-awaited expansion of Heathrow Airport, as well as plans for Gatwick and Luton.\nAs a symbol of going for growth above all else, it couldn't get much bigger, but the reason the project has failed to get off the ground is that so many people object to it so passionately - for a wide range of reasons, from concern over emissions and our net zero commitments to noise pollution.\nMs Reeves told Trevor Philips today the decision would be taken with \"collective ministerial responsibility\".\nThat may be easier said than done.\nRead more from Sky News:Man, 19, arrested after female police officer hit by carReeves: 'No stone should be left unturned' in Southport inquiryMan, 53, charged with murder of university lecturer\nPreviously, many members of the cabinet, including Sir Keir Starmer, Environment Secretary Steve Reed and Energy Secretary Ed Miliband voted against expanding the west London airport.\nSupporting the plans will surely be uncomfortable for many on the Labour benches, especially with the Mayor of London so implacably opposed.\nAsked this week if he'd consider resigning over it, though, Mr Miliband responded: \"Don't be ridiculous, no.\"\nPlease use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player\n\nPerhaps the clearest indication of the government's economic focus comes with the chancellor's willingness todiscuss the possibility of joining a European customs grouping, the Pan Euro Mediterranean Convention.\n\"We are absolutely happy to look at these proposals,\" she told Trevor Phillips - quite a contrast to the non-committal answers given by other ministers earlier this week.\nThe Conservatives are predictably up in arms, with Andrew Griffiths, the shadow business secretary, quick to ring the Brexit alarm bell.\n\"We must avoid undoing Brexit by the back door by aligning with the EU's low growth model,\" he said.\nBe the first to getBreaking News\nInstall the Sky News app for free\nFollow our channel and never miss an update\nWhile the prime minister has long promised a \"reset\" in relations with the EU, any hint of backpedalling on Brexit is so politically sensitive that discussion about moving towards a closer economic relationship is always muted.\nThe fact Ms Reeves is even looking into this is perhaps, more than anything, a sign of their desire to show they're willing to consider all options.\nBut as with the airports, it's likely to be a very long time before any of these pro-growth intentions have a practical impact on GDP."

Will her new zeal - and practical plans - finally bring growth?\nPolitical correspondent@amandaakass\nSunday 26 January 2025 17:53, UK\nPlease use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player\n\nThe chancellor spent most of her first six months issuing dire warnings about the calamitous state of the public finances she inherited.\nBut now, in a dramatic change of tone,Rachel Reevesis celebrating the UK's economic possibilities.\nInspired byDonald Trump'seconomic boosterism, and despite the UK's flatlining growth figures, she toldTrevor Phillipsshe's spent the past few days in Davos \"shouting on the world stage about everything our great country has to offer\".\n\"My enthusiasm and excitement... has never burned brighter.\"\nBut this optimistic message isn't just part of a new international sales pitch, a riposte to critics who believe the chancellor damaged investor confidence in the UK with her gloomy previous prognosis.\nInstead, it's part of the government's drive to reconnect with businesses bruised by her tax-raising budget - an attempt to demonstrate that economic growth genuinely is its number one priority - at the expense, perhaps, of all else.\nOf course, the chancellor argues that growth is needed to deliver the level of public services voters expect from aLabour government- without rapid improvements to the public finances, departments are likely to face austerity-level cuts.\nNow we're finally getting more detail on the practical strategy to deliver the growth that has proved so elusive for successive governments in recent years - but many of the measures involved are highly controversial.\nRead more:Reeves to seek billions from corporate pension surpluses\nFrom reducing planning hurdles to demanding regulators strip out red tape, in some ways, the Labour government is now seeking to enact many of the policies promised by Liz Truss.\nAsked about the comparison by Trevor Phillips this morning, Ms Reeves didn't deny the similarity, arguing only that \"we're doing practical things to get that growth, not just talking about it\".\nOn Wednesday in a big speech on growth, we'll hear more about these practical steps.\nThe biggest expected announcement is about thelong-awaited expansion of Heathrow Airport, as well as plans for Gatwick and Luton.\nAs a symbol of going for growth above all else, it couldn't get much bigger, but the reason the project has failed to get off the ground is that so many people object to it so passionately - for a wide range of reasons, from concern over emissions and our net zero commitments to noise pollution.\nMs Reeves told Trevor Philips today the decision would be taken with \"collective ministerial responsibility\".\nThat may be easier said than done.\nRead more from Sky News:Man, 19, arrested after female police officer hit by carReeves: 'No stone should be left unturned' in Southport inquiryMan, 53, charged with murder of university lecturer\nPreviously, many members of the cabinet, including Sir Keir Starmer, Environment Secretary Steve Reed and Energy Secretary Ed Miliband voted against expanding the west London airport.\nSupporting the plans will surely be uncomfortable for many on the Labour benches, especially with the Mayor of London so implacably opposed.\nAsked this week if he'd consider resigning over it, though, Mr Miliband responded: \"Don't be ridiculous, no.\"\nPlease use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player\n\nPerhaps the clearest indication of the government's economic focus comes with the chancellor's willingness todiscuss the possibility of joining a European customs grouping, the Pan Euro Mediterranean Convention.\n\"We are absolutely happy to look at these proposals,\" she told Trevor Phillips - quite a contrast to the non-committal answers given by other ministers earlier this week.\nThe Conservatives are predictably up in arms, with Andrew Griffiths, the shadow business secretary, quick to ring the Brexit alarm bell.\n\"We must avoid undoing Brexit by the back door by aligning with the EU's low growth model,\" he said.\nBe the first to getBreaking News\nInstall the Sky News app for free\nFollow our channel and never miss an update\nWhile the prime minister has long promised a \"reset\" in relations with the EU, any hint of backpedalling on Brexit is so politically sensitive that discussion about moving towards a closer economic relationship is always muted.\nThe fact Ms Reeves is even looking into this is perhaps, more than anything, a sign of their desire to show they're willing to consider all options.\nBut as with the airports, it's likely to be a very long time before any of these pro-growth intentions have a practical impact on GDP."

Son of the Century.\nWhen asked what is behind the popularity of his novels on the dictator, Mr Scurati told Sky News: \"Probably because the story is told from [Mussolini's] side.\n\"I am an anti-fascist, but I believe in order to understand deeply what fascism has been in my country and elsewhere, it is necessary to look deeply at the fascist inside us.\n\"That's how I conceived my novels, in the same way Wright brilliantly brought the idea into this documentary.\"\nHe said that he believes many elements of fascism still live on, with the defining feature being when \"fear prevails over the hope of democracy\".\nHe added: \"Mussolini was the master of politics of fear. He came from the Socialist Party, which was party of hope, and he was kicked out. Then he bet everything on fear, and that can happen again.\"\nRead more from Sky News:Strictly star apologises for 'inappropriate' languageCampaigners call for NDA law changes\nFollow our channel and never miss an update\nWright added that he understood the fascist history of Italy is a \"very contentious and emotional issue\" for a lot of people, but agreed with Mr Scurati that he thinks there is a \"sense of fascism within all of us\".\n\"What I discovered was that fascism is a politicisation of toxic masculinity and that exists everywhere, global responsibility and global problem,\" he said.\nAsked how he would describe the Mussolini he had created for the series, the director said: \"A deeply flawed human being.\"\nMussolini: Son Of The Century will debut on 4 February exclusively on Sky Atlantic and stream on NOW in the UK."

        "Content": "Zelda Perkins was the first woman to break a Weinstein-related NDA - an action which helped expose the Miramax movie producer's predatory behaviour. Now, she's calling for the government to change laws surrounding the agreements.\nArts and entertainment correspondent\nSunday 26 January 2025 08:48, UK\nA former assistant to Harvey Weinstein has accused parliament of being too \"slow to act\" on the misuse of non-disclosure agreements (NDAs) â€“ saying there has been \"a clear trail\" of their use at the root of \"every scandal of abuse\".\nIn 2017, Zelda Perkins was the first woman to break a Weinstein-related NDA signed decades earlier, an action which helped exposethe Miramax movie producer's predatory behaviour to the world.\nSince then, through her organisation Can't Buy My Silence, she's been a vocal campaigner to try to get changes to the law.\nExplaining her frustrations in an interview with Sky News, she said: \"Since Weinstein's horrific behaviour was exposed nearly seven years ago we have seen other powerful abusers exposed on a monthly basisâ€¦ there is a clear trail of the use of NDAs at the root of every scandal of abuse.\n\"International law is changing fast but the UK is being slow to act, which is especially frustrating to me as this is where the first exposure of the systemic use of NDAs to protect the powerful was highlighted.\"\nAn NDA is a legally binding contract that protects confidential information between parties. While they were conceived to protect Intellectual Property (IP) and can have a legitimate place in the world of business to protect client confidentiality, their misuse made headlines once again this year when hundreds of women came forward to make claims that NDAs had been used to silence victims of the late Harrods boss Mohamed al Fayed.\nMs Perkins argues there's indisputable evidence that legal changes are needed.\nStrictly star Wynne Evans apologises for 'inappropriate' language during tour launch\nDirector Joe Wright on 'global problem' of fascism and what can be learnt from 'deeply flawed' Mussolini\nHolly Willoughby tells of 'tough' year\n\"We have the law to protect us from ourselves and, if the law is being misused as a tool of abuse, then we have a duty to change that.\"\nShe believes changes haven't happened yet because there is \"an enormous amount of fear in the halls of power about taking away the ability to silence people who are going to show up your wrongdoing.\"\nWhile Ireland, Canada and the US have all introduced legislative changes, the UK hasn't prioritised amending its law - but could that be about to change?\nThe government has said it intends to implement the Conservative plan to ban NDA use in universities, and its understood to be considering how to ban their misuse by employers more widely.\nAt a recent select committee hearing, workers' rights minister Justin Madders confirmed the government is \"looking closely\" at whether changes could be made via its landmark employment rights bill - pitched by Number 10 as \"the biggest upgrade to workers' rights in a generation\".\nIn a statement, the government promised to \"set out its position on any amendments...in parliament\".\nFollow our channel and never miss an update\nFor years, Ms Perkins has campaigned for NDAs to only be used for their intended purpose - to protect IP and trade secrets - and argues they should only be able to be requested by a victim with certain provisions in a settlement agreement.\nWhile Ms Perkins' experience was in the world of film, a number of leading music industry voices have spoken to Sky News about the problematic way in which they feel NDAs are being used.\nCharisse Beaumont, the chief executive at Black Lives in Music, claims the agreements \"are used to cover up criminal criminality in its extreme natureâ€¦ exploiting the music, bullying and blackmailingâ€¦ it's rife\".\nShe says: \"You've got high-profile casesâ€¦ cases of individuals who have numerous cases in court, numerous testimonies of people saying they've been abused by them, yet they're still able to work. Some of them are still being promoted.\n\"Can you imagine being a victim and watching the person who did something to you be promoted?\"\nSean 'Diddy' Combs - who awaits trial for sex trafficking and racketeering, which he strenuously denies - was at the height of his fame in the noughties.\nA former music video dancer from back then has told Sky News the use of NDAs within music was always widespread.\nElisabeth Ovesen said she would \"come dressed ready for a party, get to the door, and there's an NDA before you can step in\".\nBe the first to getBreaking News\nInstall the Sky News app for free\nFormer reality star Katie Waissel has left the music industry behind to study law. She now campaigns against the use of NDAs.\n\"I've had many conversations with former secretaries of state, the DCMS [Departure for Culture, Media and Sport], for example, the former home secretary, alongside many, many other amazing people being campaigning for legislative change.\n\"I understand nondisclosure agreements in terms of protecting trade, like a formula for haircare or something else like that. But for the music industry, and it being so one-sided for this company, it begs me to ask the question - why so secretive? What are you trying to hide? What are you trying to cover up?\""
