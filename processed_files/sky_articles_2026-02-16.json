        "Headline": "Thirty councils had delayed their elections until next year after the government asked them to - but they now have three months to prepare.",
        "Content": "The government has abandoned plans to postpone 30 local elections in May following legal advice. Labour announced in December it was planning to cancel elections in 30 areas - affecting more than 4.5 million people - to overhaul English council structures. But on Monday, the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government (MHCLG) said it was no longer going ahead with the plan due to \"new legal advice\". Politics latest: Which councils are affected? Reform UK had launched a legal challenge against the government, and the legal advice was in reaction to that case. A letter from the government's legal department to MHCLG, seen by Sky News, said the government will pay Reform's legal costs. Sky News understands the legal costs are in six figures. An MHCLG spokesman said: \"Following legal advice, the government has withdrawn its original decision to postpone 30 local elections in May. \"Providing certainty to councils about their local elections is now the most crucial thing and all local elections will now go ahead in May 2026.\" The department has written to all 30 councils to confirm elections will go ahead in May. There will also be a £63m fund to help local councils across those areas reorganise their structures, with \"practical support\" also on offer. Reform UK's leader Nigel Farage told broadcasters that the government had \"caved\". \"It's a victory for Reform. But more importantly, it's a victory for democracy in this country. We are delighted,\" he said. He added that the government had U-turned because they would have lost in court - and suggested Local Government Secretary Steve Reed's job should be at risk. U-turn number 15 This is now the 15th U-turn by Sir Keir's government since coming to power in July 2024. Less than two hours before the announcement, the prime minister was asked by the BBC if he would \"stick to your course now after those U-turns\". He responded: \"Absolutely. I know exactly why I was elected in with a five-year mandate to change this country for the better, and that's what I intend to do.\" Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch called the U-turn \"predictable chaos from a useless government that cannot make basic decisions\". Most of the councils that had chosen to postpone, after being invited to by the government in December, were Labour - and Ms Badenoch called the few Conservative-run authorities to choose postponement \"silly\". She said Mr Reed now has \"very serious questions to answer on whether political considerations were behind his decision\" - and she threatened to use \"every means at our disposal to get to the truth\" if he does not. Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey said they \"cannot allow the government to cancel elections on a whim ever again\", and said his party wanted to change the law to strip ministers of that power. Councils and voters 'bewildered' Campaigners expressed relief at this latest U-turn but also exasperation over how little time councils now have to put on elections in less than three months. Elliot Keck, campaigns director of the TaxPayers' Alliance, said: \"Taxpayers will be hugely relieved to see their right to a vote restored, but it should have never come this far. \"Millions of voters were not just facing cancelled elections, but also the double injustice of increased council tax despite a complete lack of a democratic mandate. \"Ministers should still bring in new guidelines making clear that were any elections to be cancelled in future, for any reason, there would be a mandatory freeze on council tax and any other charges.\" Read more:PM pledges social media crackdown'Mutinous mood' at UK's Foreign Office The District Councils' Network, which represents 169 English councils, said councils and voters \"will be bewildered by the unrelenting changes to the electoral timetable\". Richard Wright, chair of the DCN, added: \"Councils were assured by the government that elections could be legally cancelled but now it seems ministers have come to the opposite conclusion. \"The councils affected face an unnecessary race against time to ensure elections proceed smoothly and fairly, with polling stations booked and electoral staff available.\""

        "Content": "\n          Political correspondent\n              @MhariAurora\n The government has changed its mind again. By my count, for the 15th time. The government planned to postpone local elections in 30 areas of England due to take place in May, but after a court challenge from Reform UK, it thought better of it. With government lawyers offering new legal advice saying the proposed cancellation of these elections would, in fact, be illegal, this means that over 4 and a half million extra people will be voting in May after all. But why did the government want to cancel these elections? Labour argued that it was a waste of time, money and resources to hold elections for councils that would soon be abolished and merged into larger council structures anyway. But that justification appeared not to be legally robust enough to reassure the government that it could win the legal case. And not only has the government scrapped these plans, but it also now has to scrap planned legislation it created to make these changes possible. And what's more, it has agreed to pay Reform's legal fees - something Sky News understands to be a six-figure sum. Read more:Every Labour U-turn in 19 monthsInvestigation launched into Labour campaign group claim Opposition parties are celebrating this U-turn as a victory for democracy. But it is Reform UK that ultimately forced the government to change course with its legal action, something Nigel Farage will not let Sir Keir Starmer forget in a hurry In an interview just hours before this latest change of heart, the prime minister promised no more U-turns. But by our maths at Sky News, this makes it U-turn number 15. And with even more councils and council seats up for grabs in May than first thought, Sir Keir has even more to lose."

        "Content": "A nine-year-old boy has become the first patient to have pioneering leg-lengthening surgery in the UK. Alfie Phillips, from Northampton, has fibular hemimelia, a rare condition that affects fewer than one in 40,000 births in the UK each year. It caused his right leg not to develop properly, leaving it about four centimetres shorter than his left. According to specialists, it would have grown to be six centimetres shorter by the time he was 16. Speaking to the Press Association (PA), Alfie said his schoolmates used to say \"I ran a bit different, and I couldn't skip\", and that by the time he was five, \"it started to get a bit annoying\". \"If they ever wanted a conversation, other than my friends, it was always going to be about my condition,\" he added. \"When I was obviously a lot younger, I didn't think it was any different because I grew up with it.\" The operation explained Doctors were able to extend Alfie's leg by installing a lengthening nail on the surface of his thigh bone. This was then slowly pulled apart by a special magnet, used three times a day for a month, with the body creating new bone tissue to fill the gap. Procedures using lengthening nails - fitted inside the bone - were not previously available to younger children due to the risk of damage. But before the operation at Alder Hey Children's Hospital in Liverpool, Alfie's only option for treatment was to have an external frame fixed to his bone from the outside of his limb. Treatment started in March last year. Almost a year on, Alfie said he's feeling good and enjoys being taller than his friends. \"I can just tower over them now… I like doing basketball a lot,\" he said. 'That leg difference became a lot more significant' Laura Ducker, Alfie's mum, told PA her son was diagnosed with fibular hemimelia within six months being born. His father first raised concerns when he noticed his son only had three toes on one foot, but Alfie met all his milestones as a baby as expected. Ms Ducker, who is an NHS midwife, said while \"it really didn't affect him massively when he was little\", as he got older, \"that leg difference became a lot more significant\". There was a risk it could cause problems with Alfie's hips and joints, she said, and so sought advice from Alder Hey's consultant orthopaedic surgeon Nick Peterson after hearing about him on a Facebook support group. Read more from Sky News:New weather warnings for snow and iceObama says aliens 'are real'Royal Mail warns of service delays 'Unheard of' recovery Describing Alfie's recovery, Mr Peterson told PA his team was left \"amazed\" by Alfie's rapid recovery. \"After about seven days, his pain score went down to zero out of 10, which is pretty much unheard of,\" he said. \"He didn't require anything other than the occasional paracetamol after a few days, and that was it. That is extremely unusual. \"So his recovery was remarkably quick and really, really impressive.\""

The Metropolitan Police said officers had made 248 arrests for stealing mobiles and seized about 770 devices, with a further 122 people arrested for other offences as part of a wider effort.

Commissioner Sir Mark Rowley said fewer Londoners were \"facing the stress, cost, and disruption that comes with having their phone stolen\" - but called on the courts to stop releasing repeat offenders.

After graduating from Principia College in ​Illinois and serving in the US Army, he moved to New York - where he lived with Dustin Hoffman and befriended Gene Hackman when the three were struggling acting students. He appeared in various Broadway and off-Broadway plays, including productions of Arthur Miller's The Crucible and A View From The Bridge, and had TV roles before making his big screen debut in the 1963 adaptation of To Kill A Mockingbird, playing Arthur \"Boo\" Radley. During his prolific career on screen, Duvall created a range of unforgettable characters that made him one of Hollywood's greats. 'One of the best in the world' He earned his first Oscar nomination in the best supporting actor category for playing Mafia consigliere Tom Hagen in 1972's The Godfather - a role he reprised in The Godfather Part II. In 1979, he was nominated in the supporting category once again, this time for his scene-stealing performance as Lieutenant Colonel Bill Kilgore in 1979's Apocalypse Now. Filmmaker Francis Ford Coppola, who directed both films, once described him as being \"one of the four or five best actors in the world\" in an interview with People Magazine.

        "Content": "\n          Science correspondent\n              @SkyNewsThomas\n Parts of Britain could be at risk of further flooding for months to come because so much rain has fallen so far this year, according to new analysis. Latest official figures from the UK Centre for Ecology and Hydrology (UKCEH) show rivers in the south and southwest of England reached exceptionally high levels in January, with some breaking records. And the soil is so saturated in areas that have borne the brunt of the deluge that water is rising up through the ground - an invisible threat that could suddenly flood homes. The Environment Agency (EA) has also warned of a significant risk of so-called groundwater flooding that could persist for months. Mark Garratt, flood duty manager at the agency, said: \"Significant groundwater flooding impacts are probable in parts of Dorset and Wiltshire, with minor groundwater impacts probable in Hampshire and West Sussex. \"Due to steadily rising levels, minor groundwater flooding impacts are possible in Kent and East Sussex.\" Check the weather forecast in your area The monthly statistics from the UKCEH confirm that Northern Ireland and the southwest of England had their wettest January on record, with 170% of their normal rainfall. It was also one of the five wettest Januarys since 1890 for southern counties of England. River levels in the affected areas surged as a result, with three reaching their highest flows for January, and two setting a record. Monitoring at boreholes across Dorset, Wiltshire, Hampshire, Sussex, and Kent also showed that groundwater levels at 29 sites were above normal. At 28 sites levels were so high that there was a risk of flooding from water rising from beneath people's homes. And at 10 sites levels had reached their highest on record. Groundwater flooding 'can take people by surprise' Professor Hannah Cloke, a world-leading hydrologist at Reading University, told Sky News: \"Groundwater flooding is invisible. It comes up through the floorboards. It seeps out in the middle of the night, and people aren't expecting it. \"It's not like you're living near to a river, and you expect that flooding. So it can be very serious. It can take people by surprise. \"And it is very persistent. It can last for a long time. So this could last for months in some of these places.\" Read more from Sky News:PM abandons plans to delay council electionsPolice using drones to catch phone thieves According to the Met Office, the jet stream is lying further south than normal for the time of year. The high altitude winds have also been supercharged by cold weather in North America, generating bands of persistent rain that have lingered over parts of the UK. Further rain is forecast and the EA has urged people to stay alert to flood warnings."

Nancy was last seen on 31 January when her family dropped her off at her home near Tucson following dinner with them. Relatives reported her missing the following day, authorities said. Mr Nanos added that Nancy, who has a pacemaker, was extremely limited in her physical mobility and could not have left her home unassisted, leading investigators to believe she had been taken against her will early on. Since her disappearance, at least two purported ransom notes have surfaced. Both were initially delivered to media outlets, but there has been no known direct contact between Ms Guthrie's presumed captors and her family, or with authorities.

A girl and two boys, who are aged 15 and 16, and cannot be named for legal reasons, had been on trial for the murder of Alexander Cashford in Leysdown-on-Sea, on the Isle of Sheppey, Kent, on 10 August last year. The girl and the 15-year-old boy had denied manslaughter but were found guilty by a jury at Woolwich Crown Court, while a 16-year-old boy previously pleaded guilty to the same offence. All three were acquitted of murder. The court heard how the teenagers thought Mr Cashford, 49, was a paedophile and lured him to a beach before hitting him with rocks and a bottle. He was found lying face down in the mud. Jurors were told the victim had given the girl his number on 8 August after meeting her at an amusement arcade and had handed her a business card, which included a name that was not his. The three exchanged messages with Mr Cashford, who claimed to be 30. He asked the girl, who used the alias Sienna, if she liked champagne and added that he wanted to kiss her, the court heard. After arranging to meet by the sea wall, the older male defendant said he attacked the victim because he felt police \"wouldn't have done anything\" if they reported him for trying to meet up with the girl. The girl shouted \"f****** paedophile, I'm f****** 16, get him\" as she filmed the boys chasing Mr Cashford. Mobile phone footage showed the boy striking him on the head with a bottle. He accepted he wanted to use it to hurt the victim, but said he did not believe it would cause \"serious injury\". Detective Chief Inspector Neil Kimber from Kent Police said Mr Cashford was \"lured to a secluded location\" and there was some \"almost predatory behaviour\" from the two males who followed the victim. \"What we found almost quite macabre is they were keen to post that [attack] on social media only a few minutes after his death,\" he added. Natalie Smith, senior crown prosecutor from the Crown Prosecution Service, said it was a \"carefully pre-planned deliberate and violent attack\" on Mr Cashford \"who could not defend himself\". \"He was first hit from behind with a bottle and despite his best attempts to flee, he was relentlessly pursued and attacked, even when witnesses reported he was lying on the ground.\" Read more from Sky News:Inquest into BGT dancer's deathPensioner was in charge of XL bulliesPrison guard charged over relationship A post-mortem showed Mr Cashford had injuries to his face and head, bruises on his limbs and body, and a number of fractured ribs that had punctured his lung.

        "Content": "Former Pakistani prime minister Imran Khan has not received adequate medical treatment in prison after suffering partial vision loss in one eye, his spokesman claims. Speaking to Sky News' The World with Yalda Hakim, Zulfi Bukhari said Mr Khan's personal doctor has not been allowed to examine the imprisoned former leader, who is said to have lost 85% of vision in his right eye. On Sunday, a \"fully equipped ambulance\" carrying a team of doctors was sent to the prison, but Mr Bukhari questioned why Mr Khan, who has been in prison since August 2023, was not taken to \"an appropriate hospital with the appropriate equipment\". The team of doctors then relayed information to Mr Khan's personal physician, but \"this all still remains in hearsay\", Mr Bukhari said. \"Why are we getting phone calls and just being told reports? Why is his personal doctor not allowed to be present? Or at the very least, see him now after they've done the check-up? The same goes for any family member,\" he questioned. Mr Khan, 73, has been in isolation at the Adiala prison for about 90 days and has not been able to see his family, Mr Bukhari claimed. \"Why is he being kept in secrecy in isolation? And why is this whole procedure being done in this big secret format, which no one else is allowed to take part in?\" he said, demanding that Mr Khan's personal physician and one family member be allowed to see him. 'Family not informed of surgery' In January, the Pakistani government announced Mr Khan underwent a brief procedure at a hospital in Islamabad for his eye condition. Mr Khan's family or his legal team were never informed of his eye conditions, Mr Bukhari said, adding this was \"a basic right for a prisoner\". Pakistan's Supreme Court allowed his lawyer, Salman Safdar, to see him in prison, after which Mr Safdar told the court about Mr Khan's vision loss, resulting in the court ordering a medical assessment by a panel of doctors. Supporters of Mr Khan's Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf party (PTI) have staged protests in Islamabad and other cities, demanding that the former prime minister be moved from prison to a hospital for specialised treatment for his eye condition. Cabinet minister Tariq Fazal Chaudhry wrote on X on Monday that a detailed medical examination of Khan was performed inside the prison, and doctors concluded Mr Khan's eyesight had improved and \"no major complications have emerged\". Dr Aasim Yusuf, Mr Khan's personal physician, said on X that the team of eye specialists treating Mr Khan had told him about an \"improvement\" in his eyesight, but he could not confirm or deny this assessment as he has not been allowed to see or examine Mr Khan himself. 'Inhumane to stop family from seeing him' The Supreme Court also ordered a phone call between Mr Khan and his sons. Sulaiman and Kasim Khan told Yalda Hakim in December that they had not spoken to their father for months and fear they might never see their father again, as he is being \"psychologically tortured\" in a \"death cell\". They were allowed to speak to him for 20 minutes over the weekend, Mr Bukhari said. Mr Khan's sister, Aleema Khan, wrote on X on Saturday that her brother was \"extremely happy\" to hear his sons' voices after a long gap. But his sons' visas to visit their father in the Pakistani prison keep being delayed. \"I mean, not granting them a visa is, is ridiculous. It's an online system. The basic things are there, whose kids they are, where they were, why they're coming, where they're staying, all of that,\" Mr Bukhari claimed. \"So denying them a visa to go see their father, who's been in prison and they haven't seen him for probably three odd years, is just inhumane. They haven't outright rejected it, but they keep saying there's some technical issue.\" 'It is ripping the country apart' While Mr Khan is in prison, Pakistan was \"deteriorating\", Mr Bukhari said, \"but the focus is just on how do we keep Imran Khan caged away, so no one can see him, no one can hear him, and no one can speak to him, and he should not be able to get anything out in the public\". He said this was \"ripping the country apart\". Mr Khan has been in jail since his August 2023 arrest after he was handed a three-year prison term for illegally selling state gifts. In January, he was handed a 14-year sentence in a corruption case, and in December, he was sentenced to 17 years in prison for buying state gifts at a knock-down price. The former leader was convicted in a string of cases that he says were politically driven following his ousting in a 2022 parliamentary vote. When asked whether Mr Khan believed that he would be released from jail someday, Mr Bukhari replied: \"He would be thinking that he is not only going to come out of jail one day, he is also going to come out and lead the country the way it's supposed to be led one day.\" Read more from Sky News:Train derails after suspected avalancheMan charged over concert terror attack plot He added he did not think Mr Khan was delusional, as \"he's always succeeded in whatever he put his vision towards\". Mr Khan said: \"He's always made it, he's always done it against all odds, and I don't see how this is going to be any different.\" Sky News has contacted the Pakistani government for comment. Before launching his political career, Mr Khan was best known as a star of international cricket and for leading Pakistan to Cricket World Cup victory in 1992."

        "Headline": "Thirty councils had delayed their elections until next year after the government asked them to - but they now have three months to prepare.",
        "Content": "The government has abandoned plans to postpone 30 local elections in May following legal advice. Labour announced in December it was planning to cancel elections in 30 areas - affecting more than 4.5 million people - to overhaul English council structures. But on Monday, the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government (MHCLG) said it was no longer going ahead with the plan due to \"new legal advice\". Politics latest: Which councils are affected? Reform UK had launched a legal challenge against the government, and the legal advice was in reaction to that case. A letter from the government's legal department to MHCLG, seen by Sky News, said the government will pay Reform's legal costs. Sky News understands the legal costs are in six figures. An MHCLG spokesman said: \"Following legal advice, the government has withdrawn its original decision to postpone 30 local elections in May. \"Providing certainty to councils about their local elections is now the most crucial thing and all local elections will now go ahead in May 2026.\" The department has written to all 30 councils to confirm elections will go ahead in May. There will also be a £63m fund to help local councils across those areas reorganise their structures, with \"practical support\" also on offer. Reform UK's leader Nigel Farage told broadcasters that the government had \"caved\". \"It's a victory for Reform. But more importantly, it's a victory for democracy in this country. We are delighted,\" he said. He added that the government had U-turned because they would have lost in court - and suggested Local Government Secretary Steve Reed's job should be at risk. U-turn number 15 This is now the 15th U-turn by Sir Keir's government since coming to power in July 2024. Less than two hours before the announcement, the prime minister was asked by the BBC if he would \"stick to your course now after those U-turns\". He responded: \"Absolutely. I know exactly why I was elected in with a five-year mandate to change this country for the better, and that's what I intend to do.\" Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch called the U-turn \"predictable chaos from a useless government that cannot make basic decisions\". Most of the councils that had chosen to postpone, after being invited to by the government in December, were Labour - and Ms Badenoch called the few Conservative-run authorities to choose postponement \"silly\". She said Mr Reed now has \"very serious questions to answer on whether political considerations were behind his decision\" - and she threatened to use \"every means at our disposal to get to the truth\" if he does not. Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey said they \"cannot allow the government to cancel elections on a whim ever again\", and said his party wanted to change the law to strip ministers of that power. Councils and voters 'bewildered' Campaigners expressed relief at this latest U-turn but also exasperation over how little time councils now have to put on elections in less than three months. Elliot Keck, campaigns director of the TaxPayers' Alliance, said: \"Taxpayers will be hugely relieved to see their right to a vote restored, but it should have never come this far. \"Millions of voters were not just facing cancelled elections, but also the double injustice of increased council tax despite a complete lack of a democratic mandate. \"Ministers should still bring in new guidelines making clear that were any elections to be cancelled in future, for any reason, there would be a mandatory freeze on council tax and any other charges.\" Read more:PM pledges social media crackdown'Mutinous mood' at UK's Foreign Office The District Councils' Network, which represents 169 English councils, said councils and voters \"will be bewildered by the unrelenting changes to the electoral timetable\". Richard Wright, chair of the DCN, added: \"Councils were assured by the government that elections could be legally cancelled but now it seems ministers have come to the opposite conclusion. \"The councils affected face an unnecessary race against time to ensure elections proceed smoothly and fairly, with polling stations booked and electoral staff available.\""

        "Content": "\n          Political correspondent\n              @MhariAurora\n The government has changed its mind again. By my count, for the 15th time. The government planned to postpone local elections in 30 areas of England due to take place in May, but after a court challenge from Reform UK, it thought better of it. With government lawyers offering new legal advice saying the proposed cancellation of these elections would, in fact, be illegal, this means that over 4 and a half million extra people will be voting in May after all. But why did the government want to cancel these elections? Labour argued that it was a waste of time, money and resources to hold elections for councils that would soon be abolished and merged into larger council structures anyway. But that justification appeared not to be legally robust enough to reassure the government that it could win the legal case. And not only has the government scrapped these plans, but it also now has to scrap planned legislation it created to make these changes possible. And what's more, it has agreed to pay Reform's legal fees - something Sky News understands to be a six-figure sum. Read more:Every Labour U-turn in 19 monthsInvestigation launched into Labour campaign group claim Opposition parties are celebrating this U-turn as a victory for democracy.

But by our maths at Sky News, this makes it U-turn number 15. And with even more councils and council seats up for grabs in May than first thought, Sir Keir has even more to lose."

        "Content": "A nine-year-old boy has become the first patient to have pioneering leg-lengthening surgery in the UK. Alfie Phillips, from Northampton, has fibular hemimelia, a rare condition that affects fewer than one in 40,000 births in the UK each year. It caused his right leg not to develop properly, leaving it about four centimetres shorter than his left. According to specialists, it would have grown to be six centimetres shorter by the time he was 16. Speaking to the Press Association (PA), Alfie said his schoolmates used to say \"I ran a bit different, and I couldn't skip\", and that by the time he was five, \"it started to get a bit annoying\". \"If they ever wanted a conversation, other than my friends, it was always going to be about my condition,\" he added. \"When I was obviously a lot younger, I didn't think it was any different because I grew up with it.\" The operation explained Doctors were able to extend Alfie's leg by installing a lengthening nail on the surface of his thigh bone. This was then slowly pulled apart by a special magnet, used three times a day for a month, with the body creating new bone tissue to fill the gap. Procedures using lengthening nails - fitted inside the bone - were not previously available to younger children due to the risk of damage. But before the operation at Alder Hey Children's Hospital in Liverpool, Alfie's only option for treatment was to have an external frame fixed to his bone from the outside of his limb. Treatment started in March last year. Almost a year on, Alfie said he's feeling good and enjoys being taller than his friends. \"I can just tower over them now… I like doing basketball a lot,\" he said. 'That leg difference became a lot more significant' Laura Ducker, Alfie's mum, told PA her son was diagnosed with fibular hemimelia within six months being born. His father first raised concerns when he noticed his son only had three toes on one foot, but Alfie met all his milestones as a baby as expected. Ms Ducker, who is an NHS midwife, said while \"it really didn't affect him massively when he was little\", as he got older, \"that leg difference became a lot more significant\". There was a risk it could cause problems with Alfie's hips and joints, she said, and so sought advice from Alder Hey's consultant orthopaedic surgeon Nick Peterson after hearing about him on a Facebook support group. Read more from Sky News:New weather warnings for snow and iceObama says aliens 'are real'Royal Mail warns of service delays 'Unheard of' recovery Describing Alfie's recovery, Mr Peterson told PA his team was left \"amazed\" by Alfie's rapid recovery. \"After about seven days, his pain score went down to zero out of 10, which is pretty much unheard of,\" he said. \"He didn't require anything other than the occasional paracetamol after a few days, and that was it. That is extremely unusual. \"So his recovery was remarkably quick and really, really impressive.\""

        "Content": "\n          Science correspondent\n              @SkyNewsThomas\n Parts of Britain could be at risk of further flooding for months to come because so much rain has fallen so far this year, according to new analysis. Latest official figures from the UK Centre for Ecology and Hydrology (UKCEH) show rivers in the south and southwest of England reached exceptionally high levels in January, with some breaking records. And the soil is so saturated in areas that have borne the brunt of the deluge that water is rising up through the ground - an invisible threat that could suddenly flood homes. The Environment Agency (EA) has also warned of a significant risk of so-called groundwater flooding that could persist for months. Mark Garratt, flood duty manager at the agency, said: \"Significant groundwater flooding impacts are probable in parts of Dorset and Wiltshire, with minor groundwater impacts probable in Hampshire and West Sussex. \"Due to steadily rising levels, minor groundwater flooding impacts are possible in Kent and East Sussex.\" Check the weather forecast in your area The monthly statistics from the UKCEH confirm that Northern Ireland and the southwest of England had their wettest January on record, with 170% of their normal rainfall. It was also one of the five wettest Januarys since 1890 for southern counties of England. River levels in the affected areas surged as a result, with three reaching their highest flows for January, and two setting a record. Monitoring at boreholes across Dorset, Wiltshire, Hampshire, Sussex, and Kent also showed that groundwater levels at 29 sites were above normal. At 28 sites levels were so high that there was a risk of flooding from water rising from beneath people's homes. And at 10 sites levels had reached their highest on record. Groundwater flooding 'can take people by surprise' Professor Hannah Cloke, a world-leading hydrologist at Reading University, told Sky News: \"Groundwater flooding is invisible. It comes up through the floorboards. It seeps out in the middle of the night, and people aren't expecting it. \"It's not like you're living near to a river, and you expect that flooding. So it can be very serious. It can take people by surprise. \"And it is very persistent. It can last for a long time. So this could last for months in some of these places.\" Read more from Sky News:PM abandons plans to delay council electionsPolice using drones to catch phone thieves According to the Met Office, the jet stream is lying further south than normal for the time of year. The high altitude winds have also been supercharged by cold weather in North America, generating bands of persistent rain that have lingered over parts of the UK. Further rain is forecast and the EA has urged people to stay alert to flood warnings."

        "Content": "Two teenagers have been found guilty of killing a man at a seaside resort after he arranged to meet a 16-year-old girl. A girl and two boys, who are aged 15 and 16, and cannot be named for legal reasons, had been on trial for the murder of Alexander Cashford in Leysdown-on-Sea, on the Isle of Sheppey, Kent, on 10 August last year. The girl and the 15-year-old boy had denied manslaughter but were found guilty by a jury at Woolwich Crown Court, while a 16-year-old boy previously pleaded guilty to the same offence. All three were acquitted of murder. The court heard how the teenagers thought Mr Cashford, 49, was a paedophile and lured him to a beach before hitting him with rocks and a bottle. He was found lying face down in the mud. Jurors were told the victim had given the girl his number on 8 August after meeting her at an amusement arcade and had handed her a business card, which included a name that was not his. The three exchanged messages with Mr Cashford, who claimed to be 30. He asked the girl, who used the alias Sienna, if she liked champagne and added that he wanted to kiss her, the court heard. After arranging to meet by the sea wall, the older male defendant said he attacked the victim because he felt police \"wouldn't have done anything\" if they reported him for trying to meet up with the girl. The girl shouted \"f****** paedophile, I'm f****** 16, get him\" as she filmed the boys chasing Mr Cashford. Mobile phone footage showed the boy striking him on the head with a bottle. He accepted he wanted to use it to hurt the victim, but said he did not believe it would cause \"serious injury\". Detective Chief Inspector Neil Kimber from Kent Police said Mr Cashford was \"lured to a secluded location\" and there was some \"almost predatory behaviour\" from the two males who followed the victim. \"What we found almost quite macabre is they were keen to post that [attack] on social media only a few minutes after his death,\" he added. Natalie Smith, senior crown prosecutor from the Crown Prosecution Service, said it was a \"carefully pre-planned deliberate and violent attack\" on Mr Cashford \"who could not defend himself\". \"He was first hit from behind with a bottle and despite his best attempts to flee, he was relentlessly pursued and attacked, even when witnesses reported he was lying on the ground.\" Read more from Sky News:Inquest into BGT dancer's deathPensioner was in charge of XL bulliesPrison guard charged over relationship A post-mortem showed Mr Cashford had injuries to his face and head, bruises on his limbs and body, and a number of fractured ribs that had punctured his lung. The three defendants will be sentenced at a later date, expected to be in April. \"These verdicts will change their lives forever,\" the judge, Mrs Justice Cheema-Grubb, said of the defendants."

Warning: This story contains descriptions some readers may find distressing, including references to suicide. Kerri-Anne Donaldson, who reached the semi-final of the ITV show in 2014 as part of the dance group Kings and Queens, was discovered at her home in Farnborough, Hampshire, on 7 June 2023. Her sister, Cara, described how the night before she was found dead, Ms Donaldson, 38, had said she had made the decision to take her own life. Two days before that, on 4 June, Ms Donaldson was arrested and questioned at a police station about a \"sexual\" offence, which she denied, an inquest held at Winchester heard. After being released, she did not return home, leading her family to report her as a missing person before she was found at a Travelodge hotel in Woking, Surrey. Cara told the hearing that when she arrived there, Ms Donaldson was being taken to hospital in an ambulance having taken an overdose. She said her sister had told an emergency doctor at St Peter's Hospital in north Surrey that she had wanted to kill herself and added: \"I just wanted to hug her.\" Cara said they had not been given any care plan or advice on how to assist her sister when they left the hospital. Cara said she spent the evening with her sister and was reluctant to leave her alone, telling her: \"If you do anything, Kerri, that will always be on my shoulders.\" She added: \"She joked 'I am not going to do that', so I left. One of the last messages was 'Thanks for everything today' and she gave a heart emoji, I just thought she was OK.\" But when her sister did not answer her phone the next morning, Cara said she went to her home and found a note at the top of the stairs which said: \"Call 999, do not come in. I am sorry.\" Cara said she had asked her sister about the allegation and her sister had told her that she was not guilty and that it had \"all been constructed\". Describing her sister, she said: \"Heart of gold, full of fun, brought happiness to life, especially mine, career-driven, adored her family, adored her friends, fantastic dance teacher, everyone loved her.\" The inquest was told of evidence from a post-mortem examination that indicated Ms Donaldson had taken her own life.

        "Content": "A pensioner with limited mobility was left in charge of 10 XL bullies before she was killed, a court has heard. Ashley Warren is on trial at Chelmsford Crown Court, accused of owning or being in charge of two XL bully dogs that killed 68-year-old Esther Martin. Warren, 41, left Ms Martin with the two dogs, named Beauty and Bear, and eight puppies at his home on Hillman Avenue in Jaywick, Essex, on 3 February 2024. Jurors previously heard the aspiring rapper had asked Ms Martin, who was 5ft 3in, to look after the dogs so he could travel to London to film a music video. Summing up the case on Monday, prosecutor Chris Paxton KC said Ms Martin had \"restricted\" movement after a hip replacement, and arthritis and a limp. This meant it was a \"ludicrous suggestion\" to say she could be deemed a \"fit and proper person\" to control the dogs. He said the pack's combined weight was between 180kg to 190kg, describing the dogs as \"unpredictable, towering, muscular\" animals. \"In old money, that's about 26 to 28 stone, not of static Roman statues but living, writhing, fighting dogs. Dogs described by the defendant as 'bouncy',\" he added. The two adult dogs weighed 39kg and 47kg, and each of the eight puppies were between 10kg to 12kg, the court heard. Warren had known Ms Martin for more than 12 years, so he would have been aware she had mobility issues and had \"no basis\" to believe she could \"physically stop the dogs\", Mr Paxton said. Read more from Sky News:New weather warnings for snow and ice issuedProducer of hit TV spy thriller found dead in hotel room He said \"no one could reasonably believe that Esther Martin was a fit and proper person\". \"No one would reasonably believe that Esther could control those dogs with the physicality and power that they clearly possessed, never mind the fact that there was not just one adult XL bully dog but two, with eight puppies in tow. \"Such was the ferocity of the dogs that police officers were unable to enter the home until they had deployed the Tasers, entering not just with Tasers but with shields,\" the prosecutor added. Jurors heard Ms Martin sustained at least 60 mostly dog-related injuries before her death and that the animals had not been walked for four weeks before she was killed. The attack came two days after the government made it a criminal offence to own an XL bully in England and Wales without a certificate of exemption. Warren, now of Addlestone, Surrey, has pleaded not guilty to being the owner of a dog named Bear, which caused injury resulting in death while dangerously out of control in a private place, and to being a person in charge of a dog named Beauty, which did the same. He has also denied possessing a bladed article without good reason or lawful authority at Clacton railway station on 3 February 2024. The defendant sat in the dock with his head bowed during Monday's hearing. The trial continues."

        "Content": "Former Pakistani prime minister Imran Khan has not received adequate medical treatment in prison after suffering partial vision loss in one eye, his spokesman claims. Speaking to Sky News' The World with Yalda Hakim, Zulfi Bukhari said Mr Khan's personal doctor has not been allowed to examine the imprisoned former leader, who is said to have lost 85% of vision in his right eye. On Sunday, a \"fully equipped ambulance\" carrying a team of doctors was sent to the prison, but Mr Bukhari questioned why Mr Khan, who has been in prison since August 2023, was not taken to \"an appropriate hospital with the appropriate equipment\". The team of doctors then relayed information to Mr Khan's personal physician, but \"this all still remains in hearsay\", Mr Bukhari said. \"Why are we getting phone calls and just being told reports? Why is his personal doctor not allowed to be present? Or at the very least, see him now after they've done the check-up? The same goes for any family member,\" he questioned. Mr Khan, 73, has been in isolation at the Adiala prison for about 90 days and has not been able to see his family, Mr Bukhari claimed. \"Why is he being kept in secrecy in isolation? And why is this whole procedure being done in this big secret format, which no one else is allowed to take part in?\" he said, demanding that Mr Khan's personal physician and one family member be allowed to see him. 'Family not informed of surgery' In January, the Pakistani government announced Mr Khan underwent a brief procedure at a hospital in Islamabad for his eye condition. Mr Khan's family or his legal team were never informed of his eye conditions, Mr Bukhari said, adding this was \"a basic right for a prisoner\". Pakistan's Supreme Court allowed his lawyer, Salman Safdar, to see him in prison, after which Mr Safdar told the court about Mr Khan's vision loss, resulting in the court ordering a medical assessment by a panel of doctors. Supporters of Mr Khan's Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf party (PTI) have staged protests in Islamabad and other cities, demanding that the former prime minister be moved from prison to a hospital for specialised treatment for his eye condition. Cabinet minister Tariq Fazal Chaudhry wrote on X on Monday that a detailed medical examination of Khan was performed inside the prison, and doctors concluded Mr Khan's eyesight had improved and \"no major complications have emerged\". Dr Aasim Yusuf, Mr Khan's personal physician, said on X that the team of eye specialists treating Mr Khan had told him about an \"improvement\" in his eyesight, but he could not confirm or deny this assessment as he has not been allowed to see or examine Mr Khan himself. 'Inhumane to stop family from seeing him' The Supreme Court also ordered a phone call between Mr Khan and his sons. Sulaiman and Kasim Khan told Yalda Hakim in December that they had not spoken to their father for months and fear they might never see their father again, as he is being \"psychologically tortured\" in a \"death cell\". They were allowed to speak to him for 20 minutes over the weekend, Mr Bukhari said. Mr Khan's sister, Aleema Khan, wrote on X on Saturday that her brother was \"extremely happy\" to hear his sons' voices after a long gap. But his sons' visas to visit their father in the Pakistani prison keep being delayed. \"I mean, not granting them a visa is, is ridiculous. It's an online system. The basic things are there, whose kids they are, where they were, why they're coming, where they're staying, all of that,\" Mr Bukhari claimed. \"So denying them a visa to go see their father, who's been in prison and they haven't seen him for probably three odd years, is just inhumane. They haven't outright rejected it, but they keep saying there's some technical issue.\" 'It is ripping the country apart' While Mr Khan is in prison, Pakistan was \"deteriorating\", Mr Bukhari said, \"but the focus is just on how do we keep Imran Khan caged away, so no one can see him, no one can hear him, and no one can speak to him, and he should not be able to get anything out in the public\". He said this was \"ripping the country apart\". Mr Khan has been in jail since his August 2023 arrest after he was handed a three-year prison term for illegally selling state gifts. In January, he was handed a 14-year sentence in a corruption case, and in December, he was sentenced to 17 years in prison for buying state gifts at a knock-down price. The former leader was convicted in a string of cases that he says were politically driven following his ousting in a 2022 parliamentary vote. When asked whether Mr Khan believed that he would be released from jail someday, Mr Bukhari replied: \"He would be thinking that he is not only going to come out of jail one day, he is also going to come out and lead the country the way it's supposed to be led one day.\" Read more from Sky News:Train derails after suspected avalancheMan charged over concert terror attack plot He added he did not think Mr Khan was delusional, as \"he's always succeeded in whatever he put his vision towards\". Mr Khan said: \"He's always made it, he's always done it against all odds, and I don't see how this is going to be any different.\" Sky News has contacted the Pakistani government for comment. Before launching his political career, Mr Khan was best known as a star of international cricket and for leading Pakistan to Cricket World Cup victory in 1992."

She's telling me the painful details of the day her nephew, Hooman, was killed during recent protests in Iran. The 37-year-old had joined demonstrations against the regime in Lahijan, in the north of the country, when his family says he was fatally shot by government forces in early January. \"Hooman took to the streets without a weapon. He didn't even have a small rock in his pockets to defend himself, but he was shot with a military bullet,\" his aunt says. Her distress is palpable. Throughout the interview she oscillates between heartbreak and utter exhaustion at her powerlessness. Now living in Germany, Nasrin explains it isn't safe for her to return to Iran so she cannot hold her family as they grieve. All she has left of Hooman is a framed photo which she kisses as she cries. Following her nephew's death, she explains his relatives went to collect his body but were told it had been moved to the city of Rasht, a place where authorities are also accused of a violent crackdown on protesters. Nasrin says a friend in the city told her the bazaar was set on fire and when protesters ran from the flames, security forces opened fire. After the blaze, government-backed Iranian state TV aired drone footage of the aftermath which it said showed the scene \"three days after the terrorist incident of the Rasht bazaar fire\". Nasrin says when her family finally arrived at the place where Hooman's body was being stored many other grieving families were already there. \"They saw so many people crying, all screaming, suffering in every way possible,\" she explains. \"There were several containers. They said the body was in the containers. When they opened the doors, there were several corpses stacked on top of each other. They had to look for their son.\" She claims her relatives were told to bury Hooman immediately and had to sign a document when they left saying that they couldn't talk about what had happened. \"They had to pay money for the bullet that killed their son,\" she adds. Hooman had been married for three years when he died. His young wife is now a widow. In a post on social media his friend said an hour before Hooman was shot, he'd said if he didn't return, he'd died so others could be free. \"Who do you think is responsible for his death?\" I ask Nasrin. \"The Iranian government, the Mullahs. They're all murderers, they all have the blood of the Iranian people on their hands,\" she quickly replies. \"They shoot the young people and then they demand money for the bullet. Are these the people in power or are they murderers?\" she adds.

'I have no hope about Donald Trump' Following the crackdown, US President Donald Trump has sent warships towards Iran and repeatedly threatened to use force to make the country reach a deal on its nuclear programme, but Nasrin says it's not enough. \"I have no hope about Donald Trump. They could already help many other Iranian people. They could do sanctions,\" she says. \"The people of Iran can get rid of this government, but we need to help them. They don't need war.\" I ask whether she would support foreign powers going into the country to overturn the regime, or if she believes lasting change can only happen from within. \"From within,\" she replies. \"From outside, they just want war, they want to destroy our country. We don't want that.\" Powerless to push for change inside Iran - Nasrin has joined thousands of other Iranians at protests in Germany demanding democracy and justice for the dead; both demands may fail. Sky News put the allegations made against the Iranian regime in this interview to the Iranian Embassy in London. At the time of publication, we had not received a reply."

        "Content": "Australia's prime minister insists his country will not accept women and children from a camp housing people with alleged ties to Islamic State, after Syrian officials attempted to repatriate them. On Monday, 34 women and children from 11 families were supposed to make their way from Al Roj camp to the Syrian capital, Damascus, and then fly to Australia. But they were returned to the camp after Syrian officials said the procedures for their departure were not complete, and they would not be able to travel. When asked about the attempt to repatriate them, Australian ‌Prime Minister Anthony Albanese ‌told ABC News, \"we won't repatriate them\". He added: \"My mother would have said, 'if you make your bed, you lie in it'. These are people who went overseas supporting Islamic State and went there to provide support for people who basically want a caliphate. \"We have a very firm view that we won't be providing assistance or repatriation.\" Arguably, the most well-known resident of Al Roj camp, also known as Roj camp, is Shamima Begum.

She has lost an appeal against the British government's decision to revoke her UK citizenship. In November, a counterterrorism review called for Begum and other British-linked people in Syria to be repatriated, calling the UK an \"outlier\" in its policy towards such citizens Hakmiyeh Ibrahim, the camp's director, said Monday's planned repatriations were organised by family members of the returnees and not directly with Australian authorities.

Most in the camp are not technically prisoners and have not been accused of a crime, but they have, in effect, been detained in the heavily guarded camp, controlled by the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces. During an interview with ABC News, Mr Albanese ‌hinted at potential consequences if people returned: \"We want to make it clear... to the people involved that, if there are any breaches of the law, then they will face the full force of the Australian law.\" The fate of the Al Roj camp and the similar but larger Al Hol camp has been a matter of debate for years. Human rights groups have cited poor living conditions and pervasive violence in the camps, but many countries have been reluctant to take back their citizens who are detained there. Mr Ibrahim, the camp director, said 16 families were repatriated last year, including German, British and French nationals. In 2022, three Australian families were repatriated."

The group is separate from but closely allied with Afghanistan's Taliban who returned to power in 2021.

The Oscar-winning actor and filmmaker died peacefully at home on Sunday, his wife Luciana said, in a statement paying tribute. \"Yesterday we said goodbye to my beloved husband, cherished friend, and one of the greatest actors of our time,\" she said, adding that he \"passed away peacefully at home, surrounded by love and comfort\". \"To the world, he was an Academy Award-winning actor, a director, a storyteller. To me, he was simply everything. His passion for his craft was matched only by his deep love for characters, a great meal, and holding court,\" Luciana said. \"For each of his many roles, Bob gave everything to his characters and to the truth of the human spirit they represented. \"In doing so, he leaves something lasting and unforgettable to us all. Thank you for the years of support you showed Bob and for giving us this time and privacy to celebrate the memories he leaves behind.\" More tributes to Duvalll - including Al Pacino From army man to leading man Duvall grew up in Annapolis, Maryland, the son of a Navy admiral and an amateur actress. After graduating from Principia College in ​Illinois and serving in the US Army, he moved to New York - where he lived with Dustin Hoffman and befriended Gene Hackman when the three were struggling acting students. He appeared in various Broadway and off-Broadway plays, including productions of Arthur Miller's The Crucible and A View From The Bridge, and had TV roles before making his big screen debut in the 1963 adaptation of To Kill A Mockingbird, playing Arthur \"Boo\" Radley. During his prolific career on screen, Duvall created a range of unforgettable characters that made him one of Hollywood's greats. 'One of the best in the world' He earned his first Oscar nomination in the best supporting actor category for playing Mafia consigliere Tom Hagen in 1972's The Godfather - a role he reprised in The Godfather Part II. In 1979, he was nominated in the supporting category once again, this time for his scene-stealing performance as Lieutenant Colonel Bill Kilgore in 1979's Apocalypse Now. Filmmaker Francis Ford Coppola, who directed both films, once described him as being \"one of the four or five best actors in the world\" in an interview with People Magazine. Duvall received seven Academy Award nominations in total - taking home the statuette for best actor in 1984 for Tender Mercies, in which he played a country music star recovering from alcoholism - and was also nominated for eight Golden Globe awards.

The ex-president did not mention Mr Trump by name, but said the \"decorum\" and \"respect for... office\" that used to guide US officials had been lost. Posting a message on Instagram to clear up what he meant by the aliens comments, the 44th president said: \"I was trying to stick with the spirit of the speed round, but since it's gotten attention let me clarify. \"Statistically, the universe is so vast that the odds are good there's life out there. \"But the distances between solar systems are so great that the chances we've been visited by aliens is low, and I saw no evidence during my presidency that extra-terrestrials have made contact with us. Really!\" Read more from Sky News: TV star issues desperate plea to mother's captorUS forces board sanctioned oil tanker During the podcast interview, Mr Obama, 64, also said aliens were not being kept at Area 51, an Air Force base in Nevada. \"There's no underground facility, unless there's this enormous conspiracy and they hid it from the president of the United States,\" Mr Obama said. Mr Cohen then asked what Mr Obama's first question was after becoming president. \"Uh, where are the aliens?\" he quipped. Mr Obama has also previously commented on the possible existence of extra-terrestrial life. During a 2021 appearance on The Late Late Show with James Corden, Mr Obama said that after he took over as president, he sought information on aliens and whether they were being studied in a secret lab. He was told the answer was \"no\". But Mr Obama said officials are seriously investigating aerial phenomena that behave in seemingly unexplainable ways. \"There is footage and records of objects in the skies that we don't know exactly what they are,\" he said. \"We can't explain how they moved, their trajectory. They did not have an easily explainable pattern. I think people still take seriously trying to investigate and figure out what that is.\""

        "Content": "\n          US correspondent\n              @skydavidblevins\n From small-town diners in rural America to glass-panelled newsrooms in the city, it is the question on everyone's lips: where is Nancy Guthrie? The search for the 84-year-old mother of Savannah Guthrie, a national TV host and household name, has entered its third week. What began as a local missing person case has become a ritual watch-and-wait for millions of Americans. Viewers scroll, refresh and share every update - Nancy's warm eyes and gentle smile now achingly familiar. Her family reported her missing when she failed to appear at church on Sunday 1 February. Her car, phone and purse were still at her home, and police found spats of blood there. She doesn't have the mobility she once did, has a pacemaker and takes daily medication for high blood pressure. \n                  Savannah Guthrie issues desperate plea to mother's captor\n                 \n                  FBI releases new details about suspect in Nancy Guthrie disappearance - and increases reward for information\n                 \n                  Why Nancy Guthrie's doorbell footage has led to privacy concerns\n                 Nancy Guthrie: What we know about her disappearance Her daughter, Savannah, anchor of the Today show, pulled out of covering the Winter Olympics and made a heartfelt plea. Seated between her brother and sister, she said they were aware of reports of ransom notes and urged anyone holding their mother to reach out. Just as the trail appeared to be going cold, the FBI retrieved footage from a dismantled door-cam at Nancy's home. The pictures were shocking - a masked individual wearing gloves, a ski mask and carrying a backpack is seen near the front door.

Sheriff Chris Nanos of Pima County, Arizona, later revealed that the clothing and backpack seen in the chilling video were purchased at Walmart. On Sunday, investigators said a glove, found in a field near the side of the road two miles from the home, had been sent off for DNA testing. Donald Trump, who has spoken to Savannah Guthrie by phone, commended the \"expertise and knowledge\" of those working on this case. \"Hopefully, there will be a positive result!\" he posted on Truth Social. But it is Savannah Guthrie, whose professional life has been spent delivering news to others, who has become the face of this personal nightmare. Her public appeals to anyone who might know something to \"do the right thing\" have gripped the nation. People are watching, not because they are obligated to, but because this story touches something universal: the ache of not knowing."

The Guthrie family are victims plain and simple.\" It comes as the case involving the mother of Today show co-anchor Savannah Guthrie entered its third week. On Sunday, investigators said they had obtained a DNA sample from a glove found near the Arizona home of Nancy, 84, which appears to match the pair worn by a masked prowler seen in doorbell camera footage before she was abducted. Nancy was last seen on 31 January when her family dropped her off at her home near Tucson following dinner with them. Relatives reported her missing the following day, authorities said. Mr Nanos added that Nancy, who has a pacemaker, was extremely limited in her physical mobility and could not have left her home unassisted, leading investigators to believe she had been taken against her will early on. Since her disappearance, at least two purported ransom notes have surfaced. Both were initially delivered to media outlets, but there has been no known direct contact between Ms Guthrie's presumed captors and her family, or with authorities.

She is described by law enforcement and family members as being in frail health and in need of daily medication to survive. Savannah, 54, is co-anchor of the popular NBC show and has shared several video messages along with her brother, Camron Guthrie and sister, Annie Guthrie. Together, they have been pleading for their mother's return and are appealing for information from the public. Mr Nanos said there had been no proof of life since the abduction but added \"there's not been any proof of death either\". He added that his working assumption is that she remains alive."

        "Content": "\n          International correspondent\n              @sparkomat\n Take a good, hard look at the world and what do you see? It certainly feels unpredictable. Old friends are unreliable, and the rules no longer seem to apply. For many, the global neighbourhood is getting distinctly scary. But don't take my word for it. Listen to the head of UK intelligence agency, MI6. \"The frontline is everywhere,\" says Blaise Metreweli, who used a recent speech to warn of \"the menace of an aggressive, expansionist\" Russia, as well as aggressive and expansionist individuals. Her worries have been restated in remarks made by a host of military leaders. \"The situation is more dangerous than I have known during my career,\" said the chief of the British defence staff Richard Knighton. \"The response requires more than simply strengthening our armed forces.\" The specialists at the Foreign Office - including its embassies and consulates abroad - form a vital part of the country's protective shield - and the woman in charge says she gets it. \n                  Foreign Office has been hacked - ministers 'fairly confident' individual data not at risk\n                 \n                  The families of British citizens detained abroad have called for more support\n                 \n                  UK summons Russian ambassador over 'utterly unacceptable' violations into NATO airspace\n                 Foreign Secretary Yvette Cooper has announced the formation of a \"state threats unit\" along with other initiatives to protect Britain in a world of \"escalating hybrid threats\". What senior officials are not talking about, however, are government plans to slash the workforce charged with countering these dangers. The Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (to use its full name) will be transformed under a new restructuring plan called FCDO 2030. The process will result in approximately 2,000 job losses, or up to 25% of its total workforce - with fears of a jaw-dropping reduction of up to 40% in some London-based departments. \"The mood in some departments is despondent, even mutinous. (There is) very little trust in senior leadership of this organisation,\" said one employee. Another compared the atmosphere at the Foreign Office to the dystopian film The Hunger Games, with staff forced to compete for dwindling number of positions. The PCS trade union, which represents employees at the Foreign Office, described the situation as \"a mess\". \"We've seen no justification for these cuts and have yet to be told what work has been deemed disposable by senior leadership,\" said a PCS official. Curiously, those senior leaders - including the minister in charge of international development - have made it clear that they will be relying on the expertise of their own staff as they try to navigate massive funding cuts to programmes in the international aid budget. \"The shift from grants - to expertise is quite fundamental,\" announced development minister Baroness Chapman, to the members of a parliamentary committee. \"Our influence is not about the size of our (direct spending) programme... but it is much more about our diplomatic work, our political connections, the role we play in the multilateral space.\" The multilateral space is getting seriously challenging. Britain can no longer band together with members of the EU - nor lean on its relationship with the US - to get what it wants. Instead, it has to scrap for power and influence on its own. The man effectively driving these cuts, permanent under-secretary Sir Oliver Robbins, told MPs that he is following a mandate set by former foreign secretary David Lammy, who viewed the Foreign Office as unfocused, top heavy and \"not sufficiently strategic\". Yet Robbins seemed to accept in discussions with MPs that some of the best people would bolt. \"We are working incredibly hard to try to make sure that we hang on to as much of what I agree is the extremely experienced talent that we need, at various degrees of seniority.\" The job losses have been greeted with howls of outrage. MPs on the International Development Committee have described the cuts as \"brutal\", and in an interim report, called for the plan to be \"immediately paused\". \"Lives will be put at risk, not to mention the real risk to the UK's global reputation. Once prized FCDO expertise is lost, it will be lost for good,\" said committee chair Sarah Champion. Read more from Sky News:What the Munich Security Conference means for the UKAirstrikes in Gaza kill 11 people, locals say Yet Sky News understands that those criticisms were dismissed at a recent Foreign Office \"Town Hall\" meeting between staff and Robbins. \"It is unheard of to ignore the recommendations of a parliamentary committee like this,\" said an official from the PCS union. Perhaps the most vigorous defence of the country's diplomatic corps has come from a former minister, Rory Stewart, who has been highly critical of the government that he served in. \"In 2015 as we were destroying the Foreign Office and much of our overseas infrastructure, it was pathetic even then, even 10 years ago. The Foreign Office was half the size of the French equivalent. We spend more on Kent County Council than our foreign policy.\" Stewart says the current Labour administration is stumbling down the same dangerous path. \"We are creating a mad world where we have dismantled our soft power and somehow we believe we are going to be able to defend ourselves with a couple of aircraft carriers and nothing to protect them and some big nuclear weapons with nothing to surround them.\" In response to our reporting on FCDO 2030, a Foreign Office spokesperson said: \"The FCDO is transforming to be more agile and focused, so we can deliver for the UK in a rapidly changing world. \"This is part of wider government reforms to deliver for the British people and ensure value for money for the taxpayer, while retaining our world-leading expertise in diplomacy and development.\""

        "Content": "If you've ever spent your morning commute daydreaming about starting afresh with your career, this feature is for you. Each Monday, we speak to someone from a different profession to discover what it's really like. This week we chat Jo Radford, the sommelier at Michelin-starred restaurant Timberyard in Edinburgh. Salary will vary... Depending on the level of the wine professional, maybe somewhere around £30,000-£50,000. I know that in London this can easily rise up to £66,000 before share of tronc [tips and service charge] and bonuses, etc. There is definitely an issue in the industry that lots of people face with substance abuse or looking to drink to numb pain... and avoid dealing with other parts of life. That was the case for me at least. I've been working in wine for 15 years now but I've been sober for over six years. I talk very liberally about it with people who have asked. It's important to break the stigma around alcohol in the drinks business. Follow the latest consumer news here Hospitality is finally catching up with other industries in terms of work-life balance... Previously, people working in restaurants and bars were working more hours, longer days and more days of the week. In the last five years there has been a shift back to work-life balance. The vast majority of sommeliers are wine professionals in the 40-45 hour bracket, which is fairly standard. I now work as a sober sommelier... and am still able to build out wine lists without drinking the wines themselves. There are other sober sommeliers in this country and around the world, but not many people know about them, and there is still a misconception that you can't do this job unless you drink. Lots of people are also struggling with alcohol abuse and don't feel like they're in a position to talk about it, so hopefully sharing my story can help change that. So now, I taste and spit, and I'm fairly certain my palate has never been sharper. For more information about how we use your data and your rights, you can visit our Privacy Centre. Feeling the way the slopes align... when the sun comes up in the morning, or seeing first-hand the influence of the mountains on the vines - that all deepens your understanding of a region and the wine it produces. You can't get a proper gauge on these things until you've visited the vineyard or the cellar, or listened to the winemaker tell the story of the vineyard and talk about their craft. \n                  'The market is on fire': Major lenders rush to slash rates for first-time buyers | Money blog\n                 \n                  Mark Kleinman blog | See the latest stories from Sky News' City editor\n                 \n                  Ex-Carillion boss fined £237,700 by regulator for 'reckless' behaviour\n                 A wine region/country that is underrated and not spoken about enough is... probably Georgia. I was very fortunate to travel there last May, and it was a big eye-opener of a trip, not just because of the wine culture there but because it was the birthplace of wine, with records dating back thousands and thousands of years. The wines there are so unique and offer a snapshot into times past. It was a war-torn country right on the cross-section of Europe, so you have influences from the war, the spice routes, etc. One tip for pairing wine with food is... look at what's near and dear from a wine perspective. By this, I mean marry the food with wines from that region. By and large, wherever the dish originated from, or the ingredients are predominantly from, is a good place to start in terms of looking for a wine to pair. By and large, the more you're willing to spend, the better value the bottle you usually get... Margins are tapered, so those near the very south of the list (more commonly recognised) have the biggest markup. It all depends on the volume of the bottles being ordered - whether affordable or crowd pleasing - these wines have higher margins. The ones with lower margins tend to be slow movers on wine lists. There's an economy that comes into play and so there's more opportunity for getting better value the more money you spend. There are mark-ups on wines in restaurants... but it's all the other overheads you need to take into consideration that a supermarket doesn't have to take care of. The purchasing of the wine is the same, but on top of that, restaurants have to factor in storage, sorting the wines, printing wine lists, holding back bottles to age, the cost of service, cleaning of glasses, etc. Then you've got to consider how the wines are presented, the rent of the space, heating, lighting and the curation of an atmosphere. In the last few years, restaurateurs have responded to customers with breakdowns of costs, so you can actually see what they're making in terms of profit (which often is very little). Three tips for navigating the wine list…  1) Engage with the staff and ask for guidance; 2) Have a rough indication of budget in mind; 3) Don't be scared of the unknown - this allows you to find more interesting options that are potentially better value too. With tricky customers, I... kill them with kindness. But also try to meet them on their level. Certain people have certain likes and dislikes; it's important to understand what these are and find something that fits. The most classic fault to look for when identifying an off wine is... cork taint, and it's usually fairly obvious from a damp, wet, cardboard aroma. I always trust my first instinct; it's the easiest way to tell if a wine is good to drink. If it doesn't feel right to you from the start, then it's probably not. When you're asked to taste the wine... it's to see whether it's faulty, not whether you like it. Some restaurants can be a bit funny about guests returning wine that isn't faulty, but because they don't like it. But the money hasn't just gone to waste if the bottle is returned from the table, sometimes we take a bottle back and work it into a wine pairing or use it for training the team. We usually try to cover the costs of the bottle with sales by the glass and move on.

Rivals circle as chicken shops boom in UK The biggest mistake people make when trying wine is... they try to think about too many things at once, but if they like the wine and it makes them feel good, then it's the right wine for them. It's a learning we've borrowed from the whisky industry - lots of people get quite stubborn about the way people should be drinking things, very prescriptive with lots of rules. But at the end of the day, if you want your white wine with ice in it and will enjoy it more that way, then that's fine. You can get very simple hand pumps that help keep opened bottles fresh... and tightly sealing cork stoppers too. You can seal the wine with the latter, and it gives length and longevity to the freshness. You can get more expensive versions of the hand pumps that are electric, but a hand pump has a big impact, and some of them are as little as £15. The hardest part of the job that diners never see... is all the back-of-house bits. Service is the glamorous bit, but in terms of organisation, we have to think about things like cellar or storage space, keeping wine lists up to date, co-ordinating deliveries, checking vintages are right, checking the right bottles have been dropped off, categorising them correctly and making sure they're stored correctly. There's a lot to juggle. In the supermarket... try to search for the humble Vin de France, Vino Bianco/Rosso. These wines may not come with a storied appellation written on the label, but you can often find exceptional value for money from emerging regions and producers who are eschewing the need for an appellation-stamp-of-approval. The only thing that is a little intimidating is... the idea that wine knowledge is a never ending pursuit. No one can ever really conquer the craft of wine in this industry. Just when you think you're getting close, there are new vintages to get your head around, new producers to meet, new climatic changes to consider. It feels a little relentless but it's good fun."

        "Headline": "Thirty councils had delayed their elections until next year after the government asked them to - but they now have three months to prepare.",
        "Content": "The government has abandoned plans to postpone 30 local elections in May following legal advice. Labour announced in December it was planning to cancel elections in 30 areas - affecting more than 4.5 million people - to overhaul English council structures. But on Monday, the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government (MHCLG) said it was no longer going ahead with the plan due to \"new legal advice\". Politics latest: Which councils are affected? Reform UK had launched a legal challenge against the government, and the legal advice was in reaction to that case. A letter from the government's legal department to MHCLG, seen by Sky News, said the government will pay Reform's legal costs. Sky News understands the legal costs are in six figures. An MHCLG spokesman said: \"Following legal advice, the government has withdrawn its original decision to postpone 30 local elections in May. \"Providing certainty to councils about their local elections is now the most crucial thing and all local elections will now go ahead in May 2026.\" The department has written to all 30 councils to confirm elections will go ahead in May. There will also be a £63m fund to help local councils across those areas reorganise their structures, with \"practical support\" also on offer. Reform UK's leader Nigel Farage told broadcasters that the government had \"caved\". \"It's a victory for Reform. But more importantly, it's a victory for democracy in this country. We are delighted,\" he said. He added that the government had U-turned because they would have lost in court - and suggested Local Government Secretary Steve Reed's job should be at risk. U-turn number 15 This is now the 15th U-turn by Sir Keir's government since coming to power in July 2024. Less than two hours before the announcement, the prime minister was asked by the BBC if he would \"stick to your course now after those U-turns\". He responded: \"Absolutely. I know exactly why I was elected in with a five-year mandate to change this country for the better, and that's what I intend to do.\" Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch called the U-turn \"predictable chaos from a useless government that cannot make basic decisions\". Most of the councils that had chosen to postpone, after being invited to by the government in December, were Labour - and Ms Badenoch called the few Conservative-run authorities to choose postponement \"silly\". She said Mr Reed now has \"very serious questions to answer on whether political considerations were behind his decision\" - and she threatened to use \"every means at our disposal to get to the truth\" if he does not. Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey said they \"cannot allow the government to cancel elections on a whim ever again\", and said his party wanted to change the law to strip ministers of that power. Councils and voters 'bewildered' Campaigners expressed relief at this latest U-turn but also exasperation over how little time councils now have to put on elections in less than three months. Elliot Keck, campaigns director of the TaxPayers' Alliance, said: \"Taxpayers will be hugely relieved to see their right to a vote restored, but it should have never come this far. \"Millions of voters were not just facing cancelled elections, but also the double injustice of increased council tax despite a complete lack of a democratic mandate. \"Ministers should still bring in new guidelines making clear that were any elections to be cancelled in future, for any reason, there would be a mandatory freeze on council tax and any other charges.\" Read more:PM pledges social media crackdown'Mutinous mood' at UK's Foreign Office The District Councils' Network, which represents 169 English councils, said councils and voters \"will be bewildered by the unrelenting changes to the electoral timetable\". Richard Wright, chair of the DCN, added: \"Councils were assured by the government that elections could be legally cancelled but now it seems ministers have come to the opposite conclusion. \"The councils affected face an unnecessary race against time to ensure elections proceed smoothly and fairly, with polling stations booked and electoral staff available.\""

        "Content": "\n          Political correspondent\n              @MhariAurora\n The government has changed its mind again. By my count, for the 15th time. The government planned to postpone local elections in 30 areas of England due to take place in May, but after a court challenge from Reform UK, it thought better of it. With government lawyers offering new legal advice saying the proposed cancellation of these elections would, in fact, be illegal, this means that over 4 and a half million extra people will be voting in May after all. But why did the government want to cancel these elections? Labour argued that it was a waste of time, money and resources to hold elections for councils that would soon be abolished and merged into larger council structures anyway. But that justification appeared not to be legally robust enough to reassure the government that it could win the legal case. And not only has the government scrapped these plans, but it also now has to scrap planned legislation it created to make these changes possible. And what's more, it has agreed to pay Reform's legal fees - something Sky News understands to be a six-figure sum. Read more:Every Labour U-turn in 19 monthsInvestigation launched into Labour campaign group claim Opposition parties are celebrating this U-turn as a victory for democracy.

But by our maths at Sky News, this makes it U-turn number 15. And with even more councils and council seats up for grabs in May than first thought, Sir Keir has even more to lose."

The prime minister is trying. Today, he announced the government would close a loophole that meant one-to-one conversations with AI bots weren't regulated in the same way as social media. It's an update to the Online Safety Act that was first shown to Parliament in 2019, more than two years before ChatGPT burst onto the scene and revolutionised how we use the internet. It took until 2023 to be passed and we only saw widespread enforcement in July last year. There are still elements waiting to be enforced.

He also announced a change that means the social media data of young people will be preserved by default if they die, meaning that bereaved families can get answers sooner about their children's deaths. But for the woman who campaigned for that change, Ellen Roome, Mr Starmer still hasn't done enough. Ms Roome began campaigning when her 14-year-old son Jools Sweeney died in 2022, after she believed he attempted a dangerous online challenge.

Prevention before harm matters even more.\" She has repeatedly called for children to be banned from social media. She wants the government to go further than Australia, which recently banned under-16s, and instead wants everyone under 18 years old to be kept from the platforms \"At 16, you're still quite naive and young. I remember thinking I was very mature at 16. Looking back, I really wasn't,\" she told me last year. While it considers this, the government faces a challenge to keep up with the tech industry. If it can't, preventing the deaths of more children will become even more difficult."

        "Content": "\n          International correspondent\n              @sparkomat\n Take a good, hard look at the world and what do you see? It certainly feels unpredictable. Old friends are unreliable, and the rules no longer seem to apply. For many, the global neighbourhood is getting distinctly scary. But don't take my word for it. Listen to the head of UK intelligence agency, MI6. \"The frontline is everywhere,\" says Blaise Metreweli, who used a recent speech to warn of \"the menace of an aggressive, expansionist\" Russia, as well as aggressive and expansionist individuals. Her worries have been restated in remarks made by a host of military leaders. \"The situation is more dangerous than I have known during my career,\" said the chief of the British defence staff Richard Knighton. \"The response requires more than simply strengthening our armed forces.\" The specialists at the Foreign Office - including its embassies and consulates abroad - form a vital part of the country's protective shield - and the woman in charge says she gets it. \n                  Foreign Office has been hacked - ministers 'fairly confident' individual data not at risk\n                 \n                  The families of British citizens detained abroad have called for more support\n                 \n                  UK summons Russian ambassador over 'utterly unacceptable' violations into NATO airspace\n                 Foreign Secretary Yvette Cooper has announced the formation of a \"state threats unit\" along with other initiatives to protect Britain in a world of \"escalating hybrid threats\". What senior officials are not talking about, however, are government plans to slash the workforce charged with countering these dangers. The Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (to use its full name) will be transformed under a new restructuring plan called FCDO 2030. The process will result in approximately 2,000 job losses, or up to 25% of its total workforce - with fears of a jaw-dropping reduction of up to 40% in some London-based departments. \"The mood in some departments is despondent, even mutinous. (There is) very little trust in senior leadership of this organisation,\" said one employee. Another compared the atmosphere at the Foreign Office to the dystopian film The Hunger Games, with staff forced to compete for dwindling number of positions. The PCS trade union, which represents employees at the Foreign Office, described the situation as \"a mess\". \"We've seen no justification for these cuts and have yet to be told what work has been deemed disposable by senior leadership,\" said a PCS official. Curiously, those senior leaders - including the minister in charge of international development - have made it clear that they will be relying on the expertise of their own staff as they try to navigate massive funding cuts to programmes in the international aid budget. \"The shift from grants - to expertise is quite fundamental,\" announced development minister Baroness Chapman, to the members of a parliamentary committee. \"Our influence is not about the size of our (direct spending) programme... but it is much more about our diplomatic work, our political connections, the role we play in the multilateral space.\" The multilateral space is getting seriously challenging. Britain can no longer band together with members of the EU - nor lean on its relationship with the US - to get what it wants. Instead, it has to scrap for power and influence on its own. The man effectively driving these cuts, permanent under-secretary Sir Oliver Robbins, told MPs that he is following a mandate set by former foreign secretary David Lammy, who viewed the Foreign Office as unfocused, top heavy and \"not sufficiently strategic\". Yet Robbins seemed to accept in discussions with MPs that some of the best people would bolt. \"We are working incredibly hard to try to make sure that we hang on to as much of what I agree is the extremely experienced talent that we need, at various degrees of seniority.\" The job losses have been greeted with howls of outrage. MPs on the International Development Committee have described the cuts as \"brutal\", and in an interim report, called for the plan to be \"immediately paused\". \"Lives will be put at risk, not to mention the real risk to the UK's global reputation. Once prized FCDO expertise is lost, it will be lost for good,\" said committee chair Sarah Champion. Read more from Sky News:What the Munich Security Conference means for the UKAirstrikes in Gaza kill 11 people, locals say Yet Sky News understands that those criticisms were dismissed at a recent Foreign Office \"Town Hall\" meeting between staff and Robbins. \"It is unheard of to ignore the recommendations of a parliamentary committee like this,\" said an official from the PCS union. Perhaps the most vigorous defence of the country's diplomatic corps has come from a former minister, Rory Stewart, who has been highly critical of the government that he served in. \"In 2015 as we were destroying the Foreign Office and much of our overseas infrastructure, it was pathetic even then, even 10 years ago. The Foreign Office was half the size of the French equivalent. We spend more on Kent County Council than our foreign policy.\" Stewart says the current Labour administration is stumbling down the same dangerous path. \"We are creating a mad world where we have dismantled our soft power and somehow we believe we are going to be able to defend ourselves with a couple of aircraft carriers and nothing to protect them and some big nuclear weapons with nothing to surround them.\" In response to our reporting on FCDO 2030, a Foreign Office spokesperson said: \"The FCDO is transforming to be more agile and focused, so we can deliver for the UK in a rapidly changing world. \"This is part of wider government reforms to deliver for the British people and ensure value for money for the taxpayer, while retaining our world-leading expertise in diplomacy and development.\""

        "Content": "\n          Science correspondent\n              @SkyNewsThomas\n Parts of Britain could be at risk of further flooding for months to come because so much rain has fallen so far this year, according to new analysis. Latest official figures from the UK Centre for Ecology and Hydrology (UKCEH) show rivers in the south and southwest of England reached exceptionally high levels in January, with some breaking records. And the soil is so saturated in areas that have borne the brunt of the deluge that water is rising up through the ground - an invisible threat that could suddenly flood homes. The Environment Agency (EA) has also warned of a significant risk of so-called groundwater flooding that could persist for months. Mark Garratt, flood duty manager at the agency, said: \"Significant groundwater flooding impacts are probable in parts of Dorset and Wiltshire, with minor groundwater impacts probable in Hampshire and West Sussex. \"Due to steadily rising levels, minor groundwater flooding impacts are possible in Kent and East Sussex.\" Check the weather forecast in your area The monthly statistics from the UKCEH confirm that Northern Ireland and the southwest of England had their wettest January on record, with 170% of their normal rainfall. It was also one of the five wettest Januarys since 1890 for southern counties of England. River levels in the affected areas surged as a result, with three reaching their highest flows for January, and two setting a record. Monitoring at boreholes across Dorset, Wiltshire, Hampshire, Sussex, and Kent also showed that groundwater levels at 29 sites were above normal. At 28 sites levels were so high that there was a risk of flooding from water rising from beneath people's homes. And at 10 sites levels had reached their highest on record. Groundwater flooding 'can take people by surprise' Professor Hannah Cloke, a world-leading hydrologist at Reading University, told Sky News: \"Groundwater flooding is invisible. It comes up through the floorboards. It seeps out in the middle of the night, and people aren't expecting it. \"It's not like you're living near to a river, and you expect that flooding. So it can be very serious. It can take people by surprise. \"And it is very persistent. It can last for a long time. So this could last for months in some of these places.\" Read more from Sky News:PM abandons plans to delay council electionsPolice using drones to catch phone thieves According to the Met Office, the jet stream is lying further south than normal for the time of year. The high altitude winds have also been supercharged by cold weather in North America, generating bands of persistent rain that have lingered over parts of the UK. Further rain is forecast and the EA has urged people to stay alert to flood warnings."

        "Content": "\n          Science and technology reporter\n       Tech moves fast, regulation doesn't - that's what the prime minister is now having to contend with.  People invent new technology like AI, new social media features designed to draw you in, new ways to interact online - and in the background, the authorities scramble to keep up. The prime minister is trying. Today, he announced the government would close a loophole that meant one-to-one conversations with AI bots weren't regulated in the same way as social media. It's an update to the Online Safety Act that was first shown to Parliament in 2019, more than two years before ChatGPT burst onto the scene and revolutionised how we use the internet. It took until 2023 to be passed and we only saw widespread enforcement in July last year. There are still elements waiting to be enforced. During that time, there have been countless AI bots entering the mainstream, from X's Grok, CharacterAI's personalised AI agents, Google's Gemini and more. \n                  Doctors warn of 'horrific' impact of tech and devices on children and young people's health\n                 \n                  Mother suing TikTok over son's death describes 'deeply painful' hearing\n                 \n                  Parents say their children died taking part in viral trend - now they're set to face TikTok in court\n                 Sir Keir Starmer did address the regulatory lag this morning, saying that if a consultation shows a social media ban is the best course of action for the UK, he will now be able to enforce it \"within months, not years\". He also announced a change that means the social media data of young people will be preserved by default if they die, meaning that bereaved families can get answers sooner about their children's deaths. But for the woman who campaigned for that change, Ellen Roome, Mr Starmer still hasn't done enough. Ms Roome began campaigning when her 14-year-old son Jools Sweeney died in 2022, after she believed he attempted a dangerous online challenge. Read more from Sky News:Foreign secretary denies PM is 'rattled'Inside the UK's van dwelling hotspots Since that point, however, she hasn't been able to access his social media data, so she can't confirm her suspicions. This morning, she told me that because of the campaign after her son's death, there'll be \"no more grieving parents having to beg platforms\" and \"no more delays while critical evidence disappears\". \"[But] we must ultimately do more to stop children being harmed or dying in the first place. \"Preservation after death matters. Prevention before harm matters even more.\" She has repeatedly called for children to be banned from social media. She wants the government to go further than Australia, which recently banned under-16s, and instead wants everyone under 18 years old to be kept from the platforms \"At 16, you're still quite naive and young. I remember thinking I was very mature at 16. Looking back, I really wasn't,\" she told me last year. While it considers this, the government faces a challenge to keep up with the tech industry. If it can't, preventing the deaths of more children will become even more difficult."

The Oscar-winning actor and filmmaker died peacefully at home on Sunday, his wife Luciana said, in a statement paying tribute. \"Yesterday we said goodbye to my beloved husband, cherished friend, and one of the greatest actors of our time,\" she said, adding that he \"passed away peacefully at home, surrounded by love and comfort\". \"To the world, he was an Academy Award-winning actor, a director, a storyteller. To me, he was simply everything. His passion for his craft was matched only by his deep love for characters, a great meal, and holding court,\" Luciana said. \"For each of his many roles, Bob gave everything to his characters and to the truth of the human spirit they represented. \"In doing so, he leaves something lasting and unforgettable to us all. Thank you for the years of support you showed Bob and for giving us this time and privacy to celebrate the memories he leaves behind.\" More tributes to Duvalll - including Al Pacino From army man to leading man Duvall grew up in Annapolis, Maryland, the son of a Navy admiral and an amateur actress. After graduating from Principia College in ​Illinois and serving in the US Army, he moved to New York - where he lived with Dustin Hoffman and befriended Gene Hackman when the three were struggling acting students. He appeared in various Broadway and off-Broadway plays, including productions of Arthur Miller's The Crucible and A View From The Bridge, and had TV roles before making his big screen debut in the 1963 adaptation of To Kill A Mockingbird, playing Arthur \"Boo\" Radley. During his prolific career on screen, Duvall created a range of unforgettable characters that made him one of Hollywood's greats. 'One of the best in the world' He earned his first Oscar nomination in the best supporting actor category for playing Mafia consigliere Tom Hagen in 1972's The Godfather - a role he reprised in The Godfather Part II. In 1979, he was nominated in the supporting category once again, this time for his scene-stealing performance as Lieutenant Colonel Bill Kilgore in 1979's Apocalypse Now. Filmmaker Francis Ford Coppola, who directed both films, once described him as being \"one of the four or five best actors in the world\" in an interview with People Magazine. Duvall received seven Academy Award nominations in total - taking home the statuette for best actor in 1984 for Tender Mercies, in which he played a country music star recovering from alcoholism - and was also nominated for eight Golden Globe awards.

On Sunday, investigators said they had obtained a DNA sample from a glove found near the Arizona home of Nancy, 84, which appears to match the pair worn by a masked prowler seen in doorbell camera footage before she was abducted. Nancy was last seen on 31 January when her family dropped her off at her home near Tucson following dinner with them. Relatives reported her missing the following day, authorities said. Mr Nanos added that Nancy, who has a pacemaker, was extremely limited in her physical mobility and could not have left her home unassisted, leading investigators to believe she had been taken against her will early on. Since her disappearance, at least two purported ransom notes have surfaced. Both were initially delivered to media outlets, but there has been no known direct contact between Ms Guthrie's presumed captors and her family, or with authorities.

Savannah, 54, is co-anchor of the popular NBC show and has shared several video messages along with her brother, Camron Guthrie and sister, Annie Guthrie. Together, they have been pleading for their mother's return and are appealing for information from the public. Mr Nanos said there had been no proof of life since the abduction but added \"there's not been any proof of death either\". He added that his working assumption is that she remains alive."

Deep Azure, a play based around the death of Prince Jones, a black student who was killed by a police officer in Virginia in 2000, is premiering in the UK at Shakespeare's Globe Theatre in London. Boseman, who died in 2020, four years after being diagnosed with colon cancer, attended the same university, Howard, in Washington DC, and was inspired to write by the true events. Best known for his starring role in Black Panther, the Oscar nominee also spent a lot of time writing outside of his acting work. The star's brothers Kevin and Derek say director Tristan Fynn-Aiduenu \"fell in love\" with Deep Azure after coming across it a few years ago, and pitched the idea to Shakespeare's Globe. \"It preserves his memory,\" Derek told presenters Anna Jones and Kamali Melbourne on Mornings on Sky News. He said it had taken him years to come to terms with his brother's death. \"This play is absolutely about grief,\" said Kevin. \"It's about love, it's about faith. So, yeah, all of that definitely connects to what we've been through.\" Paying tribute to his brother, Kevin said his happiest memories are of the time they lived together in New York after college. \"My fondest memories really are of us living together, and him experiencing New York City and becoming an artist.\" Deep Azure is inspired by Shakespeare and the poetry of hip-hop, as well as jazz. Boseman's brothers say he always had a passion for theatre and that it is one of several plays he wrote before he died. It follows Azure, whose world spirals out of control after her fiancé Deep is killed by the police.

They did not have an easily explainable pattern. I think people still take seriously trying to investigate and figure out what that is.\""
