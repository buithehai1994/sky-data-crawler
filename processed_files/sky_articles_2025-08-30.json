        "Content": " The Archbishop of York has told Sky News the UK should resist Reform's \"kneejerk\" plan for the mass deportation of migrants, telling Nigel Farage he is not offering any \"long-term solution\". Stephen Cottrell said in an interview with Trevor Phillips he has \"every sympathy\" with people who are concerned about asylum seekers coming to the country illegally. But he criticised the plan announced by Reform on Tuesday to deport 600,000 people, which would be enabled by striking deals with the Taliban and Iran, saying it will not \"solve the problem\". Mr Cottrell is currently acting head of the Church of England while a new Archbishop of Canterbury is chosen. Phillips asked him: \"What's your response to the people who are saying the policy should be 'you land here, unlawfully, you get locked up and you get deported straight away. No ifs, no buts'?\" Mr Cottrell said he would tell them \"you haven't solved the problem\", adding: \"You've just put it somewhere else and you've done nothing to address the issue of what brings people to this country. \"And so if you think that's the answer, you will discover in due course that all you have done is made the problem worse. \n                  Sir Keir Starmer promises small boat migrants will be 'detained and sent back'\n                 \n                  Two charged after Epping protests, as reports say 13 councils will continue legal action to shut asylum hotels\n                 \n                  Epping migrant hotel resident told girl, 14, he wanted her to have his baby, court hears\n                 \"Don't misunderstand me, I have every sympathy with those who find this difficult, every sympathy - as I do with those living in poverty. \"But… we should actively resist the kind of isolationist, short term kneejerk 'send them home'.\"  Asked if that was his message to the Reform leader, he said: \"Well, it is. I mean, Mr Farage is saying the things he's saying, but he is not offering any long-term solution to the big issues which are convulsing our world, which lead to this. And, I see no other way.\" You can watch the full interview on Sunday Morning with Trevor Phillips on Sky News from 8.30am Read more:Masked men among those attempting to enter migrant hotelPM says small boat migrants will be 'detained and sent back'Asylum: Time for a different approach?  Mr Farage, the MP for Clacton, was asked at a news conference this week what he would say if Christian leaders opposed his plan. \"Whoever the Christian leaders are at any given point in time, I think over the last decades, quite a few of them have been rather out of touch, perhaps with their own flock,\" he said. 👉 Listen to Sky News Daily on your podcast app 👈 \"We believe that what we're offering is right and proper, and we believe for a political party that was founded around the slogan of family, community, country that we are doing right by all of those things, with these plans we put forward today,\" he added. Sky News has approached Mr Farage for comment. Presenter When Tony Blair's spin doctor Alastair Campbell told journalists that \"We don't do God\", many took it as a statement of ideology. In fact it was the caution of a canny operator who knows that the most dangerous opponent in politics is a religious leader licensed to challenge your very morality. Stephen Cottrell, the Archbishop of York, currently the effective head of the worldwide Anglican communion, could not have been clearer in his denunciation of what he calls the Reform party's \"isolationist, short term, kneejerk 'send them home'\" approach to asylum and immigration. I sense that having ruled himself out of the race for next Archbishop of Canterbury, Reverend Cottrell feels free to preach a liberal doctrine.  Unusually, in our interview he pinpoints a political leader as, in effect, failing to demonstrate Christian charity.  Nigel Farage, who describes himself as a practising Christian, won't be greeting this as the good news of the gospel. But government ministers will also be feeling nervous.  Battered for allowing record numbers of cross- Channel migrants, and facing legal battles on asylum hotels that may go all the way to the Supreme Court, Labour has tried to head off the Reform challenge with tougher language on border control.  The last thing the prime minister needs right now is to make an enemy of the Almighty - or at least of his representatives on Earth."

        "Content": " A group of masked men were among those who attempted to enter a hotel housing asylum seekers in west London. The men were among larger groups who marched on three migrant hotels in the city on Saturday afternoon. It is unclear if any of the masked men were arrested. Protests and counter-protests over asylum hotels have taken place across the country this weekend, with two men charged over a demonstration at the Bell Hotel in Epping. It comes after the government successfully overturned a temporary injunction which would have blocked asylum seekers from being housed at the hotel. Despite the Court of Appeal decision, at least 13 other councils are considering pressing ahead with legal action over the use of asylum hotels in their areas, according to The Times.  Arrests after protests in west London Five people were arrested following the demonstrations outside a Crowne Plaza, Novotel, and Holiday Inn in West Drayton. Sky News correspondent Emma Birchley, who was on the scene, said the protests were peaceful for the vast majority of people. But the Metropolitan Police said at around noon two anti-asylum groups marched to the Crowne Plaza. \"A group of masked men attempted to enter the hotel via the rear entrance, damaging the security hoarding,\" they said. \"Officers were already in attendance and extra officers were deployed to assist.\" Video credit: @qpr_Emma Police say a \"breakaway protest group\" moved towards the nearby Novotel in Cherry Lane before some of the crowd moved towards the Holiday Inn. Five arrests were made, the force said - adding that two officers suffered minor injuries. Local MP John McDonnell, responding to the incidents, said on social media: \"Far right thugs used supposed peaceful demonstration in my constituency to give cover to attempt by masked men to break into hotel housing asylum seekers, injuring police officers. \"I wish the officers a speedy recovery. This does not represent our community.\" Read more:Farage explains deportation plansAsylum: Time for a different approach?Fast-track asylum appeals explained Two charged after protest at Epping hotel Essex Police said two men were charged after violence erupted at a protest at the Bell Hotel in Epping on Friday. Jimmy Hillard, 52, of Chequers Road, Loughton, was charged with assaulting an emergency worker and Ross Ellis, 49, of Orchard Croft, Harlow, was charged with failing to provide a specimen. A third man arrested on suspicion of violent disorder remains in custody, the force said. In Scotland, angry activists who descended on a Falkirk hotel were met by hundreds of counter-protesters. Police separated both sides behind barriers. Meanwhile, Sky News has spoken to protesters who share a sense of anger about the cost of housing asylum seekers in hotels and feel they are ignored by the government. They strongly reject being identified as \"fascists\" or \"far-right thugs\"."

        "Content": "\n          News correspondent\n              @ashnahurynag\n  Nefertiti remembers the first time she was sexually assaulted. She was just 11 years old when a family member kissed her. \"That was my first kiss,\" she says. She remembers being frozen in shock. \"It took so much away from me. It was frightening. I kept asking myself, why me? \"I couldn't tell anyone because I feared no one believed me. I started to hate myself.\" A second incident came aged 13 - this time involving a family friend in a car. \"He's sitting in the car and he's going for the gear stick, but his hand is sliding up my thigh,\" she recalls. \n                  'Disturbing' rise in abusive teen relationships - the warning signs to watch out for\n                 \n                  'Restriction zones' to be introduced for domestic abusers\n                 \n                  'I earned six-figures - but was left without a penny to escape husband who was ready to kill me'\n                 Nefertiti (not her real name to protect her identity) says she was \"pushing\" and \"fighting\" during the incident but remembers thinking: \"What is it about me? Why do men think they have the right to disrespect me?\" \"They took all that innocence away from me, and it made me hate myself even further,\" she adds. What followed from these horrifying memories was a lifetime of sporadic incidents of abuse that affected her character and identity. She even contemplated ending her own life. \"I cried, I fought, I lost respect, I just didn't care,\" she says. Nefertiti felt choked into silence. As a black woman, she says she didn't feel able to speak out or confide in anyone in authority because of fears she wouldn't be believed. Victims fear 'they won't be treated fairly' Speaking out is difficult for every survivor of abuse. But the issue is more acute in certain communities, where there is a deep distrust. In England and Wales, black women are more likely to experience domestic abuse than any other ethnic group - with 33.1% affected, according to the Office for National Statistics. Research by the UK's only specialist domestic abuse charity for black women, Sistah Space, has found 97% of women did not believe they would be treated fairly by police or support services if they reported their experiences. The London-based charity surveyed more than 2,200 women who were victims of domestic violence and found 76% said they felt unable to speak up or escape. Among the reasons, they cited a fear of being judged or stereotyped as a black woman, a fear of not being believed and a fear of retaliation from the abuser. Ngozi Fulani, the charity's chief executive, says when victims have been made invisible by both abuse and systemic neglect, being truly \"seen\" can be the first step toward freedom. Spaces where black women see themselves reflected in those who support them is why a women's refuge solely for women from African and Caribbean heritage is needed, Ms Fulani says. \"This is something that if we don't have it, black women affected by domestic abuse will continue to be traumatised, affected mentally, physically, spiritually in any other way,\" she adds. 'Deep mistrust' In response to the findings, Metropolitan Police Deputy Assistant Commissioner Dr Alison Heydari - programme director of the Police Race Action Plan - said the figures were a \"stark reminder of the deep mistrust many communities have in our service\". \"We must continue to drive projects and improvements which rebuild confidence and ensure victims of domestic abuse and other crimes have faith in us to support them,\" she added. Dr Heydari said \"positive work\" was happening in police forces but \"more needs to be done\". \"We are determined to work across policing to ensure every victim of domestic abuse gets the support they need and that offenders are brought to justice,\" she added. Nefertiti found counsel and comfort in the charity and wants other survivors to remember help does exist. \"If I had this support when I was younger, things would have been different for me,\" she says. \"Coming here, we're family. That's the best way for me to describe it. \"To women out there, come and see for yourself. If you want to talk, you can talk. Even if you just want to sit in the corner, someone will sit with you, so you're not going to be alone.\" Anyone feeling emotionally distressed or suicidal can call Samaritans for help on 116 123 or email jo@samaritans.org in the UK.

        "Content": " Greta Thunberg has rejected accusations of antisemitism as she embarks on her second flotilla to Gaza. The 22-year-old and other activists are setting sail on the largest flotilla to Gaza on Sunday, despite having been detained by Israeli forces and deported when they approached on a British-flagged yacht in June. Israel later accused the group of activists of being antisemitic - an accusation Thunberg told Sky News' Europe correspondent Siobhan Robbins she rejects. \"It is not antisemitic to say that we should not be bombing people, that one should not be living in occupation, that everyone should have the right to live in freedom and dignity, no matter who you are,\" she said.  Before the dozens of boats carrying aid embarks from Spain, the activists called on governments to pressure Israel to allow their flotilla through the naval blockade. Israel imposed the blockade on Gaza after Hamas took control of the coastal enclave in 2007 and has blocked numerous attempts to reach Gaza since, including a vessel in 2010 by its special forces in which at least nine Turkish activists were killed. But Thunberg brushed concerns about the dangers of the trip aside, saying she was instead worried about the \"silence of the world\" in light of what is happening in Gaza. \"I'm terrified to see that we seem to have lost all the humanity that we have, and there seems to be no compassion left in the world amongst the vast majority of people who are able to sit on the couch and watch the genocide unfold that I am terrified for,\" she added. Israel has repeatedly denied claims of genocide and previously described the first ship, Madleen, as \"the selfie yacht\", dismissing the aid ship as a propaganda stunt in support of Hamas. In a statement to Sky News, the Israel Defence Forces (IDF) said: \"The IDF enforces the security naval blockade on the Gaza Strip and is prepared for a wide range of scenarios, which it will act upon in accordance with the directives of the political echelon.\" Thunberg said: \"It's important that by doing so, by continuing this blockade, Israel is violating international law. And what we are trying to do is to use our rights to sail on international waters and to deliver humanitarian aid, which Israel is not allowed to block from coming in.\" The naval blockade has remained in place through conflicts, including the current war, which began when Hamas fighters attacked southern Israel on 7 October 2023, killing more than 1,200 people and taking 251 hostages. Israel's retaliatory offensive against Hamas has since killed almost 63,000 Palestinians, according to the Hamas-run Gaza health ministry, while part of the Strip is suffering from famine, according to a global hunger monitor - something Israel denies. In March, Israel also sealed off Gaza by land, not letting in supplies for three months, claiming Hamas was diverting aid. Asked what would be her message to Hamas, which is still holding 48 hostages in Gaza, around 20 of whom Israel still believes to be alive, Thunberg said she does \"not stand behind killing civilians\". \"But we translate that into reality and we're seeing how many hundreds of thousands of people are dying in Gaza now, how many hundreds of thousands of people have been deprived [of] their dignity and justice and freedom by Israel,\" she added. The IDF said in its statement: \"Israel allows and facilitates the entry of humanitarian aid into the Gaza Strip. Since the beginning of the war, over two million tons of aid have been delivered to Gaza - approximately one ton of aid per person on average. \"The last few months 9,000 aid trucks have entered through land crossings, as publicly reported. \"In recent weeks, approximately 300 aid trucks have entered daily, primarily carrying food, medical supplies, hygiene products, and other essential items according to needs identified by international organisations and the UN. Israel does not impose quantitative limits on aid trucks entering Gaza. \"Several significant measures have been implemented to expand aid volume and facilitate collection by the UN and international organisations. Recent data on aid deliveries demonstrates Israel's commitment to facilitating humanitarian assistance to Gaza.\" Read more from Sky News:US blocks Palestinian president from UN meetingIsrael's Gaza City plan condemned by EU ministers Thunberg, who is among hundreds of people from 44 countries on the flotilla, hopes their mission will bring symbolic aid and help open up a humanitarian corridor to deliver more aid.

That's equates to roughly 675,000 pupils at risk. More than half of the 9,000 teachers surveyed feared up to three children per class may be affected, while 13% were concerned about four to six pupils. In some classes, teachers said up to 11 children could face food insecurity, which occurs when there is a consistent lack of access to affordable and nutritious food. \"My son goes to breakfast club every morning and he obviously gets free school meals, but with him being home in the holidays these two meals have got to be covered by me,\" Richard says. \"This obviously, with the cost of living and high food costs, means our food bills go up. Plus, I've got three children, so you're talking about a dozen extra meals a day.\" At William Ford Junior School in Dagenham, staff have been running a food bank in partnership with the Felix Project. Family support worker Kerry Noakes said: \"We were only expecting to cater for about 50 families. But we've reached far more, parents, elderly relatives, neighbours. The need is huge. \"We know Felix estimated one child in every class would go hungry. We felt it was more accurate to say four or five children in each class.\" At the Felix Project in London, demand has surged. Rachel Ledwith, the charity's head of community engagement, said: \"More and more working families are finding themselves struggling to feed their children. \"More and more of them are having to turn to food banks and numbers are increasing every year.\" Even with 5,000 cooked meals a day leaving its kitchen, the charity says the demand outstrips what it can provide. \"Even with the incredible work that we're doing... there are still children going hungry,\" Rachel says. \"Our services are oversubscribed every summer, so it's heartbreaking that we still have to say no.\" Read more:Education secretary calls on parents to tackle children's bad behaviourClear regional divide in A-level results on record-breaking dayGovt 'lacks coherent plan' to address teacher shortage The scale is staggering.

Earlier this week, it was announced government funding for a programme which offers children from low-income families free meals and activities during the school holidays will be extended. Some £600m is being invested to extend the Holiday Activities and Food (HAF) programme - which funds councils to provide holiday childcare, activities and food for children eligible for free school meals - for another three years. The HAF programme - for school-aged children from reception to year 11 - helps parents to make savings of more than £300 a year, the DfE said."

Lord Brocket, 73, who finished fourth on the 2004 series of I'm a Celebrity… Get Me Out of Here! was arrested on Friday. He appeared in the dock at Westminster Magistrates' Court on Saturday charged with two counts of rape in London on 10 August and one count of sexual assault by penetration in the village of Warbleton, East Sussex, on 5 May. Brocket, from Fulham, west London, spoke to confirm his name, date of birth and address during the short hearing, where the allegations were outlined by prosecutor Aarya Mishra.  They all relate to the same woman, who cannot be identified because she is an alleged victim of sexual offences. Brocket was not asked to enter pleas to any of the charges, which can only be tried at the crown court, but the court heard he denies the allegations. District judge Louisa Cieciora granted him bail with conditions including a GPS tag-monitored exclusion from coming within the M25. She said Brocket, who was represented by Henry Milner, must attend Isleworth Crown Court for the next hearing on 26 September. A Metropolitan Police spokesperson said: \"Brocket was arrested on Friday 29 August on suspicion of rape and charged on Saturday 30 August. \"The rape charges relate to an incident involving a woman that took place in the early hours of Saturday 10 August in Fulham.

He was killed on Thursday in a strike on the Yemeni capital Sanaa, along with a number of other ministers, the group said in a statement. The Houthis have controlled much of northwestern Yemen since 2014 after forcing out the internationally recognised government and starting a civil war. They are backed by Iran and have conducted repeated strikes on shipping in the Red Sea and Israel.   \"The criminal, treacherous Israeli enemy targeted them during a routine workshop held by the government to evaluate its activities and performance over the past year,\" Houthi president Mahdi al Mashat said in a statement reported by the Yemen News Agency. Mashat also claimed Israel should expect \"dark days\" ahead. The strike took place as a Houthi-owned TV station was broadcasting a speech from the group's secretive leader Abdul Malik al Houthi, sharing updates on the latest developments in Gaza and vowing retaliation. Rahawi was not a part of the inner circle around Houthi that runs the military and strategic affairs of the armed group. His government, like the previous one, was tasked with running the day-to-day civilian affairs in Sanaa and other Houthi-held areas. The Israel Defence Forces (IDF) said on Friday it had \"carried out a significant strike against strategic targets of the Houthi terror regime in Yemen\".

The strike came three days after the Houthis launched a ballistic missile towards Israel. Who was Rahawi? The late rebel prime minister hailed from the southern province of Abyan, and was an ally to former Yemeni president Ali Abdullah Saleh. He allied himself with the Houthis when the group took Sanaa in 2014 and was appointed prime minister in August last year. He is the most senior Houthi official to be killed since the US and Israel began their air and naval campaign in response to the group's attacks on Israel and ships in the Red Sea."

        "Content": "The education secretary has said \"we all need to do more\" to improve attendance and behaviour in schools. Bridget Phillipson said the government had already made progress with five million more days in school this year, \"but we all need to do more, and when it comes to getting kids in and behaving - this includes mums, dads and carers too\". This comes as the government rolls out measures to support schools with attendance and behaviour as part of its Plan for Change. The Department for Education (DfE) said on Sunday that an initial wave of 21 schools will serve as hubs, which will share strategies from heads who have successfully taken action on attendance and behaviour. Around 800 schools attended by around 600,000 pupils will have access to support from these hubs, and the DfE said the programme is expected to support 5,000 schools, including intensive support for 500. Ms Phillipson said there was a particular concern about white working-class children, who have among the highest overall absence rates. She wrote in The Sunday Telegraph that \"for far too many white working-class children, opportunity is out of reach\", with statistics showing that \"one in 10 white children on free school meals were suspended last year, with suspension rates five times higher than their peers\". \n                  'We've sold toys, clothes, and even used my kids' birthday money': The parents struggling to feed kids during school holidays\n                 \n                  It's GCSE results day - and some students can get theirs via an app this year\n                 \n                  A-level results show deepening inequality despite vows to tackle attainment gaps\n                 \"These children are swimming upstream against a staggering, entrenched class divide that sees them disproportionately kicked out of education or not attending in the first place,\" the education secretary said. Ms Phillipson insisted that \"it is only this government that has the courage to upend a system that has resolutely failed white working-class children\".  The DfE is expected to set out more plans to tackle behaviour in a white paper due to be published in the autumn. The latest figures by the department show that while the overall absence rate was lower in autumn 202/25 than it was the previous year, the number of severely absent students - missing 50% or more - increased from 142,000 in autumn 2023/24 to 148,000 in autumn 2024/25. The DfE said data shows seven out of every 30 classroom minutes are lost to disruption. A survey by the NASUWT teaching union earlier this year found 81% of its members felt the number of pupils exhibiting violent and abusive behaviour at school had increased.

        "Content": "At least three people have died after protesters set fire to a regional parliament building in Indonesia during a fifth day of unrest. Five people have been taken to hospital with burns or broken bones after jumping from the building in Makassar, the capital city of South Sulawesi province, after it was set alight on Friday, according to local disaster official Fadli Tahar. Rescuers retrieved the bodies of three people believed to have been trapped in the building on Saturday morning.    In West Java's Bandung city, protesters set a regional parliament ablaze on Friday, but no casualties were reported. Protesters also stormed the regional police headquarters in Surabaya, Indonesia's second-largest city, after destroying fences and torching vehicles. Indonesian security forces used tear gas and water cannons against the protesters, who hit back with fireworks and wooden clubs. The protests, which have been raging since Monday, started in Jakarta following reports that 580 lawmakers receive a monthly housing allowance of 50 million rupiah (£2,255) in addition to their salaries. The allowance, which was introduced last year, is almost 10 times the minimum wage in the capital. Critics say the new allowance is not only excessive, but also insensitive at a time when most people are struggling with soaring living costs, taxes and unemployment. The Jakarta home of politician Ahmad Sahroni, from the political party NasDem, was looted by a crowd, which took items including furniture, according to local media. Mr Sahroni has faced criticism for labelling people who called for parliament to be dissolved amid anger over lawmakers' allowances \"the stupidest people in the world\". The protests intensified and grew more violent after a 21-year-old food delivery driver was killed by an armoured police vehicle, which reportedly sped through a crowd of protesters in Jakarta and hit him on Thursday. The protests have also reached the tourist island of Bali, where hundreds of delivery drivers and students staged a solidarity protest over his death, calling for police reform and the release of those arrested during the protests. Clashes between riot police and protesters erupted in multiple cities across Indonesia on Friday, including in Medan, Solo, Yogyakarta, Magelang, Malang, Bengkulu, Pekanbaru and Manokwari in the eastern Papua region. Nearly 1,000 people were arrested in rallies in Jakarta alone by Thursday, according to the National Commission on Human Rights. Foreign embassies in Jakarta, including the US, Australia and several Southeast Asian countries, have warned their citizens to avoid protest areas or large public gatherings. Indonesian President Prabowo Subianto cancelled his planned visit to China next week due to the protests, which have escalated into riots in several regions, with several buildings and public facilities set alight.

        "Content": " The Archbishop of York has told Sky News the UK should resist Reform's \"kneejerk\" plan for the mass deportation of migrants, telling Nigel Farage he is not offering any \"long-term solution\". Stephen Cottrell said in an interview with Trevor Phillips he has \"every sympathy\" with people who are concerned about asylum seekers coming to the country illegally. But he criticised the plan announced by Reform on Tuesday to deport 600,000 people, which would be enabled by striking deals with the Taliban and Iran, saying it will not \"solve the problem\". Mr Cottrell is currently acting head of the Church of England while a new Archbishop of Canterbury is chosen. Phillips asked him: \"What's your response to the people who are saying the policy should be 'you land here, unlawfully, you get locked up and you get deported straight away. No ifs, no buts'?\" Mr Cottrell said he would tell them \"you haven't solved the problem\", adding: \"You've just put it somewhere else and you've done nothing to address the issue of what brings people to this country. \"And so if you think that's the answer, you will discover in due course that all you have done is made the problem worse. \n                  Sir Keir Starmer promises small boat migrants will be 'detained and sent back'\n                 \n                  Two charged after Epping protests, as reports say 13 councils will continue legal action to shut asylum hotels\n                 \n                  Epping migrant hotel resident told girl, 14, he wanted her to have his baby, court hears\n                 \"Don't misunderstand me, I have every sympathy with those who find this difficult, every sympathy - as I do with those living in poverty. \"But… we should actively resist the kind of isolationist, short term kneejerk 'send them home'.\"  Asked if that was his message to the Reform leader, he said: \"Well, it is. I mean, Mr Farage is saying the things he's saying, but he is not offering any long-term solution to the big issues which are convulsing our world, which lead to this. And, I see no other way.\" You can watch the full interview on Sunday Morning with Trevor Phillips on Sky News from 8.30am Read more:Masked men among those attempting to enter migrant hotelPM says small boat migrants will be 'detained and sent back'Asylum: Time for a different approach?  Mr Farage, the MP for Clacton, was asked at a news conference this week what he would say if Christian leaders opposed his plan. \"Whoever the Christian leaders are at any given point in time, I think over the last decades, quite a few of them have been rather out of touch, perhaps with their own flock,\" he said. 👉 Listen to Sky News Daily on your podcast app 👈 \"We believe that what we're offering is right and proper, and we believe for a political party that was founded around the slogan of family, community, country that we are doing right by all of those things, with these plans we put forward today,\" he added. Sky News has approached Mr Farage for comment. Presenter When Tony Blair's spin doctor Alastair Campbell told journalists that \"We don't do God\", many took it as a statement of ideology. In fact it was the caution of a canny operator who knows that the most dangerous opponent in politics is a religious leader licensed to challenge your very morality. Stephen Cottrell, the Archbishop of York, currently the effective head of the worldwide Anglican communion, could not have been clearer in his denunciation of what he calls the Reform party's \"isolationist, short term, kneejerk 'send them home'\" approach to asylum and immigration. I sense that having ruled himself out of the race for next Archbishop of Canterbury, Reverend Cottrell feels free to preach a liberal doctrine.  Unusually, in our interview he pinpoints a political leader as, in effect, failing to demonstrate Christian charity.  Nigel Farage, who describes himself as a practising Christian, won't be greeting this as the good news of the gospel. But government ministers will also be feeling nervous.  Battered for allowing record numbers of cross- Channel migrants, and facing legal battles on asylum hotels that may go all the way to the Supreme Court, Labour has tried to head off the Reform challenge with tougher language on border control.  The last thing the prime minister needs right now is to make an enemy of the Almighty - or at least of his representatives on Earth."

The men were among larger groups who marched on three migrant hotels in the city on Saturday afternoon. It is unclear if any of the masked men were arrested. Protests and counter-protests over asylum hotels have taken place across the country this weekend, with two men charged over a demonstration at the Bell Hotel in Epping. It comes after the government successfully overturned a temporary injunction which would have blocked asylum seekers from being housed at the hotel. Despite the Court of Appeal decision, at least 13 other councils are considering pressing ahead with legal action over the use of asylum hotels in their areas, according to The Times.  Arrests after protests in west London Five people were arrested following the demonstrations outside a Crowne Plaza, Novotel, and Holiday Inn in West Drayton. Sky News correspondent Emma Birchley, who was on the scene, said the protests were peaceful for the vast majority of people. But the Metropolitan Police said at around noon two anti-asylum groups marched to the Crowne Plaza. \"A group of masked men attempted to enter the hotel via the rear entrance, damaging the security hoarding,\" they said. \"Officers were already in attendance and extra officers were deployed to assist.\" Video credit: @qpr_Emma Police say a \"breakaway protest group\" moved towards the nearby Novotel in Cherry Lane before some of the crowd moved towards the Holiday Inn. Five arrests were made, the force said - adding that two officers suffered minor injuries. Local MP John McDonnell, responding to the incidents, said on social media: \"Far right thugs used supposed peaceful demonstration in my constituency to give cover to attempt by masked men to break into hotel housing asylum seekers, injuring police officers. \"I wish the officers a speedy recovery.

A third man arrested on suspicion of violent disorder remains in custody, the force said. In Scotland, angry activists who descended on a Falkirk hotel were met by hundreds of counter-protesters. Police separated both sides behind barriers. Meanwhile, Sky News has spoken to protesters who share a sense of anger about the cost of housing asylum seekers in hotels and feel they are ignored by the government.

That's equates to roughly 675,000 pupils at risk. More than half of the 9,000 teachers surveyed feared up to three children per class may be affected, while 13% were concerned about four to six pupils. In some classes, teachers said up to 11 children could face food insecurity, which occurs when there is a consistent lack of access to affordable and nutritious food. \"My son goes to breakfast club every morning and he obviously gets free school meals, but with him being home in the holidays these two meals have got to be covered by me,\" Richard says. \"This obviously, with the cost of living and high food costs, means our food bills go up. Plus, I've got three children, so you're talking about a dozen extra meals a day.\" At William Ford Junior School in Dagenham, staff have been running a food bank in partnership with the Felix Project. Family support worker Kerry Noakes said: \"We were only expecting to cater for about 50 families. But we've reached far more, parents, elderly relatives, neighbours. The need is huge. \"We know Felix estimated one child in every class would go hungry. We felt it was more accurate to say four or five children in each class.\" At the Felix Project in London, demand has surged. Rachel Ledwith, the charity's head of community engagement, said: \"More and more working families are finding themselves struggling to feed their children. \"More and more of them are having to turn to food banks and numbers are increasing every year.\" Even with 5,000 cooked meals a day leaving its kitchen, the charity says the demand outstrips what it can provide. \"Even with the incredible work that we're doing... there are still children going hungry,\" Rachel says. \"Our services are oversubscribed every summer, so it's heartbreaking that we still have to say no.\" Read more:Education secretary calls on parents to tackle children's bad behaviourClear regional divide in A-level results on record-breaking dayGovt 'lacks coherent plan' to address teacher shortage The scale is staggering.

Earlier this week, it was announced government funding for a programme which offers children from low-income families free meals and activities during the school holidays will be extended. Some £600m is being invested to extend the Holiday Activities and Food (HAF) programme - which funds councils to provide holiday childcare, activities and food for children eligible for free school meals - for another three years. The HAF programme - for school-aged children from reception to year 11 - helps parents to make savings of more than £300 a year, the DfE said."

Lord Brocket, 73, who finished fourth on the 2004 series of I'm a Celebrity… Get Me Out of Here! was arrested on Friday. He appeared in the dock at Westminster Magistrates' Court on Saturday charged with two counts of rape in London on 10 August and one count of sexual assault by penetration in the village of Warbleton, East Sussex, on 5 May. Brocket, from Fulham, west London, spoke to confirm his name, date of birth and address during the short hearing, where the allegations were outlined by prosecutor Aarya Mishra.  They all relate to the same woman, who cannot be identified because she is an alleged victim of sexual offences. Brocket was not asked to enter pleas to any of the charges, which can only be tried at the crown court, but the court heard he denies the allegations. District judge Louisa Cieciora granted him bail with conditions including a GPS tag-monitored exclusion from coming within the M25. She said Brocket, who was represented by Henry Milner, must attend Isleworth Crown Court for the next hearing on 26 September. A Metropolitan Police spokesperson said: \"Brocket was arrested on Friday 29 August on suspicion of rape and charged on Saturday 30 August. \"The rape charges relate to an incident involving a woman that took place in the early hours of Saturday 10 August in Fulham. The matter was reported to police the same day. \"The sexual assault by penetration charge relates to an incident on Monday 5 May in Warbleton, East Sussex. \"The victim is being supported by specialist officers.\""

I started to hate myself.\" A second incident came aged 13 - this time involving a family friend in a car. \"He's sitting in the car and he's going for the gear stick, but his hand is sliding up my thigh,\" she recalls. \n                  'Disturbing' rise in abusive teen relationships - the warning signs to watch out for\n                 \n                  'Restriction zones' to be introduced for domestic abusers\n                 \n                  'I earned six-figures - but was left without a penny to escape husband who was ready to kill me'\n                 Nefertiti (not her real name to protect her identity) says she was \"pushing\" and \"fighting\" during the incident but remembers thinking: \"What is it about me? Why do men think they have the right to disrespect me?\" \"They took all that innocence away from me, and it made me hate myself even further,\" she adds. What followed from these horrifying memories was a lifetime of sporadic incidents of abuse that affected her character and identity. She even contemplated ending her own life. \"I cried, I fought, I lost respect, I just didn't care,\" she says. Nefertiti felt choked into silence. As a black woman, she says she didn't feel able to speak out or confide in anyone in authority because of fears she wouldn't be believed. Victims fear 'they won't be treated fairly' Speaking out is difficult for every survivor of abuse. But the issue is more acute in certain communities, where there is a deep distrust. In England and Wales, black women are more likely to experience domestic abuse than any other ethnic group - with 33.1% affected, according to the Office for National Statistics. Research by the UK's only specialist domestic abuse charity for black women, Sistah Space, has found 97% of women did not believe they would be treated fairly by police or support services if they reported their experiences. The London-based charity surveyed more than 2,200 women who were victims of domestic violence and found 76% said they felt unable to speak up or escape. Among the reasons, they cited a fear of being judged or stereotyped as a black woman, a fear of not being believed and a fear of retaliation from the abuser. Ngozi Fulani, the charity's chief executive, says when victims have been made invisible by both abuse and systemic neglect, being truly \"seen\" can be the first step toward freedom. Spaces where black women see themselves reflected in those who support them is why a women's refuge solely for women from African and Caribbean heritage is needed, Ms Fulani says. \"This is something that if we don't have it, black women affected by domestic abuse will continue to be traumatised, affected mentally, physically, spiritually in any other way,\" she adds. 'Deep mistrust' In response to the findings, Metropolitan Police Deputy Assistant Commissioner Dr Alison Heydari - programme director of the Police Race Action Plan - said the figures were a \"stark reminder of the deep mistrust many communities have in our service\". \"We must continue to drive projects and improvements which rebuild confidence and ensure victims of domestic abuse and other crimes have faith in us to support them,\" she added. Dr Heydari said \"positive work\" was happening in police forces but \"more needs to be done\". \"We are determined to work across policing to ensure every victim of domestic abuse gets the support they need and that offenders are brought to justice,\" she added. Nefertiti found counsel and comfort in the charity and wants other survivors to remember help does exist. \"If I had this support when I was younger, things would have been different for me,\" she says. \"Coming here, we're family. That's the best way for me to describe it. \"To women out there, come and see for yourself. If you want to talk, you can talk. Even if you just want to sit in the corner, someone will sit with you, so you're not going to be alone.\" Anyone feeling emotionally distressed or suicidal can call Samaritans for help on 116 123 or email jo@samaritans.org in the UK.

        "Content": "Sir Keir Starmer has promised that migrants arriving in the UK on small boats will be \"detained and sent back\" as the number crossing the English Channel remains at a record high. The prime minister is facing mounting pressure to show results on tackling Channel crossings and ending the use of asylum hotels, with small-scale protests outside the hotels continuing. Sir Keir said on X: \"I am clear: we will not reward illegal entry. If you cross the Channel unlawfully, you will be detained and sent back.\" The UK and France are trialling a scheme to send migrants arriving on small boats back to France in exchange for an asylum seeker being brought to the UK on a legal route.  But the numbers involved in this scheme are likely to represent only a small fraction of those who arrive. So far in 2025, 29,003 migrants crossed the Channel in small boats, a record number for this point in a year. Sir Keir's promise comes as the government won a Court of Appeal challenge against a temporary injunction, allowing migrants to continue being housed at the Bell Hotel in Epping.  Ministers are bracing for further legal challenges and ongoing protests over the use of hotels around the country. Labour's former lord chancellor, Lord Falconer, said while the government was right to take the Epping case to the Court of Appeal, Labour have \"obviously got to move forward in relation to closing the hotels and also stopping the crossings\". Labour had promised to close asylum hotels by the time of the next general election. \"The country wants some action in relation to it,\" Lord Falconer told BBC Radio 4's Today show. Lord Falconer, who served under former prime minister Sir Tony Blair, warned his party that if the government could not show results on tackling Channel crossings, support for Reform would continue to grow, \"because they don't have the burden of having to be practical\". Nigel Farage's party has consistently led in opinion polls since the spring, and the latest BMG poll for The i Paper puts them at 35%, 15 points ahead of Labour.

Epping Forest District Council is set to decide on Monday whether it will take its legal challenge regarding the Bell Hotel housing migrants to the Supreme Court, council leader Chris Whitbread said on Friday."

        "Content": "The education secretary has said \"we all need to do more\" to improve attendance and behaviour in schools. Bridget Phillipson said the government had already made progress with five million more days in school this year, \"but we all need to do more, and when it comes to getting kids in and behaving - this includes mums, dads and carers too\". This comes as the government rolls out measures to support schools with attendance and behaviour as part of its Plan for Change. The Department for Education (DfE) said on Sunday that an initial wave of 21 schools will serve as hubs, which will share strategies from heads who have successfully taken action on attendance and behaviour. Around 800 schools attended by around 600,000 pupils will have access to support from these hubs, and the DfE said the programme is expected to support 5,000 schools, including intensive support for 500. Ms Phillipson said there was a particular concern about white working-class children, who have among the highest overall absence rates. She wrote in The Sunday Telegraph that \"for far too many white working-class children, opportunity is out of reach\", with statistics showing that \"one in 10 white children on free school meals were suspended last year, with suspension rates five times higher than their peers\". \n                  'We've sold toys, clothes, and even used my kids' birthday money': The parents struggling to feed kids during school holidays\n                 \n                  It's GCSE results day - and some students can get theirs via an app this year\n                 \n                  A-level results show deepening inequality despite vows to tackle attainment gaps\n                 \"These children are swimming upstream against a staggering, entrenched class divide that sees them disproportionately kicked out of education or not attending in the first place,\" the education secretary said. Ms Phillipson insisted that \"it is only this government that has the courage to upend a system that has resolutely failed white working-class children\".  The DfE is expected to set out more plans to tackle behaviour in a white paper due to be published in the autumn. The latest figures by the department show that while the overall absence rate was lower in autumn 202/25 than it was the previous year, the number of severely absent students - missing 50% or more - increased from 142,000 in autumn 2023/24 to 148,000 in autumn 2024/25. The DfE said data shows seven out of every 30 classroom minutes are lost to disruption. A survey by the NASUWT teaching union earlier this year found 81% of its members felt the number of pupils exhibiting violent and abusive behaviour at school had increased.

Ewan, Jamie, and Lachlan Maclean, from Edinburgh, completed the more than 9,000-mile voyage from Peru to Australia after 139 days, five hours and 52 minutes at sea. They were greeted by more than 50 friends and family members, including their mother Sheila, and fans as they arrived in Cairns on Saturday, nearly five months after setting off from Lima on 12 April. Jamie, 31, said: \"This won't surprise anybody - but all I want is a pizza. \"Things got tough towards the end and we seriously thought we might run out of food. Despite how exhausted we were, we had to step up a gear and make it before supplies ran out, but now we get to eat proper food. \"Ocean rowing has given us newfound appreciation for things we used to take for granted - like going for a shower, lying in bed, or simply leaning on something stationary. \"It was the most incredible, relentless and often surreal experience of my life. \"While I might miss the routine, the solitude, the sunsets, and sunrises and so much more, right now I'm just very glad to be back on land with my friends and family who I've missed so much. The whole thing will take a while to sink in.\" The brothers spent up to 14 hours a day rowing as they crossed the world's largest ocean on their custom-built carbon fibre boat, battling injuries, extreme weather conditions and a quicky depleting supply of food. Ewan, 33, and Jamie suffered crippling seasickness for the first two weeks of the journey.

        "Content": "\n          Foreign news reporter\n              @MikeRDrummond\n  More than 63,000 Palestinians have now reportedly been killed during Israel's war in Gaza, a figure likely to rise after the IDF declared Gaza City a combat zone on Friday. The number of people killed, reported by the Hamas-run Gaza health ministry, follows nearly 23 months of war. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has been pushing ahead with his plan to militarily occupy the Gaza Strip, starting with Gaza City, with the goal of destroying Hamas and returning the remaining Israeli hostages.   Israel on Friday claimed the city was a Hamas stronghold and alleged that a network of tunnels remains in use despite several previous large-scale raids on the area. Israeli army spokesperson Avichay Adraee urged Palestinians to flee south, calling evacuation of the city \"inevitable\". But the head of the Red Cross warned it would be impossible to keep people safe during such a mass evacuation. Many people in Gaza City would not be able to follow evacuation orders because they are starving, sick or injured, Mirjana Spoljaric said. International humanitarian law requires Israel to ensure civilians have access to shelter, safety and nutrition,when evacuation orders are issued. \"These conditions cannot currently be met in Gaza. This makes any evacuation not only unfeasible but incomprehensible under the present circumstances,\" Ms Spoljaric added. Meanwhile, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) announced it had targeted Abu Obeida, a spokesperson for Hamas's armed wing, in a strike on Gaza City, according to Israeli media. And Mr Netanyahu later said the body of hostage Idan Shtivi was retrieved from Gaza.

Israel has previously blamed Hamas militants for fomenting chaos and endangering civilians at aid sites. The conflict began with a Hamas-led attack on Israel on 7 October 2023, which saw around 1,200 people killed and about 250 people taken hostage."

Five people have been taken to hospital with burns or broken bones after jumping from the building in Makassar, the capital city of South Sulawesi province, after it was set alight on Friday, according to local disaster official Fadli Tahar. Rescuers retrieved the bodies of three people believed to have been trapped in the building on Saturday morning.    In West Java's Bandung city, protesters set a regional parliament ablaze on Friday, but no casualties were reported. Protesters also stormed the regional police headquarters in Surabaya, Indonesia's second-largest city, after destroying fences and torching vehicles. Indonesian security forces used tear gas and water cannons against the protesters, who hit back with fireworks and wooden clubs. The protests, which have been raging since Monday, started in Jakarta following reports that 580 lawmakers receive a monthly housing allowance of 50 million rupiah (£2,255) in addition to their salaries. The allowance, which was introduced last year, is almost 10 times the minimum wage in the capital. Critics say the new allowance is not only excessive, but also insensitive at a time when most people are struggling with soaring living costs, taxes and unemployment. The Jakarta home of politician Ahmad Sahroni, from the political party NasDem, was looted by a crowd, which took items including furniture, according to local media. Mr Sahroni has faced criticism for labelling people who called for parliament to be dissolved amid anger over lawmakers' allowances \"the stupidest people in the world\". The protests intensified and grew more violent after a 21-year-old food delivery driver was killed by an armoured police vehicle, which reportedly sped through a crowd of protesters in Jakarta and hit him on Thursday. The protests have also reached the tourist island of Bali, where hundreds of delivery drivers and students staged a solidarity protest over his death, calling for police reform and the release of those arrested during the protests. Clashes between riot police and protesters erupted in multiple cities across Indonesia on Friday, including in Medan, Solo, Yogyakarta, Magelang, Malang, Bengkulu, Pekanbaru and Manokwari in the eastern Papua region. Nearly 1,000 people were arrested in rallies in Jakarta alone by Thursday, according to the National Commission on Human Rights. Foreign embassies in Jakarta, including the US, Australia and several Southeast Asian countries, have warned their citizens to avoid protest areas or large public gatherings. Indonesian President Prabowo Subianto cancelled his planned visit to China next week due to the protests, which have escalated into riots in several regions, with several buildings and public facilities set alight.

        "Content": " Greta Thunberg has rejected accusations of antisemitism as she embarks on her second flotilla to Gaza. The 22-year-old and other activists are setting sail on the largest flotilla to Gaza on Sunday, despite having been detained by Israeli forces and deported when they approached on a British-flagged yacht in June. Israel later accused the group of activists of being antisemitic - an accusation Thunberg told Sky News' Europe correspondent Siobhan Robbins she rejects. \"It is not antisemitic to say that we should not be bombing people, that one should not be living in occupation, that everyone should have the right to live in freedom and dignity, no matter who you are,\" she said.  Before the dozens of boats carrying aid embarks from Spain, the activists called on governments to pressure Israel to allow their flotilla through the naval blockade. Israel imposed the blockade on Gaza after Hamas took control of the coastal enclave in 2007 and has blocked numerous attempts to reach Gaza since, including a vessel in 2010 by its special forces in which at least nine Turkish activists were killed. But Thunberg brushed concerns about the dangers of the trip aside, saying she was instead worried about the \"silence of the world\" in light of what is happening in Gaza. \"I'm terrified to see that we seem to have lost all the humanity that we have, and there seems to be no compassion left in the world amongst the vast majority of people who are able to sit on the couch and watch the genocide unfold that I am terrified for,\" she added. Israel has repeatedly denied claims of genocide and previously described the first ship, Madleen, as \"the selfie yacht\", dismissing the aid ship as a propaganda stunt in support of Hamas. In a statement to Sky News, the Israel Defence Forces (IDF) said: \"The IDF enforces the security naval blockade on the Gaza Strip and is prepared for a wide range of scenarios, which it will act upon in accordance with the directives of the political echelon.\" Thunberg said: \"It's important that by doing so, by continuing this blockade, Israel is violating international law. And what we are trying to do is to use our rights to sail on international waters and to deliver humanitarian aid, which Israel is not allowed to block from coming in.\" The naval blockade has remained in place through conflicts, including the current war, which began when Hamas fighters attacked southern Israel on 7 October 2023, killing more than 1,200 people and taking 251 hostages. Israel's retaliatory offensive against Hamas has since killed almost 63,000 Palestinians, according to the Hamas-run Gaza health ministry, while part of the Strip is suffering from famine, according to a global hunger monitor - something Israel denies. In March, Israel also sealed off Gaza by land, not letting in supplies for three months, claiming Hamas was diverting aid. Asked what would be her message to Hamas, which is still holding 48 hostages in Gaza, around 20 of whom Israel still believes to be alive, Thunberg said she does \"not stand behind killing civilians\". \"But we translate that into reality and we're seeing how many hundreds of thousands of people are dying in Gaza now, how many hundreds of thousands of people have been deprived [of] their dignity and justice and freedom by Israel,\" she added. The IDF said in its statement: \"Israel allows and facilitates the entry of humanitarian aid into the Gaza Strip. Since the beginning of the war, over two million tons of aid have been delivered to Gaza - approximately one ton of aid per person on average. \"The last few months 9,000 aid trucks have entered through land crossings, as publicly reported. \"In recent weeks, approximately 300 aid trucks have entered daily, primarily carrying food, medical supplies, hygiene products, and other essential items according to needs identified by international organisations and the UN. Israel does not impose quantitative limits on aid trucks entering Gaza. \"Several significant measures have been implemented to expand aid volume and facilitate collection by the UN and international organisations. Recent data on aid deliveries demonstrates Israel's commitment to facilitating humanitarian assistance to Gaza.\" Read more from Sky News:US blocks Palestinian president from UN meetingIsrael's Gaza City plan condemned by EU ministers Thunberg, who is among hundreds of people from 44 countries on the flotilla, hopes their mission will bring symbolic aid and help open up a humanitarian corridor to deliver more aid.

        "Content": "Israel has killed the Houthi rebel prime minister Ahmed al Rahawi, the Iranian-backed militant group has said. He was killed on Thursday in a strike on the Yemeni capital Sanaa, along with a number of other ministers, the group said in a statement. The Houthis have controlled much of northwestern Yemen since 2014 after forcing out the internationally recognised government and starting a civil war. They are backed by Iran and have conducted repeated strikes on shipping in the Red Sea and Israel.   \"The criminal, treacherous Israeli enemy targeted them during a routine workshop held by the government to evaluate its activities and performance over the past year,\" Houthi president Mahdi al Mashat said in a statement reported by the Yemen News Agency. Mashat also claimed Israel should expect \"dark days\" ahead. The strike took place as a Houthi-owned TV station was broadcasting a speech from the group's secretive leader Abdul Malik al Houthi, sharing updates on the latest developments in Gaza and vowing retaliation. Rahawi was not a part of the inner circle around Houthi that runs the military and strategic affairs of the armed group. His government, like the previous one, was tasked with running the day-to-day civilian affairs in Sanaa and other Houthi-held areas. The Israel Defence Forces (IDF) said on Friday it had \"carried out a significant strike against strategic targets of the Houthi terror regime in Yemen\".

The strike came three days after the Houthis launched a ballistic missile towards Israel. Who was Rahawi? The late rebel prime minister hailed from the southern province of Abyan, and was an ally to former Yemeni president Ali Abdullah Saleh. He allied himself with the Houthis when the group took Sanaa in 2014 and was appointed prime minister in August last year. He is the most senior Houthi official to be killed since the US and Israel began their air and naval campaign in response to the group's attacks on Israel and ships in the Red Sea."

Authorities said the gunman fired several shots at Andriy Parubiy, 54, killing him on the spot in the western city. A manhunt has been launched for the attacker, who fled the scene, but police have released no information on the killer's identity or motives. Follow live Ukraine war updates: US giving Ukraine 'deeper strike capabilities'   Mr Parubiy, a pro-Western politician, was one of the leaders of the protests in 2013-14 which called for closer ties with the EU and brought down the pro-Russian former president Viktor Yanukovych. He was also secretary of Ukraine's National Security and Defence Council from February to August 2014, a period when fighting began in eastern Ukraine and Russia annexed the Crimea peninsula. \n                  Vladimir Putin may be playing for time while he carries on beating down Ukraine's will to win\n                 \n                  UK summons Russian ambassador after British Council building hit in Kyiv\n                 \n                  Russia is mastering a new type of drone that cannot be jammed - and the West has work to do\n                 Officials gave no immediate indication whether the murder had any direct link to Russia's war in Ukraine.

        "Content": "By Rob Harris, sports correspondent, and Jacquie Beltrao, sports presenter   Far from home - at the St George's Park home of the Lionesses - female footballers from Afghanistan have been reunited. Finally, they are playing together again. Here on a mission to win places on the Afghan refugee team, uniquely established by FIFA. \"It was like a warm hug for every single one of us,\" defender Najma Arefi told Sky News. \"Being here together and working as a team. \"And we want to share with the world that we are still here and are still fighting.\" 'A dog on the street has more rights' But away from the pitch, they reflect why they are here, of everything lost when the Taliban rapidly regained power in August 2021. \"Everything collapsed overnight, and it was like a nightmare,\" Arefi said. \"Some of my friends back home, they're saying a dog on the street has more rights than a woman.\" \n                  Thousands more Afghans affected by second data breach, ministers say\n                 \n                  Victims of Afghan data leak receive scam emails offering tens of thousands in compensation, Sky News can reveal\n                 \n                  Sir Lindsay Hoyle should have made ministers tell MPs about Afghan data leak, says Harriet Harman\n                 Like Arefi, goalkeeper Elaha Safdari ended up in Doncaster after fleeing as a 17-year-old without her family. The only memento from home - her goalkeeper of the year trophy from the Afghan championship. But discrimination was felt where she once found so much joy - football - as she searched for a club in England. \"I felt racism, they attacked me,\" she said. \"I'm a refugee, I accept that, but I'm here. \"I had to start from zero and I'm just a human who had to leave a country just to stay alive.\" But Safdari never gave up on football. It inspired her through education here. Just as campaigners never gave up on Afghanistan once again having a women's football team. The first official match was in 2010, with sport symbolising the empowerment of women in a new Afghanistan. Youth teams were still playing in 2021 until the Islamic fundamentalists seized control after Afghanistan was abandoned by the Western nations that originally toppled the oppressive regime in 2001. The following day, former captain Khalida Popal told me of distressing calls she was receiving from players fearing for their safety. Evacuations were the priority. Then came the dream of seeing a national team in exile restored. It has been challenging and slow amid the wider erosion of women's rights. 'We just want FIFA to recognise us' But players credit Popal with keeping the pressure on world football's governing body, which has taken the unprecedented decision to organise matches for a refugee team in exile later this year. \"It's a great step from FIFA,\" Safdari said. \"We just want to ask FIFA to recognise us.\" They want to continue playing beyond the friendlies. Not under the refugee team banner but as the official women's national team again. And not playing under the Taliban flag. \"We've missed so many years,\" Safdari said. \"I don't even want to miss another second. I'm just ready, I'm eager and I'm hungry to play.\" Football - like international cricket - has allowed Afghanistan to only field a men's team. \"It's just so ridiculous when men are playing... representing the country,\" Safdari said. \"But women cannot\". FIFA is hoping to exert pressure diplomatically on the Taliban to restore women's rights, but no progress seems to have been made in four years. And that brings us to this training camp in Staffordshire, with FIFA bringing in Scottish manager Pauline Hamill to find 23 players to form a squad. It follows a previous talent identification camp in Australia. 'I could feel her pain' It's no regular squad selection for Scotland's most-capped player, who has since coached Scottish and Saudi youth teams. \"You're very sensitive to some of the situations that the players have been through,\" Hamill said. \"One of the players opened up to me in one of the camps and... I just could feel her pain. \"I think as a coach, people see you on the pitch and you're working technically and tactically with the players. \"But having these moments off the pitch, it's sometimes nothing can prepare you for.\" Read more from Sky News:Lionesses celebrate Euros winWomen's World Cup to be expandedAfghan women target cricket body And for the players, this is about a bigger mission, beyond football, never forgetting the sisters back home with little freedom. \"I'm still thinking that it's just a dream to be here,\" Arefi said. \"We are going to wake up and Afghanistan is free. But it is something that we need to accept... and to speak for so many women and girls that have been silenced in the country and to be their voice and to represent the world. \"Don't forget Afghan women that are there, going through hard times.\""

        "Content": " Three brothers have set a new world for rowing across the Pacific Ocean unsupported in the fastest ever time.  Ewan, Jamie, and Lachlan Maclean, from Edinburgh, completed the more than 9,000-mile voyage from Peru to Australia after 139 days, five hours and 52 minutes at sea. They were greeted by more than 50 friends and family members, including their mother Sheila, and fans as they arrived in Cairns on Saturday, nearly five months after setting off from Lima on 12 April. Jamie, 31, said: \"This won't surprise anybody - but all I want is a pizza. \"Things got tough towards the end and we seriously thought we might run out of food. Despite how exhausted we were, we had to step up a gear and make it before supplies ran out, but now we get to eat proper food. \"Ocean rowing has given us newfound appreciation for things we used to take for granted - like going for a shower, lying in bed, or simply leaning on something stationary. \"It was the most incredible, relentless and often surreal experience of my life. \"While I might miss the routine, the solitude, the sunsets, and sunrises and so much more, right now I'm just very glad to be back on land with my friends and family who I've missed so much. The whole thing will take a while to sink in.\" The brothers spent up to 14 hours a day rowing as they crossed the world's largest ocean on their custom-built carbon fibre boat, battling injuries, extreme weather conditions and a quicky depleting supply of food. Ewan, 33, and Jamie suffered crippling seasickness for the first two weeks of the journey. Youngest brother Lachlan, who turned 27 while at sea, was thrown overboard during a nightshift before being pulled back on the boat by Ewan.

Ewan, who left his job as an engineer at Dyson to take part in the adventure, said: \"This has been the hardest thing I've ever done, and I couldn't have even contemplated it without my brothers.\" The previous fastest time to cross the full Pacific Ocean was set by Russian Fedor Konyukhov, who rowed from Chile to Australia in 2014. The Macleans have already conquered the Atlantic, setting three world records in the process. After completing the 3,000-mile trip in just 35 days, they became the first three brothers to row any ocean together, the youngest trio and the fastest trio to row the journey from the Canary Islands to Antigua. Their Pacific row has raised more than £800,000 for clean water projects in Madagascar through their Maclean Foundation, launched with their father, Charles Maclean, following their 2020 record journey. But Lachlan added: \"We've completed the row but the journey isn't over. We have a charity target of £1 million.\" Actors Ewan MacGregor and Mark Wahlberg, and Red Hot Chili Peppers bassist Flea are among those to have backed the campaign."

        "Content": "\n          City editor\n              @MarkKleinmanSky\n Naguib Kheraj, the City veteran, has been shortlisted to become the next chairman of HSBC Holdings, Europe's biggest bank. Sky News can reveal that Mr Kheraj, a former Barclays finance chief, is among a small number of contenders currently being considered to replace Sir Mark Tucker. HSBC, which has a market capitalisation of £165.4bn, has been conducting a search for Sir Mark's successor since the start of the year. Money latest: How Gen Z investors are making their way in property In June, Sky News revealed that the former McKinsey boss Kevin Sneader was among the candidates being considered to lead the bank, although it was unclear this weekend whether he remained in the process. Mr Kheraj would, in many respects, be seen as a solid choice for the job. He is familiar with HSBC's core markets in Asia, having spent several years on the board of Standard Chartered, the FTSE-100 bank, latterly as deputy chairman. He also possesses extensive experience as a chairman, having led the privately held pensions insurer Rothesay Life, while he now chairs Petershill Partners, the London-listed private equity investment group backed by Goldman Sachs. Mr Kheraj's other interests have included acting as an adviser to the Aga Khan Development Board and The Wellcome Trust, as well as the Financial Services Authority. He spent 12 years at Barclays, holding board roles for much of that time, before he went on to become chief executive of JP Morgan Cazenove, the London-based investment bank. HSBC's shares have soared over the last year, rising by close to 50%, despite the headwinds posed by President Donald Trump's sweeping global tariffs regime. In June, the bank said that Sir Mark would be replaced on an interim basis by Brendan Nelson, one of its existing board members, while it continued the search for a permanent successor. Ann Godbehere, HSBC's senior independent director, said at the time: \"The nomination and corporate governance committee continues to make progress on the succession process for the next HSBC group chair. \"Our focus is on securing the best candidate to lead the board and wider group over the next phase of our growth and development.\" Sky News revealed late last year that MWM, the headhunter founded by Anna Mann, a prominent figure in the executive search sector, was advising HSBC on the process. Since then, at least one other firm has been drafted in to work on the mandate. Read more from Sky NewsExplainer: How the US war is targeting youControversial ferry boss to quitMore than 500 jobs cut at carmaker Sir Mark, who has chaired HSBC since 2017, steps down at the end of next month to become non-executive chair of AIA, the Asian insurer he used to run. He will continue to advise HSBC's board during the hunt for his long-term successor. As a financial behemoth with deep ties to both China and the US, HSBC is deeply exposed to escalating trade and diplomatic tensions between the two countries. When he was appointed, Mr Tucker became the first outsider to take the post in the bank's 152-year history - which has a big presence on the high street thanks to its acquisition of the Midland Bank in 1992. He oversaw a rapid change of leadership, appointing bank veteran John Flint to replace Stuart Gulliver as chief executive. The transition did not work out, however, with Mr Tucker deciding to sack Mr Flint after just 18 months. He was replaced on an interim basis by Noel Quinn in the summer of 2018, with that change becoming permanent in April 2020. Mr Quinn spent a further four years in the post before deciding to step down, and in July 2024 he was succeeded by Georges Elhedery, a long-serving executive in HSBC's markets unit, and more recently the bank's chief financial officer. The new chief's first big move in the top job was to unveil a sweeping reorganisation of HSBC that sees it reshaped into eastern markets and western markets businesses. He also decided to merge its commercial and investment banking operations into a single division. The restructuring, which Mr Elhedery said would \"result in a simpler, more dynamic, and agile organisation\" has drawn a mixed reaction from analysts, although it has not interrupted a strong run for the stock. During Sir Mark's tenure, HSBC has also continued to exit non-core markets, selling operations in countries such as Canada and France as it has sharpened its focus on its Asian businesses. On Friday, HSBC's London-listed shares closed at 946.7p. HSBC has been contacted for comment."

Stephen Cottrell said in an interview with Trevor Phillips he has \"every sympathy\" with people who are concerned about asylum seekers coming to the country illegally.

Sky News has approached Mr Farage for comment. Presenter When Tony Blair's spin doctor Alastair Campbell told journalists that \"We don't do God\", many took it as a statement of ideology. In fact it was the caution of a canny operator who knows that the most dangerous opponent in politics is a religious leader licensed to challenge your very morality. Stephen Cottrell, the Archbishop of York, currently the effective head of the worldwide Anglican communion, could not have been clearer in his denunciation of what he calls the Reform party's \"isolationist, short term, kneejerk 'send them home'\" approach to asylum and immigration. I sense that having ruled himself out of the race for next Archbishop of Canterbury, Reverend Cottrell feels free to preach a liberal doctrine.  Unusually, in our interview he pinpoints a political leader as, in effect, failing to demonstrate Christian charity.  Nigel Farage, who describes himself as a practising Christian, won't be greeting this as the good news of the gospel. But government ministers will also be feeling nervous.  Battered for allowing record numbers of cross- Channel migrants, and facing legal battles on asylum hotels that may go all the way to the Supreme Court, Labour has tried to head off the Reform challenge with tougher language on border control.  The last thing the prime minister needs right now is to make an enemy of the Almighty - or at least of his representatives on Earth."

        "Content": "The education secretary has said \"we all need to do more\" to improve attendance and behaviour in schools. Bridget Phillipson said the government had already made progress with five million more days in school this year, \"but we all need to do more, and when it comes to getting kids in and behaving - this includes mums, dads and carers too\". This comes as the government rolls out measures to support schools with attendance and behaviour as part of its Plan for Change. The Department for Education (DfE) said on Sunday that an initial wave of 21 schools will serve as hubs, which will share strategies from heads who have successfully taken action on attendance and behaviour. Around 800 schools attended by around 600,000 pupils will have access to support from these hubs, and the DfE said the programme is expected to support 5,000 schools, including intensive support for 500. Ms Phillipson said there was a particular concern about white working-class children, who have among the highest overall absence rates. She wrote in The Sunday Telegraph that \"for far too many white working-class children, opportunity is out of reach\", with statistics showing that \"one in 10 white children on free school meals were suspended last year, with suspension rates five times higher than their peers\". \n                  'We've sold toys, clothes, and even used my kids' birthday money': The parents struggling to feed kids during school holidays\n                 \n                  It's GCSE results day - and some students can get theirs via an app this year\n                 \n                  A-level results show deepening inequality despite vows to tackle attainment gaps\n                 \"These children are swimming upstream against a staggering, entrenched class divide that sees them disproportionately kicked out of education or not attending in the first place,\" the education secretary said. Ms Phillipson insisted that \"it is only this government that has the courage to upend a system that has resolutely failed white working-class children\".  The DfE is expected to set out more plans to tackle behaviour in a white paper due to be published in the autumn. The latest figures by the department show that while the overall absence rate was lower in autumn 202/25 than it was the previous year, the number of severely absent students - missing 50% or more - increased from 142,000 in autumn 2023/24 to 148,000 in autumn 2024/25. The DfE said data shows seven out of every 30 classroom minutes are lost to disruption. A survey by the NASUWT teaching union earlier this year found 81% of its members felt the number of pupils exhibiting violent and abusive behaviour at school had increased.

Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson will be on Sunday Morning with Trevor Phillips on Sky News from 8.30am on Sunday Ms Phillipson's call for parents to join an effort to improve attendance and behaviour has been welcomed by the Association of School and College Leaders (ASCL), whose general secretary, Pepe Di'Iasio, said: \"It is only through working collectively - families and school together - that we will get to grips with these issues.\" But Mr Di'Iasio said that the ASCL would like to see \"much more action from the government\" to support schools and colleges."

        "Content": "Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner should face an ethics inquiry over her tax affairs, the Conservatives have said. It comes after The Daily Telegraph claimed Ms Rayner, who is also housing secretary, avoided £40,000 in stamp duty on a second home in East Sussex by removing her name from the deeds of another property in Greater Manchester. Stamp duty is a tax paid in England and Northern Ireland when someone buys a property over a certain price. The newspaper also claimed Ms Rayner previously suggested the Greater Manchester home remained her primary residence, saving around £2,000 in council tax on her grace and favour home in central London. Conservative chairman Kevin Hollinrake has written to the independent adviser on ministerial standards, Sir Laurie Magnus, requesting he investigate whether Ms Rayner broke ministerial rules. In a letter to Sir Laurie, Mr Hollinrake described Ms Rayner's arrangements as \"hypocritical tax avoidance, by a minister who supports higher taxes on family homes, high-value homes and second homes\". As housing secretary, Ms Rayner is responsible for overseeing council tax and housing policy. \n                  Is the government preparing for a summer of riots? \n                 \n                  Unite votes to suspend Angela Rayner over Birmingham bin strike\n                 \n                  Reeves's tax turmoil deepens\n                 Read more from Sky News:Lib Dems eye Labour-held cities as they target 'seats not votes'Three arrests in Epping ahead of more protests Mr Hollinrake said the statements she had given on her residency were \"contradictory\", but conceded she had broken no laws.

        "Content": "Stethoscopes powered by artificial intelligence (AI) could help detect three different heart conditions in seconds, according to researchers. The traditional stethoscope, invented in 1816 to listen to the sounds inside a person's body, has been \"upgraded for the 21st century\" and used in a pilot involving more than 200 GP surgeries in London. The AI stethoscopes could be a \"real game-changer\", potentially allowing patients with heart failure, heart valve disease and abnormal heart rhythms, also known as atrial fibrillation, to be treated sooner, the trial suggests. Researchers found that heart failure was 2.3 times more likely to be detected in patients over the next 12 months who benefited from the new technology compared to those who did not. Abnormal heartbeat patterns, which have no symptoms but can increase stroke risk, were 3.5 times more detectable with the stethoscopes, while heart valve disease was 1.9 times more detectable. The devices work by placing a playing card-sized monitor onto the patient's chest, which takes an electrocardiogram (EEG) to measure the electrical signals from the heart and uses a microphone to record the sound of blood flowing through the heart. Both sets of data are then sent to the cloud and analysed using AI that has been trained using similar information from tens of thousands of patients. The pilot, conducted by Imperial College London and Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust, could now be rolled out in south London, Sussex, and Wales. Addressing 'society's biggest killers' Professor Mike Lewis, scientific director for innovation at the National Institute for Health and Care Research, which supported the study, said: \"This tool could be a real game-changer for patients, bringing innovation directly into the hands of GPs. \"The AI stethoscope gives local clinicians the ability to spot problems earlier, diagnose patients in the community, and address some of the big killers in society.\" The trial compared 12,725 patients - some from 96 GP surgeries that used the new stethoscopes and others from 109 that did not use them. Patients involved in the research had symptoms such as breathlessness, fatigue, or leg or foot swelling, which are all signs of heart failure.

Majchrzak signed balls and towels for fans at Flushing Meadows after beating Russia's Karen Khachanov on Thursday. After interacting with several supporters, Majchrzak took his cap off and gave it to a young boy in the crowd.
