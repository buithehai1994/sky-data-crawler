        "Content": " Donald Trump has questioned Volodymyr Zelenskyy's competence and suggested Ukraine started the war against Russia which is \"20 times\" its size. The US president also said \"millions of people are dead because of three people\" - blaming Russian President Vladimir Putin, his White House predecessor Joe Biden, and Mr Zelenskyy, in that order. It comes a day after 35 people, including two children, were killed by two Russian missiles that struck the northeastern city of Sumy as Ukrainians gathered to celebrate Palm Sunday in what was the deadliest strike on the country so far this year, according to officials. Ukraine latest updates: Trump points finger over war Speaking in the White House's Oval Office during a meeting with El Salvador's President Nayib Bukele, Mr Trump told reporters: \"If Biden were competent, and if Zelenskyy were competent, and I don't know that he is... \"There was no way that war should never have been allowed to happen.\" He added: \"Biden could have stopped it, and Zelenskyy could have stopped it, and Putin should have never started it.\" \n                  Why Vladimir Putin seems to be raising the stakes\n                 \n                  At least 34 dead in Ukrainian city of Sumy after Russian missile strikes\n                 \n                  US envoy meets Putin for talks - as Trump urges Russia to 'get moving' on Ukraine\n                 Asked about Mr Zelenskyy, Mr Trump said: \"When you start a war you've got to know you can win the war. \"You don't start a war against somebody that's 20 times your size. And then hope that people give you some missiles.\" Mr Trump said he was the first to give Ukraine Javelin missiles. \"Millions of people are dead because of three people,\" Mr Trump added. \"Let's say Putin number one, let's say Biden, who had no idea what the hell he was doing, number two, and Zelenskyy. \"And all I can do is try and stop it - that's all I want to do. I want to stop the killing. \"And I think we're doing well in that regard. I think you'll have some very good proposals very soon.\" Mr Zelenskyy has called for a global response to the Sumy attack, in which more than 100 people were injured, saying the first strike hit university buildings while the second exploded above street level. On Monday, Ukraine's air force said a new Russian missile and guided bombs had targeted Sumy, but gave no indication of casualties or damage. Public broadcaster Suspilne reported an explosion in the city, with no further details. 'It's a horrible thing' Asked about Sunday's Sumy attack which is near the Russian border, Mr Trump earlier said on board Air Force One: \"I think it was terrible and I was told they made a mistake, but I think it's a horrible thing. I think the whole war is a horrible thing.\"  When questioned about the incident, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Russia's forces only strike military targets. The strike targeted a gathering of senior military officers, according to the defence ministry in Moscow which accused Kyiv of using civilians as shields by holding military meetings in the city centre. The ministry also claimed to have killed more than 60 troops. Russia did not provide any evidence to support its claims. Polish foreign minister Radek Sikorski, whose country currently holds the EU's presidency, said that recent attacks are \"Russia's mocking answer\" to Kyiv's agreement to a ceasefire proposed by the US administration over a month ago.

The attack on Sumy followed a missile strike on 4 April on Mr Zelenskyy's home city of Kryvyi Rih that killed some 20 people, including nine children. Russia and Ukraine's senior diplomats have accused each other of violating a tentative US-brokered deal to pause strikes on energy infrastructure. Ukraine has endorsed a broader US ceasefire proposal, but Russia has effectively blocked it by imposing far-reaching conditions. Mr Putin has said he wants Ukraine to drop its ambitions to join NATO, Russia to control the entirety of the four Ukrainian regions it has claimed as its own, and the size of the Ukrainian army to be limited. He has also made clear he wants Western sanctions eased."

        "Headline": "There had been concern that the coking coal and iron ore needed to keep the blast furnaces running may not have arrived before they started to cool down - after which it becomes extremely difficult to start them up again.",
        "Content": "The raw materials needed to keep the blast furnaces running at British Steel's Scunthorpe plant will be delivered to the site today, the government has confirmed. Ministers have been racing against time to secure the coking coal and iron ore needed to keep the furnaces at the UK's last virgin steel-producing plant operating. If they cool down too much, the molten iron solidifies and blocks the furnaces, making it extremely difficult and expensive to restart them. Jonathan Reynolds, the business secretary, will visit the port in nearby Immingham as the supplies from two ships are unloaded and transported to the plant. The Department for Business and Trade (DBT) said the materials had been provided by the US and would be enough to keep the furnaces running for weeks, while a third ship with coking coal and iron ore is on its way from Australia after a legal dispute between British Steel and the site's Chinese owner Jingye was resolved. The future of the British Steel plant at Scunthorpe had been hanging in the balance after Jingye decided to cancel future orders for the iron ore, coal and other raw materials needed to keep the furnaces running at the beginning of April. After talks with the owner broke down, the government summoned MPs who had been away from Westminster for the Easter recess back to parliament to pass an emergency bill on Saturday to take over the facility. The bill has brought the steelworks into effective government control, with the next step expected to be nationalisation. Mr Reynolds said: \"Thanks to the work of those at British Steel, and in my department, we have moved decisively to secure the raw materials we need to help save British Steel. \"Our industries depend on UK steel and - thanks to our plan for change - demand is set to shoot up: helping build the 1.5 million homes, railways, schools and hospitals we need to usher in a decade of national renewal.\"  Jingye's decision to cancel future orders of the raw materials needed to keep the furnaces running has led some to question whether the company might have purposefully attempted to shut the blast furnaces down. While Downing Street said it was not aware of \"sabotage\" at the plant, it did acknowledge that it had become \"clear\" the Chinese owners \"wanted to shut the blast furnaces\" during talks. Mr Reynolds said \"it might not be sabotage, it might be neglect\", while Ms Rayner said there was \"no evidence\" of corporate sabotage. However, the episode has sparked a debate about Chinese involvement in UK industries, with Mr Reynolds saying on Sunday that he \"wouldn't personally bring a Chinese company into our steel sector\". The Chinese company stepped in with a deal to buy British Steel's Scunthorpe plant out of insolvency five years ago. Commenting on the situation for the first time on Monday, a Chinese embassy spokesperson urged the British government not to \"politicise\" the row by \"linking it to security issues\", and to act with \"fairness, impartiality and non-discrimination... to make sure the legitimate rights and interests of the Chinese company be protected\". Read more:Why has the government rescued British SteelMP denied entry to Hong Kong speaks of her 'chilling' treatment \"It is an objective fact that British steel companies have generally encountered difficulties in recent years,\" it added. UK ministers have faced questions themselves over why they have only just acted on British Steel, given the fact that unions warned earlier this month that Jingye had decided to cancel future orders for the vital raw materials. The Conservatives accused the government of acting \"too late\" and implementing a \"botched nationalisation\" after ignoring warnings about the risk to the steelworks. Under the new legislation passed at the weekend, ministers now have the power to instruct British Steel to keep the plant in Scunthorpe open, order materials for steelmaking and instruct that workers be paid. It also authorises a jail sentence of up to two years for anyone who breaches this law."

Warning - content may be upsetting Tens of thousands of people, including diarist Anne Frank, died at the camp in northern Germany, which was liberated by British troops on 15 April 1945. Mala Tribich, who was around 14 when she was deported to the camp with her younger cousin, said she still remembers what she went through there, because \"you don't forget that\".  Mrs Tribich, who spent less than three months there, said she hopes that \"nothing like that will ever happen again, and of course, it's up to us to guard against it, and I hope that some people have learned the lessons. \"We have seen that it could happen again, and we must take every step not to let it. \"The world is different today.

Her mother and eight-year-old sister were murdered by the Nazis in a local forest before she was taken to the Ravensbruck concentration camp with her younger cousin in November 1944.  Stripped of her identity Their clothes were taken and their heads shaved. They were \"stripped of their identity,\" she said. That caused people to \"lose hope, and without hope, you can't survive, people give up and it showed itself very quickly\". After about 10 weeks, Ms Tribich and her cousin were transported in cattle trucks to Bergen-Belsen, where, along with a \"terrible smell\", she found people who looked \"like skeletons\" and \"piles of corpses... it was horrific\".  They moved to a children's home in the camp, which was \"a real bit of luck because we wouldn't have survived in the main camp\". She was so sick from typhus that she does not remember much of liberation day, but eventually reunited with her brother, Ben, in England in March 1947. King urged her to write a book Now living in London, she has a framed photo of herself speaking with the King, who, when they met, urged her to write a book about her experiences because \"it's really very important that all these things are put down because you will forget them\".

        "Content": "\n          Climate reporter\n              @SeabrookClimate\n 'Tropical nights' might sound like a beach-side party, or a refreshing cocktail, but the reality is less entertaining. In fact, tropical nights - when temperatures don't dip below 20C - have become an increasingly common, sweaty fixture in Europe since the 1980s, and it's disrupting both lives and holidays in unexpected ways. Last year, southern European summer destinations - including the sun-drenched shores of southern Italy, Croatia, Turkey and Greece - sweltered through a record-breaking 23 tropical nights, according to new data. That's nearly three times the average of just eight, and far above the previous record of 16 in 2012, the EU's Copernicus Climate Change Service said. Tropical nights mean a sleepless, sticky time in bed, when sweaty sheets cling to skin and opening windows brings no respite. Dann Mitchell from the UK's Met Office said nighttime temperatures are \"really important for our health\" because it's the part of each day when we recover. And if it can't do that, it brings a \"whole host of issues\", he warned. These sweltering figures came in what was the hottest year ever in Europe. But they aren't a one-off. Climate change is making the atmosphere warmer, bringing 'heat stress' in the day as well as at night. \n                  The good, the bad and the ugly in Donald Trump's coal plans\n                 \n                  March hottest on record in Europe - with warnings of 'harsher heat waves and wildfires' this summer\n                 \n                  Luton Airport expansion plans approved by transport secretary\n                 Last year there were also 66 days of 'strong heat stress' across southern Europe - when daily temperatures reach a 'feels-like' temperature of 32°C or higher - far surpassing the average of 29 days. The price of sleepless nights Soaring daytime highs paired with sultry nights are pushing the limits of human comfort - and health. Madeleine Thomson, Head of Climate Impacts & Adaptation at health research foundation Wellcome, said: \"Europe is heating up, and we're not prepared for the toll this will take on our health.\" \"Deaths from heat stress are the most visible impact. But extreme heat doesn't just kill - it also increases the risk of heart disease, pregnancy complications, and poor mental health.\" In Britain's scorching summer of 2022, an extra 2,800 people aged over 65 are estimated to have died from heat-related reasons. Children are especially vulnerable because they are small and so warm up faster. Pregnant women, whose bodies already struggle with temperature regulation, are also at risk. While air conditioning \"helps us to survive\", it is energy intensive, increasingly unaffordable, and can lead to power blackouts when the system is overloaded, said Ilan Kelman, professor of disasters and health from Reading University. Earth, wine and fire But it's not just tourists who are feeling the heat. \"The economic consequences are profound,\" said Dr Hannah Cloke, a hydrologist at Reading University, including for farmers grappling with withering crops and crusty soils. Wine harvests were down last year, variously described by the industry as \"dismal\" and \"horrible\". Meanwhile while olive trees were parched by heat and drought, pavements in Italy melted, and a fire near Athens burned almost 11,000 hectares (110 km2). Holiday company Intrepid Travel said it has \"definitely seen an increase in the severity and frequency of extreme weather events impacting our trips in Europe\". It is adapting to this \"new reality\" by scrapping hiking holidays in Turkey in July and August and running new summer trips to Scandinavia - with bookings from Brits up 40% last year. Google told Sky News it had detected a new, rapidly growing trend for searches like \"summer holiday in Europe not too hot\" and \"what summer holiday destinations do not have risk of wildfires in July\". A hotter future The record-breaking summer of 2024 may have been extreme, but it's part of a long term shift, said Copernicus. Europe is the fastest-warming continent, warming twice as fast as the global average - partly due to its overlap with the Arctic. The weather still varies wildly, so scientists can't predict the exact number of tropical nights or heat waves this year, but they are confident in the trend. Madeleine Thomson, head of climate impacts at Wellcome, said: \"We urgently need to cut emissions and adapt our cities. Simple changes, like adding green spaces and waterways, can help cool urban areas and protect public health.\""

        "Content": " A long-running strike by bin workers, that has left rubbish piling up on Birmingham's streets, will continue after union members \"overwhelmingly rejected\" the city council's offer in a fresh ballot. The action by members of Unite, which began on 11 March as part of a dispute over pay, has seen thousands of tonnes of rubbish go uncollected and warnings of a public health emergency. Hundreds of workers have been on all-out strike for a month, and residents have complained about \"rats as big as cats\". Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner visited Birmingham last week and called on the union to accept a \"significantly improved\" deal for workers. However, the union said hundreds of its members had rejected the \"totally inadequate\" offer. The offer, if it had been accepted, would have included \"substantial pay cuts for workers\" and \"did not address potential pay cuts for 200 drivers\", according to Unite. The latest ballot comes after previous talks failed. Unite has been campaigning against plans to cut the post of waste recycling and collection officer (WRCO) from the city's refuse and recycling service. The union claims it will lead to around 150 of its members having their pay cut by up to £8,000 a year. But the council has disputed the figures, saying only 17 workers will be affected, losing far less than Unite is claiming. Local government minister Jim McMahon said the union's rejection of the pay offer will be \"deeply disappointing for Birmingham residents who have already endured weeks of disruption\". \"There is a fair and reasonable offer on the table and I would urge Unite to end the strikes and return to talks to reach the resolution that is fair to the workers and residents of the city,\" he added.  'Rejection of the offer is no surprise' Unite general secretary Sharon Graham said: \"The rejection of the offer is no surprise as these workers simply cannot afford to take pay cuts of this magnitude to pay the price for bad decision after bad decision.\" Unite national lead Onay Kasab told Sky News: \"The proposal from the employers was completely and utterly inadequate. It still included a pay cut. It included a sharp cliff-edge drop in pay for our members. \"Unfortunately, the biggest thing about the proposal was what it didn't include. It didn't include the details of how and when the drivers are going to have their pay cut and what's going to be done to mitigate that. It didn't include issues around what happens if people finish their training and there are no vacancies for them. \"But what it did show up was this so-called figure of only 17 people being impacted is complete and utter nonsense. The proposal itself, that we've got in paper, impacts more than 17 people.\" 👉 Listen to Sky News Daily on your podcast app 👈 Wendy Morton, a Conservative MP whose Aldridge-Brownhills constituency is in the Walsall borough, said rats in Birmingham - labelled Squeaky Blinders - \"must be dancing in the streets\". She said: \"This really shows yet again Labour-led Birmingham Council and this Labour government are failing residents and our region. \"They need to get a grip, stop blaming others, and face the unions - their paymasters. The Squeaky Blinders must be dancing in the streets.\" Rats have been seen scurrying around mounting piles of rubbish, food waste and bin bags outside homes, shops and restaurants in the city since the strike began. 'It has been really bad' A Birmingham resident whose car was wrecked by rats in a street where piles of rubbish were \"as tall as\" him is \"disappointed\" bin workers have rejected the council's offer. Adam Yasin, 33, from the Balsall Heath area of the city, said: \"It's more to do with hygiene on the streets. I take my son to the nursery and I use a specific street and honestly it was blocked. It's just annoying, and when the kids are there they like to touch things as well.\" He said his Mercedes was \"completely written off\" just weeks ago because rats had chewed through wires in the engine. He said: \"It has been really bad, especially where I live, there are a lot of restaurants there. I swear there was a pile (of rubbish) as tall as me, I kid you not. \"Today they collected the rubbish that was on the floor, so the bags that were on the floor, but the bins are still left.\" Read more:Hunting the rats running riotPest controllers 'feel like fourth emergency service'  What has the council said? Birmingham City Council said: \"It is incredibly disappointing, that despite several weeks of extensive negotiations, Unite have rejected a second offer of settlement. However, our door remains open. \"The council must deliver improved waste services for our citizens - who simply deserve better. \"We must also guard against future equal pay claims, and while we have sought throughout the negotiations to protect pay for individuals, Unite's proposals focus solely on retaining a role that does not exist in other councils and represents an equal pay risk for Birmingham. \"We have made a fair and reasonable offer and every employee affected by the removal of the WRCO role could take an equivalent graded role in the council, LGV Driver training or voluntary redundancy packages.\" It comes as the government called in military planners to help tackle the mounting piles of rubbish in Birmingham. Amid an \"ongoing public health risk\" posed by the mounds of waste, the planners have been assigned to provide logistical support for a short period. The move has not involved soldiers being deployed to collect rubbish. 'Army logistics deployed' Ms Rayner insisted there were \"no boots on the ground\". She said \"we've deployed a couple of army logistics to help with the logistical operation of clearing up the rubbish\". \"We've got over two-thirds of the rubbish cleared off the streets now, this week we'll start to see cleaning up the pavements and streets as well as the clearance of all of that rubbish, I'm very pleased about that. The kids are off school, obviously it's Easter holidays, we want that rubbish cleared.\" Waste collections have been disrupted since January, before the all-out strike started last month. Birmingham City Council declared a major incident on 31 March in response to public health concerns."

        "Content": "\n          Science and Technology reporter\n        Katy Perry has blasted off to space along with five other women in the first all-female space crew in over sixty years.  The Firework singer lifted off from West Texas on a Blue Origin rocket before becoming the first artist to sing in space. Flying alongside Perry were author Lauren Sanchez, the fiancee of Blue Origin owner and Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, journalist and TV presenter Gayle King, civil rights activist Amanda Nguyen, former rocket scientist Aisha Bowe, and filmmaker Kerianne Flynn.  The star-studded crew were supported on the ground by family and friends including Kris Jenner, Khloe Kardashian and Oprah Winfrey, who said she had \"never been more proud\" of her friend, King. \"There's only one time all the women are going up for the first time,\" Oprah said she told her friend when urging her to go on the flight, telling her she'd regret turning down the opportunity. Weightlessness The crew were weightless for just four minutes after passing the Karman line, a 62-mile-high boundary that is internationally recognised as the boundary of space. They could be heard screaming as they began to feel weightless, and told each other to look at the incredible views of the moon. As the crew were leaving space, Perry started to sing What a Wonderful World by Louis Armstrong.  Asked why she chose that song, she said: \"It's not about me or about me singing my songs, it was about a collective energy in there. \"It's about this wonderful world that we see right out there and appreciating it.\"  She confirmed she will be writing a song about the experience. Science correspondent A sassy crew, a billionaire and a celebrity circus in the desert. Space missions don't get any weirder. But this is the new world of Blue Origin and its publicity machine. It brought together six women - all at the top of their game - and dressed them in designer flight suits. One of them, singer Katy Perry, said they \"put the ass into astronauts\". They launched in a rocket called New Shepard, rising to 65 miles above the Earth, where they unbuckled and floated. Back on planet Earth there was a star-studded gathering. There were a couple of Kardashians. And Oprah Winfrey was there too, covering her eyes, barely able to look.

The descent Three parachutes on their capsule opened up to bring them safely back down to Earth and just before they landed, an air cushion blew a cloud of dust up in the west Texas desert, giving a dramatic-looking touchdown. \"Excited as I am, I'll be very glad when we come back down,\" said self-confessed nervous flier King before liftoff.

        "Content": "The UK will announce a £120m aid package for Sudan at a conference in London to mark the two-year anniversary of the conflict in the African country. Foreign Secretary David Lammy will host senior representatives from the African Union and EU nations at the summit on Tuesday, which will be attended by major donors and multilateral institutions. During the one-day conference, he will announce the new funding for the financial year 2025-26 to support more than 650,000 Sudanese people, who have been caught up in a bloody conflict between the army and the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) paramilitaries since 2023. Mr Lammy is expected to say: \"Two years is far too long - the brutal war in Sudan has devastated the lives of millions - and yet much of the world continues to look away. \"We need to act now to stop the crisis from becoming an all-out catastrophe, ensuring aid gets to those who need it the most.\" The foreign secretary said he visited Sudan's border earlier this year and \"the warring parties have shown an appalling disregard for the civilian population\".  \"This conference will bring together the international community to agree a pathway to end the suffering,\" he added. \"Instability must not spread - it drives migration from Sudan and the wider region, and a safe and stable Sudan is vital for our national security. The UK will not let Sudan be forgotten.\" The latest funding comes on top of a £113m aid package for the country announced by the UK government in November. The war in Sudan has left more than 30 million people in need of aid, while more than 12 million people have been displaced as famine spreads across the country, the UK Foreign Office said. Around 12 million women and girls are also at risk of gender-based violence, it added.

        "Content": "Donald Trump has suggested \"homegrown criminals\" in the US could be deported to jails in El Salvador – saying the US attorney general is \"studying the laws right now\". He made the comment while speaking alongside the Central American nation's president, Nayib Bukele, in the White House. The Trump administration has sent hundreds of alleged Venezuelan gang members to CECOT, a maximum security prison in El Salvador, since March. When asked about the deportations - which were briefly blocked by a US court last month - Mr Trump said: \"I'd like to go a step further. \"We also have homegrown criminals that push people into subways, hit elderly ladies on the back of the head when they're not looking, that are absolute monsters. \"I'd like to include them in people to get out of the country.\" When pressed on the matter by a reporter, he replied: \"They're as bad as anybody that comes in. We have bad ones too. I'm all for it.\" US Attorney General Pam Bondi, who was present at the meeting, is \"studying the laws right now\", the US president added. \"If we can do that, that's good,\" he said. \"I'm talking about violent people, really bad people. \"We can do things with the president [of El Salvador] for less money and have great security. He does a great job with that. We have other we're negotiating with too.\" News correspondent Nayib Bukele is a master of optics. His look was slick – a black suit and long-sleeve black t-shirt beneath – fitting for the man who's dubbed himself \"the world's coolest dictator\". And the Salvadorian president said all the right things, aligning his few chosen words with US priorities. \"How can I smuggle a terrorist into the United States?\" he replied, when asked if he'd be returning a prisoner deported by mistake. That will have gone down well in the White House. The Oval Office has become a diplomatic minefield since Donald Trump returned to power. Sir Keir Starmer's letter from the King was considered a masterstroke. Volodymyr Zelenskyy's scrutinising of foreign policy, quite the opposite. Others, like Ireland's premier Micheal Martin, said as little as possible while seated next to Trump. Bukele didn't say much either, opting for a touch of deference to \"the leader of the free world\". He wants to position El Salvador as a key player in the region, not just a small country in Latin America. His authoritarian leanings back home may appeal to the US president. And Bukele is savvy enough to milk that for all it's worth.

        "Content": "The raw materials needed to keep the blast furnaces running at British Steel's Scunthorpe plant will be delivered to the site today, the government has confirmed. Ministers have been racing against time to secure the coking coal and iron ore needed to keep the furnaces at the UK's last virgin steel-producing plant operating. If they cool down too much, the molten iron solidifies and blocks the furnaces, making it extremely difficult and expensive to restart them. Jonathan Reynolds, the business secretary, will visit the port in nearby Immingham as the supplies from two ships are unloaded and transported to the plant. The Department for Business and Trade (DBT) said the materials had been provided by the US and would be enough to keep the furnaces running for weeks, while a third ship with coking coal and iron ore is on its way from Australia after a legal dispute between British Steel and the site's Chinese owner Jingye was resolved. The future of the British Steel plant at Scunthorpe had been hanging in the balance after Jingye decided to cancel future orders for the iron ore, coal and other raw materials needed to keep the furnaces running at the beginning of April. After talks with the owner broke down, the government summoned MPs who had been away from Westminster for the Easter recess back to parliament to pass an emergency bill on Saturday to take over the facility. The bill has brought the steelworks into effective government control, with the next step expected to be nationalisation. Mr Reynolds said: \"Thanks to the work of those at British Steel, and in my department, we have moved decisively to secure the raw materials we need to help save British Steel. \"Our industries depend on UK steel and - thanks to our plan for change - demand is set to shoot up: helping build the 1.5 million homes, railways, schools and hospitals we need to usher in a decade of national renewal.\"  Jingye's decision to cancel future orders of the raw materials needed to keep the furnaces running has led some to question whether the company might have purposefully attempted to shut the blast furnaces down. While Downing Street said it was not aware of \"sabotage\" at the plant, it did acknowledge that it had become \"clear\" the Chinese owners \"wanted to shut the blast furnaces\" during talks. Mr Reynolds said \"it might not be sabotage, it might be neglect\", while Ms Rayner said there was \"no evidence\" of corporate sabotage. However, the episode has sparked a debate about Chinese involvement in UK industries, with Mr Reynolds saying on Sunday that he \"wouldn't personally bring a Chinese company into our steel sector\". The Chinese company stepped in with a deal to buy British Steel's Scunthorpe plant out of insolvency five years ago. Commenting on the situation for the first time on Monday, a Chinese embassy spokesperson urged the British government not to \"politicise\" the row by \"linking it to security issues\", and to act with \"fairness, impartiality and non-discrimination... to make sure the legitimate rights and interests of the Chinese company be protected\". Read more:Why has the government rescued British SteelMP denied entry to Hong Kong speaks of her 'chilling' treatment \"It is an objective fact that British steel companies have generally encountered difficulties in recent years,\" it added. UK ministers have faced questions themselves over why they have only just acted on British Steel, given the fact that unions warned earlier this month that Jingye had decided to cancel future orders for the vital raw materials. The Conservatives accused the government of acting \"too late\" and implementing a \"botched nationalisation\" after ignoring warnings about the risk to the steelworks. Under the new legislation passed at the weekend, ministers now have the power to instruct British Steel to keep the plant in Scunthorpe open, order materials for steelmaking and instruct that workers be paid. It also authorises a jail sentence of up to two years for anyone who breaches this law."

        "Content": " A long-running strike by bin workers, that has left rubbish piling up on Birmingham's streets, will continue after union members \"overwhelmingly rejected\" the city council's offer in a fresh ballot. The action by members of Unite, which began on 11 March as part of a dispute over pay, has seen thousands of tonnes of rubbish go uncollected and warnings of a public health emergency. Hundreds of workers have been on all-out strike for a month, and residents have complained about \"rats as big as cats\". Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner visited Birmingham last week and called on the union to accept a \"significantly improved\" deal for workers. However, the union said hundreds of its members had rejected the \"totally inadequate\" offer. The offer, if it had been accepted, would have included \"substantial pay cuts for workers\" and \"did not address potential pay cuts for 200 drivers\", according to Unite. The latest ballot comes after previous talks failed. Unite has been campaigning against plans to cut the post of waste recycling and collection officer (WRCO) from the city's refuse and recycling service. The union claims it will lead to around 150 of its members having their pay cut by up to £8,000 a year. But the council has disputed the figures, saying only 17 workers will be affected, losing far less than Unite is claiming. Local government minister Jim McMahon said the union's rejection of the pay offer will be \"deeply disappointing for Birmingham residents who have already endured weeks of disruption\". \"There is a fair and reasonable offer on the table and I would urge Unite to end the strikes and return to talks to reach the resolution that is fair to the workers and residents of the city,\" he added.  'Rejection of the offer is no surprise' Unite general secretary Sharon Graham said: \"The rejection of the offer is no surprise as these workers simply cannot afford to take pay cuts of this magnitude to pay the price for bad decision after bad decision.\" Unite national lead Onay Kasab told Sky News: \"The proposal from the employers was completely and utterly inadequate. It still included a pay cut. It included a sharp cliff-edge drop in pay for our members. \"Unfortunately, the biggest thing about the proposal was what it didn't include. It didn't include the details of how and when the drivers are going to have their pay cut and what's going to be done to mitigate that. It didn't include issues around what happens if people finish their training and there are no vacancies for them. \"But what it did show up was this so-called figure of only 17 people being impacted is complete and utter nonsense. The proposal itself, that we've got in paper, impacts more than 17 people.\" 👉 Listen to Sky News Daily on your podcast app 👈 Wendy Morton, a Conservative MP whose Aldridge-Brownhills constituency is in the Walsall borough, said rats in Birmingham - labelled Squeaky Blinders - \"must be dancing in the streets\". She said: \"This really shows yet again Labour-led Birmingham Council and this Labour government are failing residents and our region. \"They need to get a grip, stop blaming others, and face the unions - their paymasters. The Squeaky Blinders must be dancing in the streets.\" Rats have been seen scurrying around mounting piles of rubbish, food waste and bin bags outside homes, shops and restaurants in the city since the strike began. 'It has been really bad' A Birmingham resident whose car was wrecked by rats in a street where piles of rubbish were \"as tall as\" him is \"disappointed\" bin workers have rejected the council's offer. Adam Yasin, 33, from the Balsall Heath area of the city, said: \"It's more to do with hygiene on the streets. I take my son to the nursery and I use a specific street and honestly it was blocked. It's just annoying, and when the kids are there they like to touch things as well.\" He said his Mercedes was \"completely written off\" just weeks ago because rats had chewed through wires in the engine. He said: \"It has been really bad, especially where I live, there are a lot of restaurants there. I swear there was a pile (of rubbish) as tall as me, I kid you not. \"Today they collected the rubbish that was on the floor, so the bags that were on the floor, but the bins are still left.\" Read more:Hunting the rats running riotPest controllers 'feel like fourth emergency service'  What has the council said?

However, our door remains open. \"The council must deliver improved waste services for our citizens - who simply deserve better. \"We must also guard against future equal pay claims, and while we have sought throughout the negotiations to protect pay for individuals, Unite's proposals focus solely on retaining a role that does not exist in other councils and represents an equal pay risk for Birmingham. \"We have made a fair and reasonable offer and every employee affected by the removal of the WRCO role could take an equivalent graded role in the council, LGV Driver training or voluntary redundancy packages.\" It comes as the government called in military planners to help tackle the mounting piles of rubbish in Birmingham. Amid an \"ongoing public health risk\" posed by the mounds of waste, the planners have been assigned to provide logistical support for a short period. The move has not involved soldiers being deployed to collect rubbish. 'Army logistics deployed' Ms Rayner insisted there were \"no boots on the ground\". She said \"we've deployed a couple of army logistics to help with the logistical operation of clearing up the rubbish\". \"We've got over two-thirds of the rubbish cleared off the streets now, this week we'll start to see cleaning up the pavements and streets as well as the clearance of all of that rubbish, I'm very pleased about that. The kids are off school, obviously it's Easter holidays, we want that rubbish cleared.\" Waste collections have been disrupted since January, before the all-out strike started last month. Birmingham City Council declared a major incident on 31 March in response to public health concerns."

        "Content": "\n          Climate reporter\n              @SeabrookClimate\n 'Tropical nights' might sound like a beach-side party, or a refreshing cocktail, but the reality is less entertaining. In fact, tropical nights - when temperatures don't dip below 20C - have become an increasingly common, sweaty fixture in Europe since the 1980s, and it's disrupting both lives and holidays in unexpected ways. Last year, southern European summer destinations - including the sun-drenched shores of southern Italy, Croatia, Turkey and Greece - sweltered through a record-breaking 23 tropical nights, according to new data. That's nearly three times the average of just eight, and far above the previous record of 16 in 2012, the EU's Copernicus Climate Change Service said. Tropical nights mean a sleepless, sticky time in bed, when sweaty sheets cling to skin and opening windows brings no respite. Dann Mitchell from the UK's Met Office said nighttime temperatures are \"really important for our health\" because it's the part of each day when we recover. And if it can't do that, it brings a \"whole host of issues\", he warned. These sweltering figures came in what was the hottest year ever in Europe. But they aren't a one-off. Climate change is making the atmosphere warmer, bringing 'heat stress' in the day as well as at night. \n                  The good, the bad and the ugly in Donald Trump's coal plans\n                 \n                  March hottest on record in Europe - with warnings of 'harsher heat waves and wildfires' this summer\n                 \n                  Luton Airport expansion plans approved by transport secretary\n                 Last year there were also 66 days of 'strong heat stress' across southern Europe - when daily temperatures reach a 'feels-like' temperature of 32°C or higher - far surpassing the average of 29 days. The price of sleepless nights Soaring daytime highs paired with sultry nights are pushing the limits of human comfort - and health. Madeleine Thomson, Head of Climate Impacts & Adaptation at health research foundation Wellcome, said: \"Europe is heating up, and we're not prepared for the toll this will take on our health.\" \"Deaths from heat stress are the most visible impact. But extreme heat doesn't just kill - it also increases the risk of heart disease, pregnancy complications, and poor mental health.\" In Britain's scorching summer of 2022, an extra 2,800 people aged over 65 are estimated to have died from heat-related reasons. Children are especially vulnerable because they are small and so warm up faster. Pregnant women, whose bodies already struggle with temperature regulation, are also at risk. While air conditioning \"helps us to survive\", it is energy intensive, increasingly unaffordable, and can lead to power blackouts when the system is overloaded, said Ilan Kelman, professor of disasters and health from Reading University. Earth, wine and fire But it's not just tourists who are feeling the heat. \"The economic consequences are profound,\" said Dr Hannah Cloke, a hydrologist at Reading University, including for farmers grappling with withering crops and crusty soils. Wine harvests were down last year, variously described by the industry as \"dismal\" and \"horrible\". Meanwhile while olive trees were parched by heat and drought, pavements in Italy melted, and a fire near Athens burned almost 11,000 hectares (110 km2). Holiday company Intrepid Travel said it has \"definitely seen an increase in the severity and frequency of extreme weather events impacting our trips in Europe\". It is adapting to this \"new reality\" by scrapping hiking holidays in Turkey in July and August and running new summer trips to Scandinavia - with bookings from Brits up 40% last year. Google told Sky News it had detected a new, rapidly growing trend for searches like \"summer holiday in Europe not too hot\" and \"what summer holiday destinations do not have risk of wildfires in July\". A hotter future The record-breaking summer of 2024 may have been extreme, but it's part of a long term shift, said Copernicus. Europe is the fastest-warming continent, warming twice as fast as the global average - partly due to its overlap with the Arctic. The weather still varies wildly, so scientists can't predict the exact number of tropical nights or heat waves this year, but they are confident in the trend. Madeleine Thomson, head of climate impacts at Wellcome, said: \"We urgently need to cut emissions and adapt our cities. Simple changes, like adding green spaces and waterways, can help cool urban areas and protect public health.\""

        "Content": "The UK will announce a £120m aid package for Sudan at a conference in London to mark the two-year anniversary of the conflict in the African country. Foreign Secretary David Lammy will host senior representatives from the African Union and EU nations at the summit on Tuesday, which will be attended by major donors and multilateral institutions. During the one-day conference, he will announce the new funding for the financial year 2025-26 to support more than 650,000 Sudanese people, who have been caught up in a bloody conflict between the army and the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) paramilitaries since 2023. Mr Lammy is expected to say: \"Two years is far too long - the brutal war in Sudan has devastated the lives of millions - and yet much of the world continues to look away. \"We need to act now to stop the crisis from becoming an all-out catastrophe, ensuring aid gets to those who need it the most.\" The foreign secretary said he visited Sudan's border earlier this year and \"the warring parties have shown an appalling disregard for the civilian population\".  \"This conference will bring together the international community to agree a pathway to end the suffering,\" he added. \"Instability must not spread - it drives migration from Sudan and the wider region, and a safe and stable Sudan is vital for our national security. The UK will not let Sudan be forgotten.\" The latest funding comes on top of a £113m aid package for the country announced by the UK government in November. The war in Sudan has left more than 30 million people in need of aid, while more than 12 million people have been displaced as famine spreads across the country, the UK Foreign Office said. Around 12 million women and girls are also at risk of gender-based violence, it added.

        "Content": "Actress Samantha Davis, the wife of Warwick Davis, died after suffering a cardiac arrest hours before she was due to be discharged from hospital, an inquest has found.  Mrs Davis, 53, died at London's University College Hospital on 24 March last year. She had been admitted six and a half weeks earlier, after a disc prolapse caused a sudden loss of mobility in her lower limbs. She then underwent a thoracotomy operation - a surgical procedure where the chest wall is opened - on 20 February. Following a second thoracotomy on 14 March, Mrs Davis's condition improved and the hospital was planning to discharge her, the inquest at Inner West London Coroner's Court heard. However, she went into cardiac arrest at 11.25pm on 23 March, and was pronounced dead at 0.28am on 24 March, after a failed attempt to resuscitate her. Senior coroner Professor Fiona Wilcox said she was satisfied the cause of death \"should be arrhythmic cardiac arrest and complications following left thoracotomies\". Mrs Davis had achondroplasia, a bone growth disorder which results in dwarfism, \"complicated by very severe spinal problems\" requiring multiple surgeries from 2016, the coroner added. The hospital delivered \"nothing but excellent care\" and all of Mrs Davis's \"complications were appropriately managed\", Prof Wilcox said. \"It is frankly heartbreaking that the surgery itself was successful only for complications to arise and to cause her death,\" she added. David Lawrence, a cardiothoracic surgeon at University College London Hospitals, said Mrs Davis's condition had been \"progressing well\". During her hospital stay, she had two surgical chest drains removed - the second on the day she suffered the cardiac arrest, he said. \"Very sadly, on the night this happened, the original plan had been that she would be discharged home the following day,\" he told the inquest. \"We had good evidence that this patient had a chest x-ray that was acceptable, very stable observations and this patient did not bleed during the day.\" Read more:Katy Perry sings in spaceWhite Lotus star hits out at 'mean' joke Mr Davis, known for his film roles in the Star Wars and Harry Potter series, dedicated his BAFTA film fellowship award to Mrs Davis during an emotional tribute at the ceremony in February.

        "Content": " Friends and colleagues of Rory McIlroy have hailed his Masters victory to achieve a career Grand Slam as \"one of the greatest days in sport\" - as the golfer's psychologist revealed how he overcame an 11-year wait for another major. The Northern Irishman, 35, secured victory at the Masters to become only the sixth man to have won all four of golf's major championships. McIlroy had not won a major since the 2014 US PGA Championship - and his win at Augusta sparked emotional and jubilant scenes. Ryder Cup-winning captain Paul McGinley spoke to The UK Tonight with Sarah-Jane Mee about McIlroy's historic victory, saying: \"I think the human element is what brought people into it.\" He added: \"They all know the trials and tribulations Rory's had in the last couple of years, the near misses and the opportunities he's let slip through his fingers. \"Like a Hollywood movie, everyone loves a redemption story. \"It was quite extraordinary... it was sport at its best.\" McGinley said McIlroy's win \"had everything\" and was \"up there with one of the greatest days in sport I've ever seen\". 'I was weeping' Northern Irish actor James Nesbitt also reflected on the triumph, speaking to Mark Austin on Sky News's The News Hour. Nesbitt said: \"I couldn't be happier for anyone... I felt personally just overjoyed, I was weeping.\"  He told Sky News he received a text from actor Jamie Dornan \"saying he's never woken up happier, and he's got three daughters\". Nesbitt described how important McIlroy's win was for their shared home country, saying: \"Rory was always a beacon of hope, even though he was a young boy, because we looked for those things if Northern Ireland was to evolve. \"He seemed kind of emblematic of change, you know, and someone that put a smile on the faces of everyone here, everyone in Northern Ireland and the island of Ireland today would have woken up happy and proud.\" How McIlroy developed 'resilience' \"You never win the way you dream it,\" renowned sports psychologist Bob Rotella told Sky News, speaking about McIlroy's victory. Rotella was McIlroy's psychologist and they spoke throughout the tournament. \"Everyone's talking about his resilience, that's something he's worked really hard to develop,\" Rotella said.  McIlroy suffered an 11-year drought in major tournaments, coming close but falling at the last hurdle a number of times before his Masters victory. Rotella said: \"He's had to really accept that no matter how good you get at golf, no matter how talented you are, you're going to miss a lot of shots. \"We talk a lot about if you love golf, you've got to love that it's a game of mistakes.\" Ahead of the tournament, Rotella said he sent McIlroy a \"long text\" that they would sit down and discuss after each day in the tournament.

        "Content": " Donald Trump has questioned Volodymyr Zelenskyy's competence and suggested Ukraine started the war against Russia which is \"20 times\" its size. The US president also said \"millions of people are dead because of three people\" - blaming Russian President Vladimir Putin, his White House predecessor Joe Biden, and Mr Zelenskyy, in that order. It comes a day after 35 people, including two children, were killed by two Russian missiles that struck the northeastern city of Sumy as Ukrainians gathered to celebrate Palm Sunday in what was the deadliest strike on the country so far this year, according to officials. Ukraine latest updates: Trump points finger over war Speaking in the White House's Oval Office during a meeting with El Salvador's President Nayib Bukele, Mr Trump told reporters: \"If Biden were competent, and if Zelenskyy were competent, and I don't know that he is... \"There was no way that war should never have been allowed to happen.\" He added: \"Biden could have stopped it, and Zelenskyy could have stopped it, and Putin should have never started it.\" \n                  Why Vladimir Putin seems to be raising the stakes\n                 \n                  At least 34 dead in Ukrainian city of Sumy after Russian missile strikes\n                 \n                  US envoy meets Putin for talks - as Trump urges Russia to 'get moving' on Ukraine\n                 Asked about Mr Zelenskyy, Mr Trump said: \"When you start a war you've got to know you can win the war. \"You don't start a war against somebody that's 20 times your size. And then hope that people give you some missiles.\" Mr Trump said he was the first to give Ukraine Javelin missiles. \"Millions of people are dead because of three people,\" Mr Trump added. \"Let's say Putin number one, let's say Biden, who had no idea what the hell he was doing, number two, and Zelenskyy. \"And all I can do is try and stop it - that's all I want to do. I want to stop the killing. \"And I think we're doing well in that regard. I think you'll have some very good proposals very soon.\" Mr Zelenskyy has called for a global response to the Sumy attack, in which more than 100 people were injured, saying the first strike hit university buildings while the second exploded above street level. On Monday, Ukraine's air force said a new Russian missile and guided bombs had targeted Sumy, but gave no indication of casualties or damage. Public broadcaster Suspilne reported an explosion in the city, with no further details. 'It's a horrible thing' Asked about Sunday's Sumy attack which is near the Russian border, Mr Trump earlier said on board Air Force One: \"I think it was terrible and I was told they made a mistake, but I think it's a horrible thing. I think the whole war is a horrible thing.\"  When questioned about the incident, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Russia's forces only strike military targets. The strike targeted a gathering of senior military officers, according to the defence ministry in Moscow which accused Kyiv of using civilians as shields by holding military meetings in the city centre. The ministry also claimed to have killed more than 60 troops. Russia did not provide any evidence to support its claims. Polish foreign minister Radek Sikorski, whose country currently holds the EU's presidency, said that recent attacks are \"Russia's mocking answer\" to Kyiv's agreement to a ceasefire proposed by the US administration over a month ago.

The attack on Sumy followed a missile strike on 4 April on Mr Zelenskyy's home city of Kryvyi Rih that killed some 20 people, including nine children. Russia and Ukraine's senior diplomats have accused each other of violating a tentative US-brokered deal to pause strikes on energy infrastructure. Ukraine has endorsed a broader US ceasefire proposal, but Russia has effectively blocked it by imposing far-reaching conditions. Mr Putin has said he wants Ukraine to drop its ambitions to join NATO, Russia to control the entirety of the four Ukrainian regions it has claimed as its own, and the size of the Ukrainian army to be limited. He has also made clear he wants Western sanctions eased."

Warning - content may be upsetting Tens of thousands of people, including diarist Anne Frank, died at the camp in northern Germany, which was liberated by British troops on 15 April 1945. Mala Tribich, who was around 14 when she was deported to the camp with her younger cousin, said she still remembers what she went through there, because \"you don't forget that\".  Mrs Tribich, who spent less than three months there, said she hopes that \"nothing like that will ever happen again, and of course, it's up to us to guard against it, and I hope that some people have learned the lessons. \"We have seen that it could happen again, and we must take every step not to let it. \"The world is different today.

Her mother and eight-year-old sister were murdered by the Nazis in a local forest before she was taken to the Ravensbruck concentration camp with her younger cousin in November 1944.  Stripped of her identity Their clothes were taken and their heads shaved. They were \"stripped of their identity,\" she said. That caused people to \"lose hope, and without hope, you can't survive, people give up and it showed itself very quickly\". After about 10 weeks, Ms Tribich and her cousin were transported in cattle trucks to Bergen-Belsen, where, along with a \"terrible smell\", she found people who looked \"like skeletons\" and \"piles of corpses... it was horrific\".  They moved to a children's home in the camp, which was \"a real bit of luck because we wouldn't have survived in the main camp\". She was so sick from typhus that she does not remember much of liberation day, but eventually reunited with her brother, Ben, in England in March 1947. King urged her to write a book Now living in London, she has a framed photo of herself speaking with the King, who, when they met, urged her to write a book about her experiences because \"it's really very important that all these things are put down because you will forget them\". Mrs Tribich, who was made an MBE in 2012 for services to education, tells her story in schools and colleges across the UK through the Holocaust Educational Trust, which gives tens of thousands of young people every year the opportunity to hear the first-hand testimony of Holocaust survivors.

The war in Sudan has left more than 30 million people in need of aid, while more than 12 million people have been displaced as famine spreads across the country, the UK Foreign Office said. Around 12 million women and girls are also at risk of gender-based violence, it added.

        "Content": "\n          Science and Technology reporter\n        Katy Perry has blasted off to space along with five other women in the first all-female space crew in over sixty years.  The Firework singer lifted off from West Texas on a Blue Origin rocket before becoming the first artist to sing in space. Flying alongside Perry were author Lauren Sanchez, the fiancee of Blue Origin owner and Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, journalist and TV presenter Gayle King, civil rights activist Amanda Nguyen, former rocket scientist Aisha Bowe, and filmmaker Kerianne Flynn.  The star-studded crew were supported on the ground by family and friends including Kris Jenner, Khloe Kardashian and Oprah Winfrey, who said she had \"never been more proud\" of her friend, King. \"There's only one time all the women are going up for the first time,\" Oprah said she told her friend when urging her to go on the flight, telling her she'd regret turning down the opportunity. Weightlessness The crew were weightless for just four minutes after passing the Karman line, a 62-mile-high boundary that is internationally recognised as the boundary of space. They could be heard screaming as they began to feel weightless, and told each other to look at the incredible views of the moon. As the crew were leaving space, Perry started to sing What a Wonderful World by Louis Armstrong.  Asked why she chose that song, she said: \"It's not about me or about me singing my songs, it was about a collective energy in there. \"It's about this wonderful world that we see right out there and appreciating it.\"  She confirmed she will be writing a song about the experience.

It brought together six women - all at the top of their game - and dressed them in designer flight suits. One of them, singer Katy Perry, said they \"put the ass into astronauts\". They launched in a rocket called New Shepard, rising to 65 miles above the Earth, where they unbuckled and floated. Back on planet Earth there was a star-studded gathering. There were a couple of Kardashians. And Oprah Winfrey was there too, covering her eyes, barely able to look.

Read Thomas Moore's full analysis here. The descent Three parachutes on their capsule opened up to bring them safely back down to Earth and just before they landed, an air cushion blew a cloud of dust up in the west Texas desert, giving a dramatic-looking touchdown. \"Excited as I am, I'll be very glad when we come back down,\" said self-confessed nervous flier King before liftoff. When she exited the shuttle, the presenter kissed the floor and said: \"Thank you, Jesus\". She said it was \"oddly quiet\" in space, and it reminded her that people needed to \"do better and be better\" on Earth.

        "Content": "Donald Trump has suggested \"homegrown criminals\" in the US could be deported to jails in El Salvador – saying the US attorney general is \"studying the laws right now\". He made the comment while speaking alongside the Central American nation's president, Nayib Bukele, in the White House. The Trump administration has sent hundreds of alleged Venezuelan gang members to CECOT, a maximum security prison in El Salvador, since March. When asked about the deportations - which were briefly blocked by a US court last month - Mr Trump said: \"I'd like to go a step further. \"We also have homegrown criminals that push people into subways, hit elderly ladies on the back of the head when they're not looking, that are absolute monsters. \"I'd like to include them in people to get out of the country.\" When pressed on the matter by a reporter, he replied: \"They're as bad as anybody that comes in. We have bad ones too. I'm all for it.\" US Attorney General Pam Bondi, who was present at the meeting, is \"studying the laws right now\", the US president added. \"If we can do that, that's good,\" he said. \"I'm talking about violent people, really bad people. \"We can do things with the president [of El Salvador] for less money and have great security. He does a great job with that. We have other we're negotiating with too.\" News correspondent Nayib Bukele is a master of optics. His look was slick – a black suit and long-sleeve black t-shirt beneath – fitting for the man who's dubbed himself \"the world's coolest dictator\". And the Salvadorian president said all the right things, aligning his few chosen words with US priorities. \"How can I smuggle a terrorist into the United States?\" he replied, when asked if he'd be returning a prisoner deported by mistake. That will have gone down well in the White House. The Oval Office has become a diplomatic minefield since Donald Trump returned to power. Sir Keir Starmer's letter from the King was considered a masterstroke. Volodymyr Zelenskyy's scrutinising of foreign policy, quite the opposite. Others, like Ireland's premier Micheal Martin, said as little as possible while seated next to Trump. Bukele didn't say much either, opting for a touch of deference to \"the leader of the free world\". He wants to position El Salvador as a key player in the region, not just a small country in Latin America. His authoritarian leanings back home may appeal to the US president. And Bukele is savvy enough to milk that for all it's worth.

        "Content": "Sean \"Diddy\" Combs has pleaded not guilty to additional charges of sex trafficking and transportation to engage in prostitution, which were added to the indictment against him earlier in April. The new allegations take the total number of criminal charges against the rap mogul to five - following the three original counts, which also included racketeering conspiracy, filed in September. Combs, 55, has already pleaded not guilty to the original charges and strenuously denied all allegations against him. He appeared in court on Monday to enter his additional plea before US District Judge Arun Subramanian in Manhattan, New York. Combs, with grey hair and a goatee, and wearing tan prison clothing over a white thermal shirt, was more subdued than in previous hearings. Today's hearing also saw Combs' lawyers suggest they may request a two-week adjournment for his trial, scheduled for May, if they do not receive certain critical evidence from prosecutors. Combs' lawyer, Teny Geragos, said the defence had not been sent some 200,000 emails between the rapper and one of the alleged victims. Assistant US attorney Christie Slavik said prosecutors oppose any delay and accused Combs' lawyers of using \"gamesmanship\" to delay the trial. Judge Subramanian admonished the defence, saying: \"We are on a freight train speeding towards trial, if you want an adjournment, you need to make that application within the next forty-eight hours.\" Both sides will be back in court for another hearing on Friday. Addressing the additional charges in a statement, lawyers for Combs previously said: \"These are not new allegations or new accusers. These are the same individuals... who were involved in consensual relationships.\" Prosecutors claim the rapper and producer used his business empire to sexually abuse women between 2004 and 2024. He has been accused of organising \"freak offs\" - allegedly inducing women and male sex workers into drug-fuelled sexual performances. Combs has denied allegations of wrongdoing, saying all relationships and sexual encounters were consensual. His trial is due to start on 5 May, with jury selection expected to take about a week before the opening statements, which are scheduled to begin on 12 May.

Mr Noboa's opponent, leftist lawyer Luisa Gonzalez, has vowed to seek a recount over what she described as \"grotesque\" electoral fraud. Figures released by Ecuador's National Electoral Council indicate Mr Noboa received 55.8% of the vote with more than 90% of ballots counted, while Ms Gonzalez earned 44%. The vote was monitored by international observers from the European Union and the Organization of American States, but neither had released their official reports at the time of writing. Diana Atamaint, president of the council, said on national television that those results showed an \"irreversible trend\" in favour of Mr Noboa. The win gives the 37-year-old president four years to fulfil promises he first made in 2023 - when he won a snap election and secured a 16-month presidency despite having limited political experience.

She told supporters her campaign \"does not recognise the results presented by the \"(National Electoral Council),\" arguing, among other issues, that pre-election polls showed her ahead of Mr Noboa. Mr Noboa, heir to a fortune built on the banana trade, is expected to continue applying some of his heavy-handed crimefighting strategies that part of the electorate finds appealing but which have tested the limits of laws and norms of governing. Ecuador faces a challenge because of the involvement on its soil of two of Mexico's most notorious and powerful drugs cartels - Sinaloa and Jalisco New Generation. The cartels realised that Ecuador - which is not a cocaine producing country - had excellent ports with speedy routes north by sea to Central and North America. Mr Noboa declared Ecuador to be in a state of \"internal armed conflict\" in January 2024, allowing him to deploy thousands of soldiers to the streets to combat gangs and charge people with terrorism counts for alleged ties to organised crime groups. In the weeks that followed, Ecuador's security forces carried out raid after raid, rounding up people they claimed were linked to drug gangs.

However, during the crackdown there have also been reports of human rights violations, with the security forces having carried out extrajudicial killings and arbitrary arrests, according to Human Rights Watch. Under Mr Noboa's watch, the homicide rate dropped from 46.18 per 100,000 people in 2023, to 38.76 per 100,000 people in 2024. But despite the decrease, the rate remained far higher than the 6.85 homicides per 100,000 people seen in 2019. Ecuadorian voters were primarily worried about the violence that has transformed the country, starting in 2021. Both candidates promised tough-on-crime policies, better equipment for law enforcement and international help to fight drug cartels and local criminal groups. The candidates had advanced to Sunday's contest after getting the most votes in February's first-round election. Mr Noboa led Ms Gonzalez by around 17,000 votes."

And then hope that people give you some missiles.\" Mr Trump said he was the first to give Ukraine Javelin missiles. \"Millions of people are dead because of three people,\" Mr Trump added. \"Let's say Putin number one, let's say Biden, who had no idea what the hell he was doing, number two, and Zelenskyy. \"And all I can do is try and stop it - that's all I want to do. I want to stop the killing. \"And I think we're doing well in that regard. I think you'll have some very good proposals very soon.\" Mr Zelenskyy has called for a global response to the Sumy attack, in which more than 100 people were injured, saying the first strike hit university buildings while the second exploded above street level. On Monday, Ukraine's air force said a new Russian missile and guided bombs had targeted Sumy, but gave no indication of casualties or damage. Public broadcaster Suspilne reported an explosion in the city, with no further details. 'It's a horrible thing' Asked about Sunday's Sumy attack which is near the Russian border, Mr Trump earlier said on board Air Force One: \"I think it was terrible and I was told they made a mistake, but I think it's a horrible thing. I think the whole war is a horrible thing.\"  When questioned about the incident, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Russia's forces only strike military targets. The strike targeted a gathering of senior military officers, according to the defence ministry in Moscow which accused Kyiv of using civilians as shields by holding military meetings in the city centre. The ministry also claimed to have killed more than 60 troops. Russia did not provide any evidence to support its claims. Polish foreign minister Radek Sikorski, whose country currently holds the EU's presidency, said that recent attacks are \"Russia's mocking answer\" to Kyiv's agreement to a ceasefire proposed by the US administration over a month ago.

Russia and Ukraine's senior diplomats have accused each other of violating a tentative US-brokered deal to pause strikes on energy infrastructure. Ukraine has endorsed a broader US ceasefire proposal, but Russia has effectively blocked it by imposing far-reaching conditions. Mr Putin has said he wants Ukraine to drop its ambitions to join NATO, Russia to control the entirety of the four Ukrainian regions it has claimed as its own, and the size of the Ukrainian army to be limited. He has also made clear he wants Western sanctions eased."

        "Content": "Donald Trump has suggested \"homegrown criminals\" in the US could be deported to jails in El Salvador – saying the US attorney general is \"studying the laws right now\". He made the comment while speaking alongside the Central American nation's president, Nayib Bukele, in the White House. The Trump administration has sent hundreds of alleged Venezuelan gang members to CECOT, a maximum security prison in El Salvador, since March. When asked about the deportations - which were briefly blocked by a US court last month - Mr Trump said: \"I'd like to go a step further. \"We also have homegrown criminals that push people into subways, hit elderly ladies on the back of the head when they're not looking, that are absolute monsters. \"I'd like to include them in people to get out of the country.\" When pressed on the matter by a reporter, he replied: \"They're as bad as anybody that comes in. We have bad ones too. I'm all for it.\" US Attorney General Pam Bondi, who was present at the meeting, is \"studying the laws right now\", the US president added. \"If we can do that, that's good,\" he said. \"I'm talking about violent people, really bad people. \"We can do things with the president [of El Salvador] for less money and have great security. He does a great job with that. We have other we're negotiating with too.\" News correspondent Nayib Bukele is a master of optics. His look was slick – a black suit and long-sleeve black t-shirt beneath – fitting for the man who's dubbed himself \"the world's coolest dictator\". And the Salvadorian president said all the right things, aligning his few chosen words with US priorities. \"How can I smuggle a terrorist into the United States?\" he replied, when asked if he'd be returning a prisoner deported by mistake. That will have gone down well in the White House. The Oval Office has become a diplomatic minefield since Donald Trump returned to power. Sir Keir Starmer's letter from the King was considered a masterstroke. Volodymyr Zelenskyy's scrutinising of foreign policy, quite the opposite. Others, like Ireland's premier Micheal Martin, said as little as possible while seated next to Trump. Bukele didn't say much either, opting for a touch of deference to \"the leader of the free world\". He wants to position El Salvador as a key player in the region, not just a small country in Latin America. His authoritarian leanings back home may appeal to the US president. And Bukele is savvy enough to milk that for all it's worth.

        "Content": "Sean \"Diddy\" Combs has pleaded not guilty to additional charges of sex trafficking and transportation to engage in prostitution, which were added to the indictment against him earlier in April. The new allegations take the total number of criminal charges against the rap mogul to five - following the three original counts, which also included racketeering conspiracy, filed in September. Combs, 55, has already pleaded not guilty to the original charges and strenuously denied all allegations against him. He appeared in court on Monday to enter his additional plea before US District Judge Arun Subramanian in Manhattan, New York. Combs, with grey hair and a goatee, and wearing tan prison clothing over a white thermal shirt, was more subdued than in previous hearings. Today's hearing also saw Combs' lawyers suggest they may request a two-week adjournment for his trial, scheduled for May, if they do not receive certain critical evidence from prosecutors. Combs' lawyer, Teny Geragos, said the defence had not been sent some 200,000 emails between the rapper and one of the alleged victims. Assistant US attorney Christie Slavik said prosecutors oppose any delay and accused Combs' lawyers of using \"gamesmanship\" to delay the trial. Judge Subramanian admonished the defence, saying: \"We are on a freight train speeding towards trial, if you want an adjournment, you need to make that application within the next forty-eight hours.\" Both sides will be back in court for another hearing on Friday. Addressing the additional charges in a statement, lawyers for Combs previously said: \"These are not new allegations or new accusers. These are the same individuals... who were involved in consensual relationships.\" Prosecutors claim the rapper and producer used his business empire to sexually abuse women between 2004 and 2024. He has been accused of organising \"freak offs\" - allegedly inducing women and male sex workers into drug-fuelled sexual performances. Combs has denied allegations of wrongdoing, saying all relationships and sexual encounters were consensual. His trial is due to start on 5 May, with jury selection expected to take about a week before the opening statements, which are scheduled to begin on 12 May.

        "Content": "\n          Science and Technology reporter\n        Katy Perry has blasted off to space along with five other women in the first all-female space crew in over sixty years.  The Firework singer lifted off from West Texas on a Blue Origin rocket before becoming the first artist to sing in space. Flying alongside Perry were author Lauren Sanchez, the fiancee of Blue Origin owner and Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, journalist and TV presenter Gayle King, civil rights activist Amanda Nguyen, former rocket scientist Aisha Bowe, and filmmaker Kerianne Flynn.  The star-studded crew were supported on the ground by family and friends including Kris Jenner, Khloe Kardashian and Oprah Winfrey, who said she had \"never been more proud\" of her friend, King. \"There's only one time all the women are going up for the first time,\" Oprah said she told her friend when urging her to go on the flight, telling her she'd regret turning down the opportunity. Weightlessness The crew were weightless for just four minutes after passing the Karman line, a 62-mile-high boundary that is internationally recognised as the boundary of space. They could be heard screaming as they began to feel weightless, and told each other to look at the incredible views of the moon. As the crew were leaving space, Perry started to sing What a Wonderful World by Louis Armstrong.  Asked why she chose that song, she said: \"It's not about me or about me singing my songs, it was about a collective energy in there. \"It's about this wonderful world that we see right out there and appreciating it.\"  She confirmed she will be writing a song about the experience.

When she exited the shuttle, the presenter kissed the floor and said: \"Thank you, Jesus\". She said it was \"oddly quiet\" in space, and it reminded her that people needed to \"do better and be better\" on Earth.

Nikita Casap, 17, from Wisconsin, was charged last month with two counts of first-degree intentional homicide following the deaths of his mother, Tatiana Casap, and his stepfather, Donald Mayer. Waukesha County District Attorney Lesli Boese said Casap shot his mother at least three times - twice in the stomach and once in the neck - on 11 February, Sky News' US partner network NBC News reports. Prosecutors said the teenager killed Mr Mayer by shooting him in the back of the head the same day, according to US media reports. Casap allegedly went to school the next day and continued to live at home with the bodies until 23 February. Authorities allege he fled with $14,000 (£10,625) in cash, passports and the family dog. Ms Casap and Mr Mayer's bodies were found in a state of decay on 28 February after Mr Mayer's mother - who had not heard from him in weeks - called the sheriff's office for a welfare check. \n                  Donald Trump blames Volodymyr Zelenskyy for starting Ukraine war - a day after dozens killed in Russian missile strikes\n                 \n                  Donald Trump says the US could deport 'homegrown criminals' to El Salvador jail\n                 \n                  Will Trump deport American criminals?\n                 Casap was arrested the same day after running a stop sign while driving Mr Mayer's Volkswagen Atlas in WaKeeney, Kansas, 800 miles away from his Wisconsin home. The teenager, who is in custody at the Waukesha County jail in Wisconsin on a $1m bond (£757,720), is due in court next month to enter a plea. He is also facing two counts of hiding a corpse, a charge regarding theft of property over $10,000 (£7,577) and two charges of misappropriating ID to obtain money. More details about the allegations against Casap have now emerged after they were outlined in an FBI warrant which was unsealed on Friday. It states that Casap allegedly wrote a manifesto \"calling for the assassination of the President of the United States\". \"He was in touch with other parties about his plan to kill the President and overthrow the government of the United States,\" the search warrant continues. \"The killing of his parents appeared to be an effort to obtain the financial means and autonomy necessary to carrying out his plan.\" It is alleged Casap outlined reasons for wanting to kill Mr Trump in a three-page antisemitic manifesto praising Adolf Hitler. The warrant filed at the federal court in Milwaukee also contains excerpts of communications on TikTok and the Telegram messenger app. In court, prosecutors alleged Casap was in touch with a person who speaks Russian and shared a plan to flee to Ukraine.

Citing Casap's writings, the federal warrant says the teenager wanted to spur governmental collapse by \"by getting rid of the president and perhaps the vice president\". Casap's public defender, Nicole Ostrowski, moved to dismiss some of the charges, including theft, against her client last month. She argued that prosecutors had not laid out their case. She has also noted her client's age during court proceedings. \"He is young, he is still in high school,\" she said on 12 March. Meanwhile, prosecutors said in court that Ms Casap and Mr Mayer's bodies were so badly decomposed they had to be identified through dental records."

        "Content": "\n          City editor\n              @MarkKleinmanSky\n The company which prints banknotes for the Bank of England is on the brink of an historic takeover that would see it owned by private equity investors for the first time since it was founded 212 years ago. Sky News has learnt that Atlas Holdings, a US-based buyout firm, is in advanced talks about a 130p-a-share offer for De La Rue. The London-listed company's leading investors are understood to have been asked to provide irrevocable undertakings to accept the offer, with one shareholder saying that a deal recommended by De La Rue's board was likely to be announced as early as Tuesday morning. If completed, a takeover deal would end nearly 80 years of De La Rue's status as a London Stock Exchange-listed business, having made its public company debut in 1947. Headquartered in Greenwich, Connecticut, Atlas Holdings focuses on acquiring companies in sectors such as industrials, trading and energy. Among the businesses it owns in Europe are London-based graphic and creative services agency ASG and Bovis, a British construction services group. Banking sources said the 130p-a-share offer for De La Rue would represent a robust premium to a price which sank below 50p in mid-2023, but which has since recovered to close at 112p on Monday evening. \n                  Reform UK treasurer Candy sweet on merger of payments firms\n                 \n                  From Shanghai to Scunthorpe - what's China's influence on UK industry?  \n                 \n                  Money: Sony hikes price of PlayStation 25%\n                 Atlas Holdings is understood to have drafted in bankers from Lazard to advise it, while De La Rue is being advised by Deutsche Numis. The offer from Atlas Holdings does not include De La Rue's authentication division, which is being sold to US-listed Crane NXT in a £300m transaction which took a further step towards completion last week. The proceeds from that deal have been earmarked to repay loans and reduce its pension scheme deficit. De La Rue's currency arm prints money for a large number of central banks around the world, including in the Americas, Asia, Africa and Europe. It has printing sites in the UK, Kenya, Malta and Sri Lanka. In 2020, the Bank of England announced that it had extended De La Rue's contract from the end of 2025 until 2028. At the time, there were 4.4bn Bank of England notes in circulation with a collective value of about £82bn. De La Rue has been running a formal sale process under Takeover Panel rules, with a string of parties said to have expressed an interest in it since the period began late last year. Among its potential suitors has been Edi Truell, the prominent City financier and pensions entrepreneur, who tabled a 125p-a-share proposal in January. De La Rue's directors have been exploring options in recent months to maximise value for long-suffering shareholders, including a standalone sale of the currency-printing business or other proposals to acquire the entire company. The group's balance sheet has been under strain for years, with doubts at one point about whether it could stave off insolvency. After being beset by a series of corporate mishaps, including a string of profit warnings, a public row with its auditor and challenges in its operations in countries including India and Kenya, it was forced to seek breathing space from pension trustees by deferring tens of millions of pounds of payments into its retirement scheme. Soon after that, the company parachuted in Clive Whiley, a seasoned corporate troubleshooter, as chairman, with a mandate to repair its battered finances. Since then, its stock has recovered strongly, and is up 37% over the last year. De La Rue traces its roots back to 1813, when Thomas De La Rue established a printing business. Eight years later, he began producing straw hats and then moved into printing stationery, according to an official history of the company. Its first paper money was produced for the government of Mauritius in 1860, and in 1914 it began printing 10-shilling notes for the UK government on the outbreak of the First World War. De la Rue has been contacted for comment, while Atlas Holdings could not be reached for comment on Monday evening."

        "Content": "\n          City editor\n              @MarkKleinmanSky\n A payments company backed by Nick Candy, the Reform UK treasurer, will this week announce a tie-up with a London-based peer amid a rapidly shifting industry landscape. Sky News has learnt that VibePay, in which Candy Ventures is the largest shareholder, has agreed a deal to sell itself to Banked, a so-called 'pay by bank' platform. The all-share deal, which is expected to be announced on Tuesday, will see Mr Candy's investment vehicle holding a stake of roughly 25% in the combined group, according to insiders. One source said the deal would value the enlarged company at in excess of $100m. As part of the transaction, the VibePay founder, Luke Massie, and Candy Ventures director Steven Smith will join the board of Banked. VibePay specialises in 'conversational commerce', providing personalised offers and peer-to-peer payments to its users, connecting them to brands, sellers and banks. People close to the deal said that the takeover would help address a market opportunity by rewarding debit customers who have been overlooked by credit card operators, with debit card payments making up nearly 90% of all UK card payments but representing just a tiny fraction of payment rewards. Banked counts global financial giants including Bank of America, Citi, FIS and NAB among its strategic investors and partners. It has previously raised more than $60m in funding, while VibePay has raised over $10m from its backers. The deal is understood to be awaiting approval from the City regulator. In response to an enquiry from Sky News, Mr Candy said: \"I've been a strong supporter of VibePay, and I'm excited about the future with Banked. \"The global vision of the Banked founders is truly inspiring, and I see immense potential in the combined vision for the next generation of payments. \"This is a positive moment for the UK technology sector, with two British companies coming together to drive forward a global ambition. \"I'm proud to be a part of this journey and am eager to champion this story both in the UK and internationally.\" Mr Massie added: \"We've spent years building technology that genuinely connects people - not just for transactions, but for experiences. \"By joining forces with Banked, we now have the infrastructure, global reach, and merchant access to supercharge what we've built, and deliver real value to consumers at scale.\" Read more from Sky News:China issues first statement after UK takes over British SteelVirtual coaching platform has right Mindset for multimillion-pound fundraising Banked bought Waave, an Australian pay-by-bank provider, last October, strengthening its international presence, while it has a partnership with NAB - one of Australia's biggest lenders - to offer a service to Amazon customers in the country. \"The real value in Pay by Bank goes beyond cheap and secure payments; it's in making spending work for everyone,\" said Brad Goodall, Banked's chief executive. \"The combination of Banked and VibePay will drive Pay by Bank adoption through innovative consumer incentives - on par with credit cards - and empower merchants with deep data insights to drive acquisition and retention like never before. The companies declined to comment formally on the value of the acquisition or the valuation of the combined entity."

        "Content": "\n          City editor\n              @MarkKleinmanSky\n An AI start-up which helps businesses turn their expertise into an interactive digital coach is raising millions of pounds to help it expand into the US. Sky News understands that Mindset AI, which describes itself as an embedded AI agent platform, has secured £4.3m in a funding round jointly led by Edge VC and Pembroke VCT. Existing investors also participated in the raise, which will be announced later this week. The round takes the total sum raised by Mindset AI to just over £8m. The business was founded in 2019 by the executive team - including CEO Barrie Hadfield - that previously built and exited Workshare, a secure file-sharing software service. Mindset AI says it allows companies to create user-friendly AI agents which chat using natural language - and claims one of its clients has seen course enrolments increase tenfold within three weeks of launching a search and recommendation agent. Some forecasts suggest that the AI agent market is likely to grow from $5.1bn in revenue in 2024 to $47.1bn by 2030 - a compound annual growth rate of 44.8%. Mindset AI's new financial backing will support the development of its natural language programming interface and fund the opening of an office in Chicago. \"As AI evolves, so does the gap between businesses adopting it and those being left behind,\" Mr Hadfield said. \"AI talent is in short supply, and costs are high. \"Companies need solutions that let them deploy AI agents without heavy investment in AI teams or long development cycles.\" The company says its AI agents are now deployed in more than 2,700 companies as learning tutors, HR service delivery agents, and to facilitate customer support activities. \"Mindset AI is redefining how learning and development businesses present and monetise their content through AI-powered conversational agents.\" Fred Ursell, investment director of Pembroke Investment Managers, said. Mountside Ventures advised Mindset AI on the round."

        "Headline": "There had been concern that the coking coal and iron ore needed to keep the blast furnaces running may not have arrived before they started to cool down - after which it becomes extremely difficult to start them up again.",
        "Content": "The raw materials needed to keep the blast furnaces running at British Steel's Scunthorpe plant will be delivered to the site today, the government has confirmed. Ministers have been racing against time to secure the coking coal and iron ore needed to keep the furnaces at the UK's last virgin steel-producing plant operating. If they cool down too much, the molten iron solidifies and blocks the furnaces, making it extremely difficult and expensive to restart them. Jonathan Reynolds, the business secretary, will visit the port in nearby Immingham as the supplies from two ships are unloaded and transported to the plant. The Department for Business and Trade (DBT) said the materials had been provided by the US and would be enough to keep the furnaces running for weeks, while a third ship with coking coal and iron ore is on its way from Australia after a legal dispute between British Steel and the site's Chinese owner Jingye was resolved. The future of the British Steel plant at Scunthorpe had been hanging in the balance after Jingye decided to cancel future orders for the iron ore, coal and other raw materials needed to keep the furnaces running at the beginning of April. After talks with the owner broke down, the government summoned MPs who had been away from Westminster for the Easter recess back to parliament to pass an emergency bill on Saturday to take over the facility. The bill has brought the steelworks into effective government control, with the next step expected to be nationalisation. Mr Reynolds said: \"Thanks to the work of those at British Steel, and in my department, we have moved decisively to secure the raw materials we need to help save British Steel. \"Our industries depend on UK steel and - thanks to our plan for change - demand is set to shoot up: helping build the 1.5 million homes, railways, schools and hospitals we need to usher in a decade of national renewal.\"  Jingye's decision to cancel future orders of the raw materials needed to keep the furnaces running has led some to question whether the company might have purposefully attempted to shut the blast furnaces down. While Downing Street said it was not aware of \"sabotage\" at the plant, it did acknowledge that it had become \"clear\" the Chinese owners \"wanted to shut the blast furnaces\" during talks. Mr Reynolds said \"it might not be sabotage, it might be neglect\", while Ms Rayner said there was \"no evidence\" of corporate sabotage. However, the episode has sparked a debate about Chinese involvement in UK industries, with Mr Reynolds saying on Sunday that he \"wouldn't personally bring a Chinese company into our steel sector\". The Chinese company stepped in with a deal to buy British Steel's Scunthorpe plant out of insolvency five years ago. Commenting on the situation for the first time on Monday, a Chinese embassy spokesperson urged the British government not to \"politicise\" the row by \"linking it to security issues\", and to act with \"fairness, impartiality and non-discrimination... to make sure the legitimate rights and interests of the Chinese company be protected\". Read more:Why has the government rescued British SteelMP denied entry to Hong Kong speaks of her 'chilling' treatment \"It is an objective fact that British steel companies have generally encountered difficulties in recent years,\" it added. UK ministers have faced questions themselves over why they have only just acted on British Steel, given the fact that unions warned earlier this month that Jingye had decided to cancel future orders for the vital raw materials. The Conservatives accused the government of acting \"too late\" and implementing a \"botched nationalisation\" after ignoring warnings about the risk to the steelworks. Under the new legislation passed at the weekend, ministers now have the power to instruct British Steel to keep the plant in Scunthorpe open, order materials for steelmaking and instruct that workers be paid. It also authorises a jail sentence of up to two years for anyone who breaches this law."

The 15, also including a current Welsh Senedd member and a former police officer, have been charged with cheating related to bets placed on the timing of the 2024 general election. They are due to appear at Westminster Magistrates' Court at 10am this Friday to face the charges. Politics latest: China makes first statement after UK takes control of British Steel The Gambling Commission said its investigation, which began in June last year, \"focused on individuals suspected of using confidential information - specifically advance knowledge of the proposed election date - to gain an unfair advantage in betting markets\". It opened the investigation after former Montgomeryshire MP Craig Williams, Mr Sunak's former parliamentary private secretary, admitted placing a £100 bet on 19 May 2024 that the election would be in July. Mr Sunak announced the general election would be on 4 July, three days after Williams, who was also an election candidate, placed the bet. Williams, who was dropped as a candidate, admitted last June to placing a \"flutter\" on the election and said he \"committed a serious error of judgement, not an offence\". Current Senedd member, police officer and Tory campaign director charged Among those charged is Russell George, a Conservative member of the Welsh Senedd, who returned to the front bench in October after stepping back from his role as spokesman for mid-Wales in June. Over the weekend, the Welsh Conservatives re-selected him to be a candidate in the Senedd elections next year, but have now suspended him pending the \"outcome of the justice process\". Other notable people charged are former police officer Jeremy Hunt; Tony Lee, the Conservatives' former campaign director; his wife, Laura Saunders, a former Tory election candidate, as well as Nick Mason, the Conservatives' former chief data officer. All the others are, or were, also Conservative Party staff or candidates. The party has said those still working for them have been suspended. A Conservative Party spokesman said: \"The Conservative Party believes that those working in politics must act with integrity. Current members of staff who have been charged are being suspended with immediate effect. \"These incidents took place in May last year. Our party is now under new leadership and we are cooperating fully with the Gambling Commission to ensure that their investigation can conclude swiftly and transparently.\" Who are the 15 people charged? • Simon Chatfield, 51, from Farnham (former Conservative Party chief marketing officer)• Russell George, 50, from Newtown, Wales (suspended Welsh Conservative Senedd member for Montgomeryshire)• Amy Hind, 34, from Loughton, Essex• Anthony Hind, 36, from Loughton, Essex (former Conservative Party deputy digital director)• Jeremy Hunt, 55, from Horley (a former police officer, not the ex-chancellor)• Thomas James, 38, from Brecon, Wales (director of Welsh Conservatives)• Charlotte Lang, 36, from Brixton (former 2019 Conservative Aberavon candidate, current partner at Hanbury Strategy consultants)• Anthony Lee, 47, Bristol (known as Tony, former director of Conservative Party campaigning)• Iain Makepeace, 47, from Newcastle Upon Tyne (former Conservative Party head of creative, design and print)• Nick Mason, 51, from Gillingham (former Conservative Party chief data officer)• Paul Place, 53, from Hammersmith, London (trustee of The Conservative and Unionist Agents' Benevolent Association)• Laura Saunders, 37, from Bristol (Tony Lee's wife and Conservative 2024 candidate for Bristol North West who was then dropped)• James Ward, 40, from east London• Craig Williams, 39, from Llanfair Caereinion, Welshpool (former Montgomeryshire MP and Sunak aide)• Jacob Willmer, 39, from Richmond, London (partner at government advisory group Consulum and former special adviser to Greg Clarke when he was business secretary and communities and local government secretary). Labour candidate Kevin Craig was included in the investigation after placing a bet that he would lose his bid to become an MP, but was cleared of any wrongdoing in December. Ellie Reeves, chair of the Labour Party, said: \"This is a very serious development. The British people will expect that anyone found guilty of wrongdoing faces the full force of the law. \"Kemi Badenoch must make crystal clear that anyone found guilty of using insider information to cheat the system to try to enrich themselves has no place in the Conservative Party. No ifs, no buts. \"Labour is turning the page on 14 years of Conservative chaos and scandal and we're turning our country round through our Plan for Change. Only Labour can be trusted to deliver security for working people and the renewal Britain needs.\" Met Police investigation After the Gambling Commission began its investigation last June, the Metropolitan Police opened an inquiry into whether anyone had committed misconduct in public office. In August 2024, the Met said it would not be charging anyone, but several politicians and police officers remained under investigation by the Gambling Commission into whether they had broken criminal gambling laws."

        "Content": "\n          Political reporter\n              @fayebrownSky\n  Former minister Tulip Siddiq has said there is \"no evidence\" she has done anything wrong after Bangladesh issued a warrant for her arrest. Ms Siddiq told reporters outside her home that she is the \"victim of a politically motivated smear campaign\". Politics live: China issues first statement after UK takes control of British Steel Bangladesh's Anti-Corruption Commission (ACC) sought the warrant over allegations Ms Siddiq received a 7,200sq ft plot of land in the country's capital, Dhaka. Ms Siddiq's lawyers on Sunday told Sky News the allegations are \"completely false\", adding there was \"no basis at all for any charges to be made against her\". On Monday, Ms Siddiq said no one from the Bangladeshi authorities has contacted her and said she was facing a \"trial by media\". \"I can't dignify this politically motivated smear campaign with any comment,\" she said, alleging authorities are \"trying to harass me\". \n                  Politics latest: Nationalising British Steel could cost billions a day, former business secretary warns\n                 \n                  Race against time to keep Scunthorpe steel furnaces alive as raw materials to be delivered today\n                 \n                  From Shanghai to Scunthorpe - what's China's influence on UK industry?  \n                 There is \"no evidence I've done anything wrong\", she added. Ms Siddiq is the niece of Bangladesh's former prime minister Sheikh Hasina, who was deposed last summer following an uprising against her 20-year leadership. The Labour MP resigned as a Treasury minister earlier this year following an investigation by the prime minister's ethics adviser into her links to her aunt's Awami League administration, which is facing corruption allegations in Bangladesh. Ms Siddiq was not found to have breached the ministerial code. However, the prime minister's ethics adviser Sir Laurie Magnus said it was \"regrettable\" she was not more \"alert to the potential reputational risks\" arising from her close family's association with Bangladesh. At the time, Sir Keir Starmer praised Ms Siddiq for making the \"difficult decision\" to resign and said \"the door remains open for you\" going forward. Asked if there could be a way back for her following the latest developments, the prime minister's official spokesman today said: \"We don’t comment on individual legal cases.\"  Ms Siddiq has been an MP since 2015 and is probably best known for campaigning for the release of her constituent Nazanin Zaghari Ratcliffe, who was detained in Iran for six years. She came under pressure over her links to her aunt at the beginning of the year but has consistently denied wrongdoing. Ms Siddiq has also faced questions over properties in London she has lived in or lives in which are allegedly linked to her aunt's allies. A Conservative Party spokesman said Ms Siddiq \"should immediately stand down as a Labour MP\" if she is the subject of an arrest warrant in Bangladesh."

Scotland's first minister partially lifted the salary freeze - which was introduced by former SNP leader Alex Salmond in 2009 - to coincide with the start of the new tax year. All ministers will receive £19,126 extra from this month, taking the salary of a cabinet secretary to £116,125 and a junior minister to £100,575. It comes as many Scots are being forced to tighten their belts amid surging household bills, including council tax rises of up to 15.6%. Mr Swinney denied he made the decision to partially lift the pay freeze in a bid to entice SNP MPs from Westminster to Holyrood. It comes as many prominent MSPs have announced they plan to step down ahead of the Scottish parliament elections in 2026.

The first minister said the 16-year freeze was \"necessary\", adding: \"But I've applied the principle of fairness that I think all members of the Scottish parliament should be able to take the salary to which they are entitled. \"I've reflected on my own position as the decision-maker and I've decided that, so that people don't think that I've taken a decision from which I benefit personally, that I'll leave my salary - MSP and ministerial - frozen, so there's no sense that I'm benefiting from decisions that I believe is fair to take for others.\" MSP Craig Hoy, the Scottish Conservatives' shadow finance secretary, branded the SNP's performance in office as \"uniformly dismal\". He added: \"Nationalist politicians have made a mess of everything they touch - our NHS, education, housing, policing and transport - while stifling the economy, pushing through savage cuts and making Scotland the highest-taxed part of the UK.\" John O'Connell, chief executive of TaxPayers' Alliance, said \"Scots will be absolutely seething\". He added: \"The public realm is in a miserable state in Scotland, with politicians abjectly failing to deliver on voters' priorities, while also hammering taxpayers with some of the highest bills in the UK. \"If these ministers had any shame they'd be abandoning this pay rise and would not consider another one until they've delivered a boost in living standards, measured by GDP per capita.\" Read more from Sky News:What next for British Steel?Rise in suicide attempts linked to HMRC tax crackdown During the media conference, Mr Swinney also announced the Scottish government's legislative programme will be published earlier than usual on 6 May to allow for a \"full year of delivery\" ahead of the 2026 elections. He said the legislative programme would make it easier to get appointments with GPs, adding that a \"corner has been turned\" on NHS performance. Mr Swinney said: \"I know people are tired and anxious, desperate for light at the end of the tunnel, and that's why I want us to be prepared rather than simply scared. \"Advice and activity in the face of this latest challenge, rather than just anxious. And it's why I want us to be united and creative in our response, to ensure that we are as resilient as we possibly can be. \"You can put tariffs on many things, but you can't put them on ingenuity and common purpose. \"The programme for government will be laser-focused on delivery. It will set out what I believe my government can and will deliver for the people in Scotland over the coming year.\" Mr Swinney said he had spoken to Prime Minister Keir Starmer and other devolved leaders on Friday about US President Donald Trump's tariffs. He said while the call had been constructive, the UK government should do \"much more to protect Scotland's economic interests\". Mr Swinney said he will convene a meeting of business leaders and trade unions this week to discuss how to respond to the \"emerging economic realities\". The first minister also stated that the Grangemouth oil refinery should be nationalised by the UK government in light of action taken at the British Steel site at Scunthorpe. He urged Chancellor Rachel Reeves to relax her fiscal rules, adding: \"If British Steel is to be nationalised to protect it, then so too should Grangemouth\"."

        "Content": "\n          Climate reporter\n              @SeabrookClimate\n 'Tropical nights' might sound like a beach-side party, or a refreshing cocktail, but the reality is less entertaining. In fact, tropical nights - when temperatures don't dip below 20C - have become an increasingly common, sweaty fixture in Europe since the 1980s, and it's disrupting both lives and holidays in unexpected ways. Last year, southern European summer destinations - including the sun-drenched shores of southern Italy, Croatia, Turkey and Greece - sweltered through a record-breaking 23 tropical nights, according to new data. That's nearly three times the average of just eight, and far above the previous record of 16 in 2012, the EU's Copernicus Climate Change Service said. Tropical nights mean a sleepless, sticky time in bed, when sweaty sheets cling to skin and opening windows brings no respite. Dann Mitchell from the UK's Met Office said nighttime temperatures are \"really important for our health\" because it's the part of each day when we recover. And if it can't do that, it brings a \"whole host of issues\", he warned. These sweltering figures came in what was the hottest year ever in Europe. But they aren't a one-off. Climate change is making the atmosphere warmer, bringing 'heat stress' in the day as well as at night. \n                  The good, the bad and the ugly in Donald Trump's coal plans\n                 \n                  March hottest on record in Europe - with warnings of 'harsher heat waves and wildfires' this summer\n                 \n                  Luton Airport expansion plans approved by transport secretary\n                 Last year there were also 66 days of 'strong heat stress' across southern Europe - when daily temperatures reach a 'feels-like' temperature of 32°C or higher - far surpassing the average of 29 days. The price of sleepless nights Soaring daytime highs paired with sultry nights are pushing the limits of human comfort - and health. Madeleine Thomson, Head of Climate Impacts & Adaptation at health research foundation Wellcome, said: \"Europe is heating up, and we're not prepared for the toll this will take on our health.\" \"Deaths from heat stress are the most visible impact. But extreme heat doesn't just kill - it also increases the risk of heart disease, pregnancy complications, and poor mental health.\" In Britain's scorching summer of 2022, an extra 2,800 people aged over 65 are estimated to have died from heat-related reasons. Children are especially vulnerable because they are small and so warm up faster. Pregnant women, whose bodies already struggle with temperature regulation, are also at risk. While air conditioning \"helps us to survive\", it is energy intensive, increasingly unaffordable, and can lead to power blackouts when the system is overloaded, said Ilan Kelman, professor of disasters and health from Reading University. Earth, wine and fire But it's not just tourists who are feeling the heat. \"The economic consequences are profound,\" said Dr Hannah Cloke, a hydrologist at Reading University, including for farmers grappling with withering crops and crusty soils. Wine harvests were down last year, variously described by the industry as \"dismal\" and \"horrible\". Meanwhile while olive trees were parched by heat and drought, pavements in Italy melted, and a fire near Athens burned almost 11,000 hectares (110 km2). Holiday company Intrepid Travel said it has \"definitely seen an increase in the severity and frequency of extreme weather events impacting our trips in Europe\". It is adapting to this \"new reality\" by scrapping hiking holidays in Turkey in July and August and running new summer trips to Scandinavia - with bookings from Brits up 40% last year. Google told Sky News it had detected a new, rapidly growing trend for searches like \"summer holiday in Europe not too hot\" and \"what summer holiday destinations do not have risk of wildfires in July\". A hotter future The record-breaking summer of 2024 may have been extreme, but it's part of a long term shift, said Copernicus. Europe is the fastest-warming continent, warming twice as fast as the global average - partly due to its overlap with the Arctic. The weather still varies wildly, so scientists can't predict the exact number of tropical nights or heat waves this year, but they are confident in the trend. Madeleine Thomson, head of climate impacts at Wellcome, said: \"We urgently need to cut emissions and adapt our cities. Simple changes, like adding green spaces and waterways, can help cool urban areas and protect public health.\""

Weightlessness The crew were weightless for just four minutes after passing the Karman line, a 62-mile-high boundary that is internationally recognised as the boundary of space. They could be heard screaming as they began to feel weightless, and told each other to look at the incredible views of the moon. As the crew were leaving space, Perry started to sing What a Wonderful World by Louis Armstrong.

Satellite data shows 2025 is already the second worst year on record by area burned and number of fires. It also reveals that in the last week there have been more blazes in the country compared with other parts of Europe experiencing similar weather conditions. As of Monday, there have been 115 blazes and an area of more than 95 square miles (24,890 hectares) - nearly the size of Edinburgh - has been scorched since 1 January, according to European Forest Fire Information System figures. Only 2019 was worse for area burned (28,754 hectares) and 2022 for the number of fires (151). The data shows the UK has seen more fires from January to April, compared with the same period in 2024, and is higher than expected for the time of year. The Met Office said the fires are due to dry and breezy conditions in spring which came after a damp winter, meaning there was \"fuel\" for the blazes because of plant growth. Further dry conditions could make 2025 the worst year for wildfires, it said.  The National Fire Chiefs Council (NFCC) said fire and rescue services in England and Wales have responded to 411 wildfires so far this year - more than double the number for the same period in 2022 (189). The NFCC said responding to wildfires \"requires a lot of resource\" which puts more pressure on other service activities. \"These figures paint a concerning picture about the growing incident rate of wildfires in the UK,\" a spokesman said.

        "Content": "Sean \"Diddy\" Combs has pleaded not guilty to additional charges of sex trafficking and transportation to engage in prostitution, which were added to the indictment against him earlier in April. The new allegations take the total number of criminal charges against the rap mogul to five - following the three original counts, which also included racketeering conspiracy, filed in September. Combs, 55, has already pleaded not guilty to the original charges and strenuously denied all allegations against him. He appeared in court on Monday to enter his additional plea before US District Judge Arun Subramanian in Manhattan, New York. Combs, with grey hair and a goatee, and wearing tan prison clothing over a white thermal shirt, was more subdued than in previous hearings. Today's hearing also saw Combs' lawyers suggest they may request a two-week adjournment for his trial, scheduled for May, if they do not receive certain critical evidence from prosecutors. Combs' lawyer, Teny Geragos, said the defence had not been sent some 200,000 emails between the rapper and one of the alleged victims. Assistant US attorney Christie Slavik said prosecutors oppose any delay and accused Combs' lawyers of using \"gamesmanship\" to delay the trial. Judge Subramanian admonished the defence, saying: \"We are on a freight train speeding towards trial, if you want an adjournment, you need to make that application within the next forty-eight hours.\" Both sides will be back in court for another hearing on Friday. Addressing the additional charges in a statement, lawyers for Combs previously said: \"These are not new allegations or new accusers. These are the same individuals... who were involved in consensual relationships.\" Prosecutors claim the rapper and producer used his business empire to sexually abuse women between 2004 and 2024. He has been accused of organising \"freak offs\" - allegedly inducing women and male sex workers into drug-fuelled sexual performances. Combs has denied allegations of wrongdoing, saying all relationships and sexual encounters were consensual. His trial is due to start on 5 May, with jury selection expected to take about a week before the opening statements, which are scheduled to begin on 12 May.

He also faces dozens of civil lawsuits by women and men who have accused him of sexual abuse."

        "Content": "\n          Science and Technology reporter\n        Katy Perry has blasted off to space along with five other women in the first all-female space crew in over sixty years.  The Firework singer lifted off from West Texas on a Blue Origin rocket before becoming the first artist to sing in space. Flying alongside Perry were author Lauren Sanchez, the fiancee of Blue Origin owner and Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, journalist and TV presenter Gayle King, civil rights activist Amanda Nguyen, former rocket scientist Aisha Bowe, and filmmaker Kerianne Flynn.  The star-studded crew were supported on the ground by family and friends including Kris Jenner, Khloe Kardashian and Oprah Winfrey, who said she had \"never been more proud\" of her friend, King. \"There's only one time all the women are going up for the first time,\" Oprah said she told her friend when urging her to go on the flight, telling her she'd regret turning down the opportunity. Weightlessness The crew were weightless for just four minutes after passing the Karman line, a 62-mile-high boundary that is internationally recognised as the boundary of space. They could be heard screaming as they began to feel weightless, and told each other to look at the incredible views of the moon. As the crew were leaving space, Perry started to sing What a Wonderful World by Louis Armstrong.  Asked why she chose that song, she said: \"It's not about me or about me singing my songs, it was about a collective energy in there. \"It's about this wonderful world that we see right out there and appreciating it.\"  She confirmed she will be writing a song about the experience.

They launched in a rocket called New Shepard, rising to 65 miles above the Earth, where they unbuckled and floated. Back on planet Earth there was a star-studded gathering.

The descent Three parachutes on their capsule opened up to bring them safely back down to Earth and just before they landed, an air cushion blew a cloud of dust up in the west Texas desert, giving a dramatic-looking touchdown. \"Excited as I am, I'll be very glad when we come back down,\" said self-confessed nervous flier King before liftoff. When she exited the shuttle, the presenter kissed the floor and said: \"Thank you, Jesus\". She said it was \"oddly quiet\" in space, and it reminded her that people needed to \"do better and be better\" on Earth.

        "Content": "Actress Samantha Davis, the wife of Warwick Davis, died after suffering a cardiac arrest hours before she was due to be discharged from hospital, an inquest has found.  Mrs Davis, 53, died at London's University College Hospital on 24 March last year. She had been admitted six and a half weeks earlier, after a disc prolapse caused a sudden loss of mobility in her lower limbs. She then underwent a thoracotomy operation - a surgical procedure where the chest wall is opened - on 20 February. Following a second thoracotomy on 14 March, Mrs Davis's condition improved and the hospital was planning to discharge her, the inquest at Inner West London Coroner's Court heard. However, she went into cardiac arrest at 11.25pm on 23 March, and was pronounced dead at 0.28am on 24 March, after a failed attempt to resuscitate her. Senior coroner Professor Fiona Wilcox said she was satisfied the cause of death \"should be arrhythmic cardiac arrest and complications following left thoracotomies\". Mrs Davis had achondroplasia, a bone growth disorder which results in dwarfism, \"complicated by very severe spinal problems\" requiring multiple surgeries from 2016, the coroner added. The hospital delivered \"nothing but excellent care\" and all of Mrs Davis's \"complications were appropriately managed\", Prof Wilcox said. \"It is frankly heartbreaking that the surgery itself was successful only for complications to arise and to cause her death,\" she added. David Lawrence, a cardiothoracic surgeon at University College London Hospitals, said Mrs Davis's condition had been \"progressing well\". During her hospital stay, she had two surgical chest drains removed - the second on the day she suffered the cardiac arrest, he said. \"Very sadly, on the night this happened, the original plan had been that she would be discharged home the following day,\" he told the inquest. \"We had good evidence that this patient had a chest x-ray that was acceptable, very stable observations and this patient did not bleed during the day.\" Read more:Katy Perry sings in spaceWhite Lotus star hits out at 'mean' joke Mr Davis, known for his film roles in the Star Wars and Harry Potter series, dedicated his BAFTA film fellowship award to Mrs Davis during an emotional tribute at the ceremony in February.

        "Content": "\n          Arts and entertainment reporter\n              @BethanyMinelle\n The White Lotus star Aimee Lou Wood has called a sketch making fun of her teeth \"mean and unfunny\". The 31-year-old British actress posted an Instagram story about the joke on US TV show Saturday Night Live (SNL), in which comedian Sarah Sherman used exaggerated prosthetic teeth to do an impression of her. In the skit, titled The White Potus, Donald Trump and his family were reimagined as The White Lotus's Ratliff family, dealing with the backlash to the US president's recently introduced tariffs. The third season of Mike White's hit hotel drama has just concluded on Sky Atlantic. While the other characters in the skit were shown in the guise of real-life political figures, Wood, who plays Chelsea in the show, was shown in character talking about a monkey. Wood, who shot to fame on Netflix's Sex Education, said she was the only character in the piece that was \"punched down on\". She also said a part of the parody that joked about fluoride, following recent debates in the US as to if it should be removed from the tap water, was missing the point as she has \"big gap teeth not bad teeth\". Wood wrote: \"Yes, take the piss for sure - that's what the show is about - but there must be a cleverer, more nuanced, less cheap way?\" The Stockport-born star also flagged Sherman's poor attempt at a Mancunian accent. But Wood went on to say that she wasn't \"hating\" on Sherman personally, just \"on the concept\". Wood also flagged an online comment that said: \"It was a sharp and funny skit until it suddenly took a screeching turn into 1970s misogyny,\" adding, \"This sums up my view\". After sharing her opinions, Wood said she had received \"thousands of messages in agreement\" and so was \"glad I said something\". Read more from Sky News:Will Katy Perry sing in space?Upstairs, Downstairs actress dies  Wood shared comments of support she had received. One, from an unnamed fan, said she too had \"a big gap\" in her teeth, as well as \"an overbite\" and that while she had been previously considering \"spending thousands on fixing it,\" seeing Wood look \"gorgeous\" on The White Lotus had made her reconsider. Wood said SNL has since apologised to her. Wood previously said, during an appearance on The Jonathan Ross Show, that the positive reception to her performance was \"a real full-circle moment after being bullied for my teeth forever\". NBC, which airs SNL, has been contacted for comment."
