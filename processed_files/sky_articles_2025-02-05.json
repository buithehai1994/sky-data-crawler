        "Content": " The White House has appeared to backtrack on Donald Trump's assertion that Palestinians should be permanently resettled from Gaza - as a former Israeli PM told Sky News he was \"deeply doubtful\" about the plan. On Tuesday, during a visit of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Mr Trump said: \"If we can get a beautiful area to resettle people, permanently, in nice homes where they can be happy and not be shot and not be killed and not be knifed to death like what's happening in Gaza.\" He drew global condemnation for his comments, which included: \"The US will take over the Gaza Strip and we will do a job with it too. We'll own it.\" When questioned, Mr Trump said he did envision a \"long-term ownership position\" and described Gaza's future as \"the Riviera of the Middle East\".   What you need to know about Trump's Gaza planFollow live: Trump latest But speaking on Wednesday, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt appeared to contradict Mr Trump's words and claimed he had said it would always be temporary. \"The president has made it clear that they need to be temporarily relocated out of Gaza for the rebuilding of this effort,\" she said to reporters. She continued: \"Again, it's a demolition site right now. It's not a liveable place for any human being. And I think it's actually quite evil to suggest that people should live in such dire conditions.\" Ms Leavitt also added that Mr Trump \"has not committed\" to sending troops to Gaza - but she did not rule it out. 'A massive row back' Sky News US correspondent Mark Stone was at the news conference where Ms Leavitt spoke. He said: \"I think what we heard there, reading between the lines, was a massive row back. \"She said that the relocation of Palestinians from Gaza while the territory is rebuilt would be temporary, and she said the president was 'very clear' about that. \"Well he wasn't very clear about that. He was very clear that it would be permanent. Indeed, he repeated this idea that they would be permanently relocated to 'somewhere beautiful', he said on many occasions yesterday. \"And so while she didn't acknowledge that there was a shift in position between yesterday and today, it was implicit in everything that she said.\" 'Deeply doubtful' Ex-Israeli prime minister Ehud Barak told Sky News he was \"deeply doubtful\" about the practicality of the plan.  He said: \"I cannot judge it, there are many in Israel who are really excited about it but it seems to me deeply doubtful whether it can ever fly. \"It's probably deliberately or subconsciously used as a leverage upon the Arab leaders to shake them up and to start to think about how they can contribute to avoid the need for America to intervene. I think that's more probable an explanation for the whole story.\" Read more:Trump's Gaza plan might be part of something biggerStarmer contradicts Trump on Middle EastGaza solution betrays Trump's ignorance of history ðŸ‘‰ Listen to Sky News Daily on your podcast app ðŸ‘ˆ It was not clear whether Mr Trump was serious with his proposal or simply taking an extreme position as a bargaining strategy, as he has done in the past. While Mr Trump's comments have thrust the politics and future of Gaza into the headlines, on the ground, nearly 16 months of Israeli bombardment has devastated the coastal enclave and killed more than 47,000 people, according to its Hamas-run health ministry. The offensive followed the 7 October Hamas attacks in 2023, in which around 1,200 people were killed in southern Israel and about 250 people were taken hostage."

        "Content": " Donald Trump's announcement that he wants to \"develop\" Gaza and turn it into the \"Riviera of the Middle East\" has been described as \"absurd\" and \"entirely unrealistic\". During a joint news conference with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu late on Tuesday, Mr Trump proposed that the two million people living in Gaza could be moved to Jordan, Egypt - and beyond. Gazans hit back at Trump's plan; US latest While it is not clear how Gaza will be rebuilt when the current conflict between Hamas and Israel ends - it is equally uncertain how the US would come to \"own\" Gaza, resettle its population, and redevelop the land. What did Trump say about the Gaza Strip? Mr Trump described Gaza as a \"demolition site\" where \"virtually every building is down\". Laying out his idea of what would happen beyond an Israel-Hamas ceasefire, he proposed: \"The US will take over the Gaza Strip and we will do a job with it too.\" He said America would be \"responsible for dismantling all of the dangerous unexploded bombs and other weapons on the site\", before it would \"get rid of the destroyed buildings\", and \"level it out\". He envisioned an \"economic development\", which he described as the \"Riveria of the Middle East\" - that would create thousands and thousands of jobs\". \"Everybody I've spoken to loves the idea of the United States owning that piece of land, developing and creating thousands of jobs,\" he added. The White House has described the plan as \"out-of-the-box\" and \"visionary\". What about the population? Gaza's two million people would not return to their territory under Mr Trump's plans. Instead, he suggested building \"various domains\" for them to \"permanentlyâ€¦ live out their lives in peace and harmony instead of having to go back and do it again\". This could take the form of \"numerous sites\" or \"one large site\", he added. Read moreAnalysis: So outrageous it might be something biggerAnalysis: Plan betrays Trump's ignorance of history The only locations he mentioned by name were Jordan and Egypt, which he said, despite their leaders consistently refusing to resettle more Palestinian refugees, would \"give us the kind of land we need to get this done\". He described the new sites as a \"beautiful area to resettle people, permanently in nice homes, where they can be happy and not shotâ€¦ and killedâ€¦ like what's happening in Gaza\". He said \"neighbouring countries of great wealth\" could finance them - without stipulating to what extent this would involve the US. There were no details on whether the plans change the current US position of a two-state solution for the Israeli and Palestinian people. Who controls Gaza - and who has occupied it in the past? Gaza has been under the control of Hamas since 2007 - after it dominated the 2006 elections and subsequent violent clashes with fellow Palestinian group Fatah. The area made up of Gaza, Israel, and the West Bank has a long and complicated history - with both Israel and Palestinians laying claim to various parts of it. In 1917, the British took control of what was then known as Palestine from the Ottoman Empire. Under the Balfour Declaration, they promised to create a Jewish homeland there. Jewish people then began migrating to the region in large numbers - accelerated by the threat of Nazism in Europe and the Second World War, which created tension with the Palestinian people already living there. When the United Nations was set up after the war in 1947, it proposed a partition plan - whereby roughly 45% of the land would belong to the Palestinian people and 55% to Jewish people. Jerusalem, which has particular sensitivities because of its religious significance to both sides, was proposed as a separate international territory. This plan was never actioned - and instead - the state of Israel was declared in 1948. The Arab-Israeli war that broke out immediately after the declaration saw 750,000 Palestinian people forced from their homes in what was known as the Nakba - or \"catastrophe\" in English. They were given refugee status by the UN and fled to neighbouring countries. The Palestinians retained control of two small areas - what we now know as Gaza and the West Bank. During the Six-Day War in 1967, Israel occupied Gaza, the West Bank, and East Jerusalem. They also took control of the Golan Heights, an area belonging to Syria. This saw hundreds of thousands more Palestinians forced from their homes. During his first presidency, Donald Trump recognised Israel's control of the Golan Heights. Different groups have fought for control of Gaza since then - including Hamas and the Palestinian Authority. There was hope for a two-state solution - one Israel and one Palestine - when their leaders signed the Oslo Accords committing to peace in the region within five years. This never materialised, however, and Gaza has become increasingly cut off from outside resources. The UN runs refugee camps for millions of displaced Palestinians - both inside Gaza and the West Bank - and in the neighbouring countries of Jordan, Lebanon, and Syria. Before the 2023 war broke out between Israel and Hamas, tensions were high among Palestinian communities as Israel continued to expand settlements in the West Bank and East Jerusalem. Trump Gaza plan 'absurd' and US has 'no authority' Egypt, Jordan, and Saudi Arabia, which as fellow Arab nations support the Palestinian cause, immediately rejected Mr Trump's ideas. They, along with Syria and Lebanon, are already struggling to support millions of displaced Palestinians. Hamas described the proposals as \"ridiculous and absurd\" in a statement from one of its officials Sami Abu Zuhri. The Palestinian Liberation Organisation reiterated its support for a two-state solution. Sky News Middle East correspondent Alistair Bunkall said the plans have left politicians and diplomats across the region \"speechless\". \"It's entirely unrealistic for so many reasons,\" he says.  Forcing Palestinians from Gaza would breach their right under international law to self-determination - and would constitute ethnic cleansing, he adds. It would also, according to the chair of the UK's Defence Select Committee, Conservative MP Tobias Ellwood, require \"a minimum of 50,000\" US troops in the region for several years. This would prove a \"massive logistical challenge\", as US military resources in other parts of the world have to be redirected there. It is also out of step with Mr Trump's previous indications he wants to scale back US involvement in the Middle East - and adopt a more protectionist foreign policy. Many Gazans have endured horrendous living conditions in the hope Gaza will be rebuilt as part of an independent Palestinian state. As such, most would not want to leave, Bunkall says, adding: \"Ask any Gazan and they will tell you it is their home, however hellish.\" The international community has been involved in the rebuilding of war-torn countries throughout the 20th and 21st centuries. In this sense, the US could be mandated as a \"reconstruction power\" in Gaza. However, in cases such as post-Second World War Germany or Japan - allies handed back the territory after rebuilding - not resettled their residents elsewhere."

        "Content": " Donald Trump has signed an executive order banning trans women athletes from competing in female sports. The move is designed to prevent people who were biologically assigned male at birth from participating in certain sporting events, including those at school. The order, titled \"Keeping Men Out of Women's Sports\", will call for \"immediate enforcement\" against schools and athletic associations that deny women single-sex sports and single-sex changing rooms. It also coincides with National Girls and Women in Sports Day and it marks another notable shift in the way the federal government treats transgender people under Mr Trump. Follow live: Donald Trump latest Ahead of signing the order, Mr Trump said: \"From now on women's sports will be only for women. \"We've gotten the woke lunacy out of our military and now we're getting it out of women's sports.\" \n                  Donald Trump is riffing off his inflammatory rhetoric by banning trans athletes competing in America\n                 \n                  White House suggests Palestinians won't be permanently resettled - as ex-Israeli PM casts doubt on Trump plan\n                 \n                  Trump tariff threat saw US imports hit record high\n                 Analysis: Trump is riffing off his inflammatory rhetoric by banning trans athletes competing in America He also spoke about the coming Olympics and World Cup which the US is hosting, and said he wouldn't allow any transgender athletes to compete. He went on: \"In Los Angeles in 2028, my administration will not stand by and watch men beat and batter female athletes. \"We're not going to let it happen. \"Just to make sure, I'm also directing our secretary of homeland security to deny any and all visa applications made by men attempting to fraudulently enter the US while identifying as women athletes to try and get into the games.\" In signing the order, surrounded by a number of women and girls, Mr Trump claimed \"the war on women's sports is over\". The order authorises the education department to penalise schools that allow transgender athletes to compete and any school found in violation could lose its federal funding. Despite their small numbers within America, transgender people have been the target of three orders signed by Mr Trump since coming into office, Sky News' US partner NBC News reported. These targeted participation in the military and access to gender-affirming care. On his very first day in office last month, Mr Trump passed one order that called on the federal government to only recognise two genders - male and female. During his campaign, he pledged to \"keep men out of women's sports\" and get rid of the \"transgender insanity\" but his office offered little in the way of details. Olivia Hunt, director of federal policy at Advocates for Trans Equality, told Sky News' Yalda Hakim that the order wasn't just about elite athletes but would impact young children and their development too. She said: \"We're basically taking those children and saying to them we don't think it's vital that you learn the same sets of skills that your peers develop [playing sports]. \"We are setting you aside, putting you apart, and saying you're different and it's okay for you to be set aside, treated differently, and bullied by your peers. \"Children should be protected. Children should be allowed to follow their interests, follow the sports they want to participate in and not have to worry that public officials will treat their existence as a cheap round of applause.\"  This is the latest in a flurry of executive orders the Republican president has enacted in his first days and weeks in office. Some of these have been blocked by judges, and it is not yet clear if this order will avoid such a fate. It will likely involve how the Trump administration interprets Title IX - a civil rights law that prevents sex-based discrimination in education programmes or activities that receive federal funding. Ahead of the signing, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said the order \"upholds the promise of Title IX\".

        "Content": "\n          Political reporter\n              @fayebrownSky\n Grenfell campaigners say they have been told by the deputy prime minister that the tower block will be demolished, accusing her of \"ignoring the voices of bereaved\". In a statement, Grenfell United claimed Angela Rayner had not given a reason behind her decision and refused to say how many of the victims' families and survivors had been consulted. Confirming a meeting with the housing secretary on Wednesday, it said: \"Angela Rayner could not give a reason for her decision to demolish the tower. \"She refused to confirm how many bereaved and survivors had been spoken to in the recent, short four-week consultation. \"But judging from the room alone - the vast majority of whom were bereaved - no one supported her decision. \"But she claims her decision is based on our views. \"Today's meeting showed just how upset bereaved and survivors are about not having their views heard or considered in this decision. \n                  Grenfell fire families sent letter about unidentified remains\n                 \n                  Cladding safety work needs target date to stop residents living with fear of fire, says government spending watchdog\n                 \n                  Housing minister Rushanara Ali loses brief after complaint by Grenfell survivors\n                 \"Ignoring the voices of bereaved on the future of our loved ones' gravesite is disgraceful and unforgivable.\" The government has previously said there will be no changes to the site before the eighth anniversary of the fire disaster, which claimed 72 lives  on 14 June 2017. It is expected more details will be set out by ministers by the end of the week. A spokesperson for Grenfell Next of Kin, a separate group representing some bereaved families, earlier told the PA news agency that the decision around the tower's future was \"obviously a very sensitive and difficult\" one. They added: \"For the next of kin of the deceased, that building is a shrine and the death place of their immediate families, their brothers, sisters, mothers, fathers, husbands, wives and children - but they understand the hard facts around safety.\" Engineering experts have said that while the tower remains stable, and it is safe for people to live, work and study near by, its condition will worsen over time and there is no realistic prospect of bringing it back into use. The latest advice issued to the government in September was that the building, or the part of it that was significantly damaged, should be taken down. What is left of the tower has stood in place since the tragedy, with a covering on the building featuring a large green heart accompanied by the words \"forever in our hearts\". Views have varied on what should happen to the site. Some of the bereaved and survivors feel the tower should remain in place until there are criminal prosecutions over the failings which led to the disaster. The final report of the Grenfell Tower Inquiry, published in September, concluded the fire was the result of \"decades of failure\" by government and the construction industry to act on the dangers of flammable materials on high-rise buildings. The west London tower block was covered in combustible products because of the \"systematic dishonesty\" of firms who made and sold the cladding and insulation, inquiry chairman Sir Martin Moore-Bick said. He said the \"simple truth\" is that all the deaths were avoidable and that those who lived in the tower were \"badly failed\" by authorities \"in most cases through incompetence but, in some cases, through dishonesty and greed\". However, the Metropolitan Police said last year that decisions on criminal charges for the Grenfell Tower blaze are not expected until the end of 2026. It would mean a near 10-year wait for justice if anyone is ultimately charged - a length described by families as \"unbearable\". The disaster was Britain's deadliest residential fire since the second world war and began a national reckoning over the safety and conditions of social housing and tower blocks.  Separately, the Grenfell Tower Memorial Commission has been consulting on plans for a permanent memorial in the area of the tower. A shortlist of five potential design teams was announced last month, with a winner expected to be selected this summer to enable a planning application to be submitted in late 2026. A government spokesperson said: \"The priority for the deputy prime minister is to meet with and write to the bereaved, survivors and the immediate community to let them know her decision on the future of the Grenfell Tower. \"This is a deeply personal matter for all those affected, and the deputy prime minister is committed to keeping their voice at the heart of this.\""

        "Content": "\n          Political reporter\n        Southport killer Axel Rudakubana's anti-terror case should have been kept open, a review into his attacks has found. Following the killings in Southport last summer, a rapid review was launched into Rudakubana's contact with Prevent - a government strategy aimed at stopping people from becoming terrorists. Speaking in the House of Commons, Home Office minister Dan Jarvis repeated that Rudakubana was in contact three times before his attacks at a Taylor Swift dance class where three young girls were murdered. Politics latest: Local elections delayed  He added that the report found Rudakubana should have been referred to Channel, another anti-terror scheme. Mr Jarvis said: \"The review concluded that too much focus was placed on the absence of a distinct ideology, to the detriment of considering the perpetrator's susceptibility, grievances, and complex needs. \"There was an under-exploration of the significance of his repeat referrals and the cumulative risk, including his history of violence. \"There were potentially incomplete lines of inquiry, that at the time the perpetrator could have fallen into a mixed, unclear or unstable category for Channel due to his potential interest in mass violence. \"Indeed, the overall conclusion of the review is that he should have been case-managed through the Channel multi-agency process, rather than closed to Prevent.\" He said the review found Rudakubana's referral to Prevent was \"closed prematurely\", and there was \"sufficient concern to keep the case active while further information was collected\".  The review noted Rudakubana was referred to Prevent on three occasions: first in December 2019 when he was 13, again in February 2021 when he was 14, and finally in April 2021. The first report was due to concerns he was carrying a knife and searching for school shootings online. The second was for online activity relating to Libya and Colonel Gaddafi, and the third for searching for London bombings, the IRA and the Israel-Palestine conflict. \"On each of these occasions, the decision at the time was that the perpetrator should not progress to the Channel multi-agency process,\" Mr Jarvis said. ðŸ‘‰ Listen to Sky News Daily on your podcast app ðŸ‘ˆ The report highlighted that in the second referral, Rudakubana's name was spelt differently from the first. It then says a Prevent supervisor was unable to find the previous referral and \"this may have caused the case to be closed quickly on minimal information\". As part of the review, 14 recommendations were made on how to improve Prevent, which Mr Jarvis said they had accepted and would be implementing. Mr Jarvis said the government was working to set up an inquiry into what happened as soon as possible, although confirmed it would not initially be on a statutory footing.

He said: \"It shows that part of the challenge was to try to work out did this guy have an ideology. The public might think that's a very specific point but the Prevent programme is based on counterterrorism. \"For terrorism, you need to have an ideology behind your act of violence. This report says they should have looked closer at that and should have perhaps termed it as an unclear or mixed ideology. \"The report also shows the challenges of the overlap with mental health and autism. The only positive thing is that there will be a public inquiry that will look into these issues in greater depth.\" He added: \"The report shows the complexity of trying to assess people and whether they are going to take their perverted ideas and issues into more serious violence. \"This is an absolute tragedy and I know the officers involved and the wider counter terrorism network will be really, really upset that this guy got through the net and they weren't able to prevent the horrific attack he carried out.\""

        "Content": "\n          Security and Defence Editor\n              @haynesdeborah\n It would be a \"major mistake\" to deploy British, French and other allied troops to guarantee Ukraine's security without involving the US, the Ukrainian president has told Sky News. Volodymyr Zelenskyy even said such a move would \"give Russia an advantage\", signalling that he did not believe a European-only option to deter future Russian aggression in the wake of any potential ceasefire deal with Moscow would be strong enough. The president also had a warning for London and other NATO member states to spend now on strengthening their militaries or risk finding themselves in Ukraine's position - at war and forced to invest its whole budget on defence. Mr Zelenskyy was speaking after a meeting in Kyiv with David Lammy, the UK foreign secretary.   As the two men sat down for their discussion, though, Sky News asked the Ukrainian leader whether ceasefire talks with Russia would need to start in the coming weeks. Speaking in English, Mr Zelenskyy said: \"First of all, we have to manage our meeting and our own plans with the US, Europe, European leaders, our partners. \"We have to have a common agenda between us, then share it even with the enemy. In any way step by step.\" One possible step that is being discussed by the UK, France and a number of other European allies is the potential deployment of an international force to Ukraine to provide security guarantees that Russia would not attack again following a peace deal. It is still only an idea but is increasingly being talked about. At the news conference following the meeting with Mr Lammy, Mr Zelenskyy was asked whether he believed European militaries alone had the strength to deter Russia or whether only an international force that included the United States would be credible. The president, speaking in Ukrainian, said: \"When we talk about this, is Europe enough? No. Because this isn't just a matter of numbers. It's about sharing responsibility and ensuring security guarantees.\" He continued: \"This cannot be pursued without the involvement of the United States. Doing so would be a major mistake. It could very well be Russia's desire to see Europe defending and supporting Ukraine without the US. That would give Russia an advantage, and I believe it could amount to a geopolitical and strategic win for them.\" He added: \"When we talk about security guarantees, we need the United States as the primary guarantor of security, alongside European countries. The European Union plus the United Kingdom - these European nations are crucial for us.\" Read more:David Lammy promises Â£55m in support for UkraineFather pays tribute to British teen killed in UkraineNorth Koreans 'blow themselves up with grenades' Donald Trump has said he will end the war in Ukraine, though he has not explained how. He plans to speak with Vladimir Putin and his team is talking to Mr Zelenskyy's side. Even if the US did agree to contribute to an international security force as part of a ceasefire deal, it would still be a huge undertaking for the UK and other European partners. Analysts question whether Britain's military would be able to take on the role in a credible way without a serious increase in defence spending and regrowing its shrunken forces. Mr Trump has said NATO allies should spend 5% of GDP on defence - more than double the level that the UK invests. Asked whether he thought the UK and other European allies needed to increase their military expenditure, Ukraine's president said: \"I don't know how much you need to contribute - two percent, three percent. But listen, we are spending our entire budget right now. \"I think that's your answer. If you don't want to be spending your entire budget on defence in the future, invest the necessary percentage today and take steps to strengthen your defence now.\""

        "Content": "\n          Political reporter\n              @fayebrownSky\n Grenfell campaigners say they have been told by the deputy prime minister that the tower block will be demolished, accusing her of \"ignoring the voices of bereaved\". In a statement, Grenfell United claimed Angela Rayner had not given a reason behind her decision and refused to say how many of the victims' families and survivors had been consulted. Confirming a meeting with the housing secretary on Wednesday, it said: \"Angela Rayner could not give a reason for her decision to demolish the tower. \"She refused to confirm how many bereaved and survivors had been spoken to in the recent, short four-week consultation. \"But judging from the room alone - the vast majority of whom were bereaved - no one supported her decision. \"But she claims her decision is based on our views. \"Today's meeting showed just how upset bereaved and survivors are about not having their views heard or considered in this decision. \n                  Grenfell fire families sent letter about unidentified remains\n                 \n                  Cladding safety work needs target date to stop residents living with fear of fire, says government spending watchdog\n                 \n                  Housing minister Rushanara Ali loses brief after complaint by Grenfell survivors\n                 \"Ignoring the voices of bereaved on the future of our loved ones' gravesite is disgraceful and unforgivable.\" The government has previously said there will be no changes to the site before the eighth anniversary of the fire disaster, which claimed 72 lives  on 14 June 2017. It is expected more details will be set out by ministers by the end of the week. A spokesperson for Grenfell Next of Kin, a separate group representing some bereaved families, earlier told the PA news agency that the decision around the tower's future was \"obviously a very sensitive and difficult\" one. They added: \"For the next of kin of the deceased, that building is a shrine and the death place of their immediate families, their brothers, sisters, mothers, fathers, husbands, wives and children - but they understand the hard facts around safety.\" Engineering experts have said that while the tower remains stable, and it is safe for people to live, work and study near by, its condition will worsen over time and there is no realistic prospect of bringing it back into use. The latest advice issued to the government in September was that the building, or the part of it that was significantly damaged, should be taken down. What is left of the tower has stood in place since the tragedy, with a covering on the building featuring a large green heart accompanied by the words \"forever in our hearts\". Views have varied on what should happen to the site. Some of the bereaved and survivors feel the tower should remain in place until there are criminal prosecutions over the failings which led to the disaster. The final report of the Grenfell Tower Inquiry, published in September, concluded the fire was the result of \"decades of failure\" by government and the construction industry to act on the dangers of flammable materials on high-rise buildings. The west London tower block was covered in combustible products because of the \"systematic dishonesty\" of firms who made and sold the cladding and insulation, inquiry chairman Sir Martin Moore-Bick said. He said the \"simple truth\" is that all the deaths were avoidable and that those who lived in the tower were \"badly failed\" by authorities \"in most cases through incompetence but, in some cases, through dishonesty and greed\". However, the Metropolitan Police said last year that decisions on criminal charges for the Grenfell Tower blaze are not expected until the end of 2026. It would mean a near 10-year wait for justice if anyone is ultimately charged - a length described by families as \"unbearable\". The disaster was Britain's deadliest residential fire since the second world war and began a national reckoning over the safety and conditions of social housing and tower blocks.  Separately, the Grenfell Tower Memorial Commission has been consulting on plans for a permanent memorial in the area of the tower. A shortlist of five potential design teams was announced last month, with a winner expected to be selected this summer to enable a planning application to be submitted in late 2026. A government spokesperson said: \"The priority for the deputy prime minister is to meet with and write to the bereaved, survivors and the immediate community to let them know her decision on the future of the Grenfell Tower. \"This is a deeply personal matter for all those affected, and the deputy prime minister is committed to keeping their voice at the heart of this.\""

The second was for online activity relating to Libya and Colonel Gaddafi, and the third for searching for London bombings, the IRA and the Israel-Palestine conflict. \"On each of these occasions, the decision at the time was that the perpetrator should not progress to the Channel multi-agency process,\" Mr Jarvis said. ðŸ‘‰ Listen to Sky News Daily on your podcast app ðŸ‘ˆ The report highlighted that in the second referral, Rudakubana's name was spelt differently from the first. It then says a Prevent supervisor was unable to find the previous referral and \"this may have caused the case to be closed quickly on minimal information\". As part of the review, 14 recommendations were made on how to improve Prevent, which Mr Jarvis said they had accepted and would be implementing. Mr Jarvis said the government was working to set up an inquiry into what happened as soon as possible, although confirmed it would not initially be on a statutory footing.

He said: \"It shows that part of the challenge was to try to work out did this guy have an ideology. The public might think that's a very specific point but the Prevent programme is based on counterterrorism. \"For terrorism, you need to have an ideology behind your act of violence. This report says they should have looked closer at that and should have perhaps termed it as an unclear or mixed ideology. \"The report also shows the challenges of the overlap with mental health and autism. The only positive thing is that there will be a public inquiry that will look into these issues in greater depth.\" He added: \"The report shows the complexity of trying to assess people and whether they are going to take their perverted ideas and issues into more serious violence. \"This is an absolute tragedy and I know the officers involved and the wider counter terrorism network will be really, really upset that this guy got through the net and they weren't able to prevent the horrific attack he carried out.\""

        "Content": "\n          Home editor\n              @JasonFarrellSky\n This is a government acknowledgement of what we already knew; that the system failed. There were three chances to act, which certainly cumulatively, but even individually, should have seen Rudakubana placed in a system designed to de-radicalise him, even if his ideology was poorly formed and hard to define. Today's report for the government suggests, even in his first referral to Prevent, enough was known to put Rudakubana into the Channel programme. The report says a number of factors pointed to \"his vulnerability of being drawn to terrorism\", such as researching school shootings, talking about stabbing people, and stating the terrorist attack on 'MEN' was a good thing - this probably a reference to the Manchester Arena attack. He was young with complex needs. Even though his ideology wasn't understood - it was an opportunity to try to understand it and work him out of it. Instead, in December 2019, the assessor decided Rudakubana had \"no ideological driver\" beyond \"a potential obsession with mass violence\" and so placed him in a category called Mixed, Unclear or Unstable (MUU) which by its very name shows that they are unable to conclude whether he is dangerous or not. Today's rapid report identified another significant factor that might motivate this type of violence: \"grievances.\" \n                  Jess Phillips suggests people could lose their jobs over failure to prevent Southport attack\n                 \n                  'Terrorism has changed': Southport attack a sign the country faces a new threat, PM says\n                 \n                  Rishi Sunak would add 'vilification of UK' to extremism definition if he becomes prime minister\n                 In this case, Rudakubana was bullied at school and the report implies these \"behavioural factors\" should be given more weight in assessments. The review also suggests that not enough general background checking is happening. On the second referral in February 2021, the decision not to place Rudakubana into Channel is made on \"minimal information\", not speaking directly to the person who reported the concerns, nor Rudakubana's parents, nor checking internet searches at the school. Read more:Why violent motivations are becoming harder to defineFormer social worker warns over 'holes in the system'Southport killer jailed for minimum of 52 years It seems as if processes were largely followed, but this review criticises the subjective decisions made and the lack of professional curiosity, considering the same person crops up three times. The rapid review calls on the Prevent system to strengthen its risk assessments, particularly where there isn't a coherent ideology, and to recognise the potential risk from repeat referrals. But, perhaps the most depressing finding is that on his second referral there was a spelling error of his name as Rudukubana. Just one 'u' instead of an 'a' may have meant previous referrals didn't show up in searches."

Burley, 64, was part of the team that launched Sky News in 1989 and has been the face of the channel ever since, covering royal events, general elections and other major stories. Closing her final show on the Sky News Breakfast programme, she said: \"From a standing start to one of the most recognised and valued brands in global news, it's been an honour and privilege to work with some of the best and hardest working teams in the business. \"News by its very nature is often devastating and together we've covered so many life-changing events - from the tragic death of Diana, the shocking terror attack of 9/11; the Asian Tsunami; the Concorde air disaster. \"But we've also enjoyed some wonderful high notes too, haven't we - the thrill of London winning the chance to host the 2012 Olympics; a plethora of royal weddings; jubilees and who can forget days and days and DAYS waiting for royal babies to arrive at the Lindo Wing. \"But after over a million minutes of live TV news - more than anyone else in the world - it's time for me to indulge in some of my other passions - including my love for travel. \"So, after covering 12 separate general elections - including Sir Keir Starmer's victory last year - I am retiring from Sky News - let politicians of every party just rejoice at that news! \"Thank you for waking up and tuning in every morning. I can't tell you how much I have appreciated your support over the last three and a half decades: You're awesome. \"I will post more on my social media and hope to see you around. Please keep in touch.\"  'Unmatched legacy' Raised in Wigan, Lancashire, Burley took her first steps into journalism at 17, reporting for the Wigan Evening Post and Chronicle. She secured a job with the BBC on its local radio stations and then on a local TV before being recruited by Scottish broadcaster Andrew Neil and moved to the fledgling Sky News in the 1980s as one of its founding presenters. Her live coverage of 9/11 won Sky News a BAFTA award. David Rhodes, executive chairman of Sky News, said: \"With millions of minutes presenting live rolling news, Kay's legacy in television journalism is unmatched, as is her commitment to Sky's legacy. And I'm sure some MPs in Westminster will sleep easy knowing they won't face her indomitable questioning in the mornings.\" He added: \"We thank Kay for her huge contribution to Sky, to the art of the interview and to British journalism. And we wish her the best of luck.\" Former Sky News editor-at-large Adam Boulton posted on X: \"The one and only Kay Burley announces she is leaving Sky News. \"Kay is unique, there are no other women of her background who have had such an impact on British News and current affairs. We have been friends and colleagues for forty years. Onward Kay I know it's going to be exciting!\" Sky News's political editor Beth Rigby said: \"No one does live telly like Kay Burley. Our anchor woman for decades, Kay's has been THE face of Sky News for as long as I can remember.\" Rigby added: \"She's been a trailblazer & inspiration to a whole generation of women. You're one of a kind.\" Former Sky News journalist Simon McCoy shared an image on X from when he worked with Burley and wrote: \"That's how long she worked at Sky News! \"Wishing Kay Burley all the best for whatever comes next.\" Sky News business presenter Ian King posted on X: \"It is impossible to overstate the achievements of my brilliant and supportive friend @KayBurley. \"No one in the world has clocked up as many hours of live television. No doubt politicians will be glad she is leaving - her loyal viewers will not.\" Good Morning Britain presenter Susanna Reid called Burley \"a fierce advocate for viewers, a powerful interviewer and a supporter of women in television\".

The announcement was made by the star's wife Sharon Osbourne and bandmate Tony Iommi at Villa Park in Birmingham, which will host the gig on 5 July. The Back To The Beginning show will be the heavy metal band's first performance together in 20 years, with original stars Osbourne, Iommi, Geezer Butler and Bill Ward. It will also feature sets from acts including Metallica, Slayer, Alice In Chains and a \"supergroup of musicians\" including Duff McKagan and Slash (Guns 'n' Roses), Billy Corgan (The Smashing Pumpkins), Fred Durst (Limp Bizkit) and Tom Morello (Rage Against The Machine). Osbourne, 76, who has faced health problems including Parkinson's disease in recent years, will play his own short set before joining his bandmates \"for his final bow\". 'One regret' His wife Sharon told Sky News that for Ozzy \"there's one regret for everything that's happened to him in the last six years. \"He said he never got a chance to say thank you to his fans and here we are, he's going to say thank you, he's going to give back to the city, with his brothers who are Sabbath... It's the perfect farewell.\" Sharon acknowledged there would be \"a lot of tears\" but also \"a lot of great memories\". Profits will be shared between Cure Parkinson's, Birmingham Children's Hospital, and Acorn's Children's Hospice, organisers said. About Cure Parkinson's, Sharon said they wanted to raise awareness of the cause as \"there is no cure right now\" but there is \"hope that in our lifetime there will be a cure, not for Ozzy but for the younger generation\". 'Birmingham forever' Osbourne said in a statement: \"It's my time to go Back to the Beginning, time for me to give back to the place where I was born. \"How blessed am I to do it with the help of people whom I love. \"Birmingham is the true home of metal.

Despite his health problems, he has appeared at some one-off shows in recent years - including the Commonwealth Games in Birmingham in 2022 and at half-time during an NFL game in California in the same year. Black Sabbath formed in Birmingham in 1968 and went on to become one of the most successful metal bands of all time, selling more than 75 million albums worldwide over the years. Morello, who is also music director for the reunion show, said: \"This will be the greatest heavy metal show ever.\" Other acts confirmed for the gig include Pantera, Gojira, Halestorm, Lamb Of God, Anthrax and Mastodon. More names will be announced shortly, organisers said. Tickets go on sale at 10am on Friday 14 February."

He was attracted to girls in their early to mid-teens and used social media including Snapchat and Instagram to target and make contact with his victims, manipulating and grooming the girls before sexually abusing them. He was 20 when he groomed his first victim, aged 14, through Facebook in 2010 and went on to groom an 11-year-old, when he was aged 27, through Snapchat.

        "Content": " Donald Trump's announcement that he wants to \"develop\" Gaza and turn it into the \"Riviera of the Middle East\" has been described as \"absurd\" and \"entirely unrealistic\". During a joint news conference with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu late on Tuesday, Mr Trump proposed that the two million people living in Gaza could be moved to Jordan, Egypt - and beyond. Gazans hit back at Trump's plan; US latest While it is not clear how Gaza will be rebuilt when the current conflict between Hamas and Israel ends - it is equally uncertain how the US would come to \"own\" Gaza, resettle its population, and redevelop the land. What did Trump say about the Gaza Strip? Mr Trump described Gaza as a \"demolition site\" where \"virtually every building is down\". Laying out his idea of what would happen beyond an Israel-Hamas ceasefire, he proposed: \"The US will take over the Gaza Strip and we will do a job with it too.\" He said America would be \"responsible for dismantling all of the dangerous unexploded bombs and other weapons on the site\", before it would \"get rid of the destroyed buildings\", and \"level it out\". He envisioned an \"economic development\", which he described as the \"Riveria of the Middle East\" - that would create thousands and thousands of jobs\". \"Everybody I've spoken to loves the idea of the United States owning that piece of land, developing and creating thousands of jobs,\" he added. The White House has described the plan as \"out-of-the-box\" and \"visionary\". What about the population? Gaza's two million people would not return to their territory under Mr Trump's plans. Instead, he suggested building \"various domains\" for them to \"permanentlyâ€¦ live out their lives in peace and harmony instead of having to go back and do it again\". This could take the form of \"numerous sites\" or \"one large site\", he added. Read moreAnalysis: So outrageous it might be something biggerAnalysis: Plan betrays Trump's ignorance of history The only locations he mentioned by name were Jordan and Egypt, which he said, despite their leaders consistently refusing to resettle more Palestinian refugees, would \"give us the kind of land we need to get this done\". He described the new sites as a \"beautiful area to resettle people, permanently in nice homes, where they can be happy and not shotâ€¦ and killedâ€¦ like what's happening in Gaza\". He said \"neighbouring countries of great wealth\" could finance them - without stipulating to what extent this would involve the US. There were no details on whether the plans change the current US position of a two-state solution for the Israeli and Palestinian people. Who controls Gaza - and who has occupied it in the past? Gaza has been under the control of Hamas since 2007 - after it dominated the 2006 elections and subsequent violent clashes with fellow Palestinian group Fatah. The area made up of Gaza, Israel, and the West Bank has a long and complicated history - with both Israel and Palestinians laying claim to various parts of it. In 1917, the British took control of what was then known as Palestine from the Ottoman Empire. Under the Balfour Declaration, they promised to create a Jewish homeland there. Jewish people then began migrating to the region in large numbers - accelerated by the threat of Nazism in Europe and the Second World War, which created tension with the Palestinian people already living there. When the United Nations was set up after the war in 1947, it proposed a partition plan - whereby roughly 45% of the land would belong to the Palestinian people and 55% to Jewish people. Jerusalem, which has particular sensitivities because of its religious significance to both sides, was proposed as a separate international territory. This plan was never actioned - and instead - the state of Israel was declared in 1948. The Arab-Israeli war that broke out immediately after the declaration saw 750,000 Palestinian people forced from their homes in what was known as the Nakba - or \"catastrophe\" in English. They were given refugee status by the UN and fled to neighbouring countries. The Palestinians retained control of two small areas - what we now know as Gaza and the West Bank. During the Six-Day War in 1967, Israel occupied Gaza, the West Bank, and East Jerusalem. They also took control of the Golan Heights, an area belonging to Syria. This saw hundreds of thousands more Palestinians forced from their homes. During his first presidency, Donald Trump recognised Israel's control of the Golan Heights. Different groups have fought for control of Gaza since then - including Hamas and the Palestinian Authority. There was hope for a two-state solution - one Israel and one Palestine - when their leaders signed the Oslo Accords committing to peace in the region within five years. This never materialised, however, and Gaza has become increasingly cut off from outside resources. The UN runs refugee camps for millions of displaced Palestinians - both inside Gaza and the West Bank - and in the neighbouring countries of Jordan, Lebanon, and Syria. Before the 2023 war broke out between Israel and Hamas, tensions were high among Palestinian communities as Israel continued to expand settlements in the West Bank and East Jerusalem. Trump Gaza plan 'absurd' and US has 'no authority' Egypt, Jordan, and Saudi Arabia, which as fellow Arab nations support the Palestinian cause, immediately rejected Mr Trump's ideas. They, along with Syria and Lebanon, are already struggling to support millions of displaced Palestinians. Hamas described the proposals as \"ridiculous and absurd\" in a statement from one of its officials Sami Abu Zuhri. The Palestinian Liberation Organisation reiterated its support for a two-state solution. Sky News Middle East correspondent Alistair Bunkall said the plans have left politicians and diplomats across the region \"speechless\". \"It's entirely unrealistic for so many reasons,\" he says.  Forcing Palestinians from Gaza would breach their right under international law to self-determination - and would constitute ethnic cleansing, he adds. It would also, according to the chair of the UK's Defence Select Committee, Conservative MP Tobias Ellwood, require \"a minimum of 50,000\" US troops in the region for several years. This would prove a \"massive logistical challenge\", as US military resources in other parts of the world have to be redirected there. It is also out of step with Mr Trump's previous indications he wants to scale back US involvement in the Middle East - and adopt a more protectionist foreign policy. Many Gazans have endured horrendous living conditions in the hope Gaza will be rebuilt as part of an independent Palestinian state. As such, most would not want to leave, Bunkall says, adding: \"Ask any Gazan and they will tell you it is their home, however hellish.\" The international community has been involved in the rebuilding of war-torn countries throughout the 20th and 21st centuries. In this sense, the US could be mandated as a \"reconstruction power\" in Gaza. However, in cases such as post-Second World War Germany or Japan - allies handed back the territory after rebuilding - not resettled their residents elsewhere."

        "Content": " A gunman who shot dead 10 people at an adult education centre had access to several weapons and had \"major problems\" at school, Swedish media have reported. The attack at an adult education centre in Orebro on Tuesday was described by the country's prime minister as the worst mass shooting in Sweden's history. In an update on Wednesday, police said the perpetrator appears to have shot himself - and added they are still unclear on the motive. Swedish media have named the attacker as Rickard Andersson, 35, who was said to have been unemployed for more than 10 years and attended a special class for people with Asperger's and high-functioning autism, Swedish channel TV4 reports. A hunting weapon for which he had a licence was found next to his body at the scene of the attack on Tuesday. The head of the local police, Roberto Eid Forest, said the centre's large premises meant it took a long time for officers to search the campus and ensure there were not any more victims. Police heard gunshots when they arrived and initially thought they were being fired at, he added. The shooting started about midday local time at Campus Risbergska in the town of Orebro, about 200km (125 miles) west of the capital Stockholm. The attack happened after many students had gone home following a national exam.  Students took shelter in nearby buildings and other parts of the campus were evacuated. Officials said three women and two men, all with gunshot wounds, underwent surgery at hospital. All were in a serious but stable condition after being admitted with life-threatening injuries. Another woman was treated for minor injuries and was stable. Two of the victims were in intensive care, a health official said, and all the victims were over the age of 18.  Read more: What we know about Sweden shooting so far Police previously said the number killed could rise. They said there were no warnings beforehand and they believe the perpetrator acted alone. The force has not said if the man was a student at the centre. The authorities said there were no suspected connections to terrorism at this point, but they have not suggested a possible motive for the attack. Officers raided the suspect's home after the shooting on Tuesday but they did not say what they found. Andersson was reported to have not had any income from any job since 2015, while his performance at school was also reviewed as \"problematic\", TV4 said, as he failed all subjects from the spring semester of grade eight and throughout grade nine. Andersson went on to study an individual programme before attending a special class for people with Asperger's and high-functioning autism at Wadkoping Education Centre in Orebro. He passed in aesthetic activities and history but failed in all other subjects. 'Blood everywhere on the floor' Andreas Sundling, 28, was among those forced to barricade themselves inside. \"We heard loud bangs and first we thought people were fighting outside and maybe throwing chairs and tables, [but] then we heard people screaming,\" he told Sky News. \"Then the people in my class realised that something is wrong. We closed all the doors to the classroom and we locked the doors and I barricaded the doors with tables and chairs.\" Mr Sundling said his class hid under the tables and he began thinking about his family, including his two-year-old daughter and six siblings. The student said there was \"blood everywhere on the floor\" inside the centre and it was \"crazy\". The centre is for students over the age of 20, according to its website. It offers primary and upper secondary school courses, as well as Swedish classes for immigrants, vocational training and programmes for people with intellectual disabilities. Sweden's prime minister Ulf Kristersson said the tragedy is the worst mass shooting in the country's history. \"Today, we have witnessed brutal, deadly violence against completely innocent people,\" Mr Kristersson told reporters. \"This is the worst mass shooting in Swedish history. Many questions remain unanswered, and I cannot provide those answers either. \"But the time will come when we will know what happened, how it could occur, and what motives may have been behind it. Let us not speculate,\" he said. The country's king Carl XVI Gustaf said the shooting was a \"terrible atrocity\".  \"We send our condolences tonight to the families and friends of the deceased. Our thoughts at this time also go to the injured and their relatives, as well as to others affected,\" he said. \"My family and I would like to express our great appreciation for the police, rescue and medical personnel who worked intensively to save and protect human lives on this dark day.\" Fatal attacks at educational establishments in Sweden are very rare, with 10 killed in seven incidents between 2010 and 2022, according to the Swedish National Council for Crime Prevention."

Bodies are decomposing on the streets of Goma, with 2,000 more collected across the region. Some 900 more bodies are in morgues, with Ms van de Perre saying her organisation \"expects the number [of those killed] to go up\".

Providing aid for displaced people has been made more difficult by US President Donald Trump's move to shut down USAID, with the UN saying this is \"hampering operations\". The UN said that violence has continued to escalate despite the rebels M23 declaring a unilateral ceasefire on Monday. The M23 rebels are backed by some 4,000 troops from neighbouring Rwanda, according to UN experts. They seized Goma in three days after fierce battles with Congolese forces. The rebels gained ground in eastern DRC on Wednesday despite the ceasefire, taking control of a town 60 miles from the provincial capital of Bukavu. Read more:EU facing pressure to drop Rwanda mineral dealWhat is the fighting in Democratic Republic of Congo about?Eyewitness account after rebels take key city The Office of the Prosecutor of the International Criminal Court called on Wednesday for the presentation of information and evidence regarding atrocities committed in eastern DRC. \"The office will continue to investigate alleged crimes committed by any person, irrespective of affiliation or nationality and will not be limited to particular individuals, parties or members of specific groups,\" the statement said. Goma, which remains under occupation, is home to two million people and is at the heart of a region home to trillions of dollars in mineral wealth. The M23 is the most potent of the more than 100 armed groups active in the area. Experts and analysts have expressed concern that Rwanda aims to take control of parts of DRC to ensure access to minerals. But Rwanda's government has framed the conflict as the defence of ethnic Tutsis in eastern DRC from ethnic Hutu forces linked to the genocide in Rwanda three decades ago that killed some 800,000 Tutsis, moderate Hutus and others. Rwandan forces have entered DRC in the past while asserting the same aim, helping to fuel what has become one of Africa's longest-simmering wars, with millions of Congolese displaced."

Clemenceau, Trone and Gare de l'Ouest underground stations were closed to the public while police searched for the perpetrators in the tunnels of the city's metro system, The Brussels Times reported. CCTV footage showed two people walking into the station and opening fire, according to the Reuters news agency. It said it could not immediately verify the images. \"The suspects fled in the direction of the metro station and may still be in the tunnel between the Clemenceau and Midi stations,\" a police spokesperson told Belga News Agency. \"The Brussels Midi police and the federal railway police are searching the area. No one was injured in the shooting.\" The suspects had aimed at a person but missed, Belgian broadcaster VRT reported. Belgian prosecutors said the incident was not being considered a terror attack. In a statement, the public prosecutor's office in Brussels said a forensics team was deployed to the scene of the shooting, including a ballistics expert. \"Several shell casings were found on site,\" it said. \"A major search operation was carried out, as video-surveillance footage showed two suspects fleeing into the metro tunnels.\" It added: \"No one has been arrested, but the investigation is continuing. \"At this stage, there is no indication of a terrorist motive for this shooting.\" Images showed emergency services - including firearms officers, paramedics and firefighters - at the scene, and a police cordon in place.

        "Content": "Ukraine has accused Russian spies of orchestrating several bomb attacks on its army recruitment offices, as authorities revealed the latest attack killed one person and injured four. An attack on Wednesday hit a conscription centre in the western Khmelnytskyi region. A man approached a checkpoint in the office, clutching a bag and asking to hand over a package. An explosion then happened, killing the man. Another conscription officer was shot dead at a petrol station last week. Separately, a young man was blown up last Saturday by an explosive device he had brought into a draft office in the northwestern city of Rivne, according to Ukrainian authorities.  Russian spies allegedly recruited the man and Russian security officers are said to have detonated the device remotely after he had entered the draft office. Eight Ukrainian servicemen were wounded in the blast. National police chief Ivan Vyhivskyi said: \"We... understand this is a deliberate attack by Russian special services that aims to create a false opinion in society, destabilise the situation and create a negative attitude towards the security and defence forces.\" Mr Vyhivskyi said there had been nine attacks organised by Russia already this year, including three targeting police officers. He did not provide evidence of Russian involvement, though such information is generally withheld for security reasons. The police chief said Russian intelligence officers were recruiting young men or people of \"low social responsibility\" to stage the attacks in return for money.

The blasts have piled more pressure on an already troubled national campaign to draft civilians into the armed forces. Enthusiasm among many military-age men to enlist has faded considerably since the start of the war. Senior military officials openly point to manpower shortages as a problem at the front, where Russian troops are advancing."

        "Content": " Multiple earthquakes rattling the Greek island of Santorini have prompted thousands of people to flee, disrupted travel for tourists and damaged infrastructure. Quakes up to a magnitude of five have been recorded in the region since Friday, with the island's mayor warning that seismic activity could continue for weeks. It has been described by Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis as an \"extremely complex and intricate geological phenomenon,\" according to state broadcaster EPT. Here is everything you need to know about the earthquakes hitting one of Greece's most popular tourist destinations. What's happening? Hundreds of quakes with magnitudes between 3 and 4.9 have been registered since Saturday between Santorini and the nearby island of Amorgos - which are both part of the Cyclades Islands. There have been a further 440 earthquakes below a magnitude of three and 73 above a magnitude of four since 1 February, EPT reported, citing the Geodynamic Institute. Seismologists have described the event as a series of tremors of similar magnitude occurring in clusters. They add that although Greece is no stranger to earthquakes, seismic activity of such frequency and intensity without having been preceded by a major quake is unusual. The epicentres of the quakes are beneath the seabed, which experts have said is good news as they will not be as destructive. Authorities said on Wednesday they have bolstered their emergency plans in case the tremors are a sign a larger quake will follow. There is also a possibility that an earthquake could trigger a volcanic eruption or tsunami. \"We are obliged to draw up scenarios for better and for worse regarding the prolonged seismic activity,\" civil protection minister Vassilis Kikilias said during a meeting with security officials, scientists and the prime minister. So far, there has been no significant damage and no injuries, although some minor rock slides have occurred and cracks in some older buildings have been reported. Public events have all been banned and local authorities were restricting access to clifftop areas that are among the biggest tourist draws to the island. Huge swathes of people have also left the islands due to the tectonic activity. Families have been pictured carrying young children, tourists dragging their suitcases, and car parks have filled with vehicles belonging to those who have left via ferry. A number of schools have also closed across several Greek islands. Why is it happening? Earthquakes occur when tectonic plates move suddenly along a fault line, releasing energy in the form of seismic waves. The shaking that results from these waves is what we feel during an earthquake. The fault line producing the current earthquakes in the Greek islands runs for about 120km (75 miles) but only the part between Santorini and Amorgos has been activated so far. Experts are still trying to determine whether the multiple quakes are foreshocks - smaller earthquakes before a major tremor - or whether they are part of an earthquake swarm of smaller quakes that could continue for weeks or months. \"There is no serious technology or approach to be able to predict what will happen from here on,\" Costas Papazachos, professor of applied geophysics and seismology at the University of Thessaloniki, said. How likely is volcanic activity? Santorini lies along the South Aegean Volcanic Arc, a chain of volcanoes which stretches from the Peloponnese in southern Greece through the Cyclades Islands. The island also has a caldera - a large, circular hollow that remains when the central part of a volcano falls in after an eruption. Last week, Greece's Climate Crisis and Civil Protection Ministry announced that sensors had picked up \"mild seismic-volcanic activity\" inside the caldera. There are two volcanoes in the area: Nea Kameni, which is within Santorini's caldera and Kolumbo, a volcano under the sea which is about 8km (5 miles) northeast of the island. There is also the volcanic island of Palia Kameni. Scientists have since said the current quakes are unrelated to the volcanic activity. Efthymios Lekkas, seismologist and head of the scientific monitoring committee for the Aegean Volcanic Arc, added that it has been 3,000 years since the last explosion. \"We have a very long time ahead of us before we face a big explosion,\" he said. Advice for tourists In an update to visitors on Tuesday, the government of Santorini warned hotels and all kinds of tourist accommodations to \"inform their visitors to avoid the dangerous points of the island\". The UK Foreign Office also shared a warning from the Greek ministry of civil protection that people are advised \"not to attend large indoor gatherings and to avoid old or abandoned buildings\". People have been advised to avoid the ports of Amoudi, Armeni, Korfos and Old Port in the area of Fira and to choose safe routes when travelling, particularly in areas where the landslide risk is high. \"In case of a strong tremor, people should immediately depart coastal areas,\" the ministry said. Push alerts have also been sent to mobile phones, and hotels have been urged to drain swimming pools because the water movement in a major quake could destabilise buildings. One resident who has already evacuated is tour guide Kostas Sakavaras who told Sky News' The World With Yalda Hakim that his family had fled to Athens \"as a precaution\". \"It's nerve-wracking to have every few minutes some tremor happening, even though it's not a very devastating one,\" he said. He added he had a \"feeling increasingly more people are leaving the island\". Read more from Sky News:What are your rights if your flight is delayed or cancelled?Manhunt after shooting at Brussels underground station How long will the tremors last? In a meeting on Wednesday, Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis said he was \"more optimistic\" than he was on Tuesday about the earthquakes not causing a bigger tremor, but could not make any firm predictions, EPT reported. Kostas Papazachos, professor of geophysics and seismology, added: \"Residents will continue to feel vibrations for the next period of time, and they should remain calm about it. \"The situation seems to be moving towards a better scenario in relation to seismic activity.\" The Earthquake Planning and Protection Organisation said last week the epicentre of the earthquakes in the Aegean Sea was moving northwards away from Santorini. It emphasised there was no connection to the area's dormant volcanoes. Some residents of the island have decided to remain in their homes while the seismic activity continues. Retired police officer and ship worker Panagiotis Hatzigeorgiou, who has lived on Santorini for more than three decades, said: \"Older residents are used to the earthquakes. \"But it's different this time. It's not the same to have earthquakes every two to three minutes. The main thing is not to worry,\" he said, adding: \"Now we can listen to music alone and have coffee by ourselves.\""

What you need to know about Trump's Gaza planFollow live: Trump latest But speaking on Wednesday, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt appeared to contradict Mr Trump's words and claimed he had said it would always be temporary. \"The president has made it clear that they need to be temporarily relocated out of Gaza for the rebuilding of this effort,\" she said to reporters. She continued: \"Again, it's a demolition site right now. It's not a liveable place for any human being. And I think it's actually quite evil to suggest that people should live in such dire conditions.\" Ms Leavitt also added that Mr Trump \"has not committed\" to sending troops to Gaza - but she did not rule it out. 'A massive row back' Sky News US correspondent Mark Stone was at the news conference where Ms Leavitt spoke. He said: \"I think what we heard there, reading between the lines, was a massive row back. \"She said that the relocation of Palestinians from Gaza while the territory is rebuilt would be temporary, and she said the president was 'very clear' about that. \"Well he wasn't very clear about that. He was very clear that it would be permanent. Indeed, he repeated this idea that they would be permanently relocated to 'somewhere beautiful', he said on many occasions yesterday. \"And so while she didn't acknowledge that there was a shift in position between yesterday and today, it was implicit in everything that she said.\" 'Deeply doubtful' Ex-Israeli prime minister Ehud Barak told Sky News he was \"deeply doubtful\" about the practicality of the plan.  He said: \"I cannot judge it, there are many in Israel who are really excited about it but it seems to me deeply doubtful whether it can ever fly. \"It's probably deliberately or subconsciously used as a leverage upon the Arab leaders to shake them up and to start to think about how they can contribute to avoid the need for America to intervene.

        "Content": " Donald Trump's announcement that he wants to \"develop\" Gaza and turn it into the \"Riviera of the Middle East\" has been described as \"absurd\" and \"entirely unrealistic\". During a joint news conference with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu late on Tuesday, Mr Trump proposed that the two million people living in Gaza could be moved to Jordan, Egypt - and beyond. Gazans hit back at Trump's plan; US latest While it is not clear how Gaza will be rebuilt when the current conflict between Hamas and Israel ends - it is equally uncertain how the US would come to \"own\" Gaza, resettle its population, and redevelop the land. What did Trump say about the Gaza Strip? Mr Trump described Gaza as a \"demolition site\" where \"virtually every building is down\". Laying out his idea of what would happen beyond an Israel-Hamas ceasefire, he proposed: \"The US will take over the Gaza Strip and we will do a job with it too.\" He said America would be \"responsible for dismantling all of the dangerous unexploded bombs and other weapons on the site\", before it would \"get rid of the destroyed buildings\", and \"level it out\". He envisioned an \"economic development\", which he described as the \"Riveria of the Middle East\" - that would create thousands and thousands of jobs\". \"Everybody I've spoken to loves the idea of the United States owning that piece of land, developing and creating thousands of jobs,\" he added. The White House has described the plan as \"out-of-the-box\" and \"visionary\". What about the population? Gaza's two million people would not return to their territory under Mr Trump's plans. Instead, he suggested building \"various domains\" for them to \"permanentlyâ€¦ live out their lives in peace and harmony instead of having to go back and do it again\". This could take the form of \"numerous sites\" or \"one large site\", he added. Read moreAnalysis: So outrageous it might be something biggerAnalysis: Plan betrays Trump's ignorance of history The only locations he mentioned by name were Jordan and Egypt, which he said, despite their leaders consistently refusing to resettle more Palestinian refugees, would \"give us the kind of land we need to get this done\". He described the new sites as a \"beautiful area to resettle people, permanently in nice homes, where they can be happy and not shotâ€¦ and killedâ€¦ like what's happening in Gaza\". He said \"neighbouring countries of great wealth\" could finance them - without stipulating to what extent this would involve the US. There were no details on whether the plans change the current US position of a two-state solution for the Israeli and Palestinian people. Who controls Gaza - and who has occupied it in the past? Gaza has been under the control of Hamas since 2007 - after it dominated the 2006 elections and subsequent violent clashes with fellow Palestinian group Fatah. The area made up of Gaza, Israel, and the West Bank has a long and complicated history - with both Israel and Palestinians laying claim to various parts of it. In 1917, the British took control of what was then known as Palestine from the Ottoman Empire. Under the Balfour Declaration, they promised to create a Jewish homeland there. Jewish people then began migrating to the region in large numbers - accelerated by the threat of Nazism in Europe and the Second World War, which created tension with the Palestinian people already living there. When the United Nations was set up after the war in 1947, it proposed a partition plan - whereby roughly 45% of the land would belong to the Palestinian people and 55% to Jewish people. Jerusalem, which has particular sensitivities because of its religious significance to both sides, was proposed as a separate international territory. This plan was never actioned - and instead - the state of Israel was declared in 1948. The Arab-Israeli war that broke out immediately after the declaration saw 750,000 Palestinian people forced from their homes in what was known as the Nakba - or \"catastrophe\" in English. They were given refugee status by the UN and fled to neighbouring countries. The Palestinians retained control of two small areas - what we now know as Gaza and the West Bank. During the Six-Day War in 1967, Israel occupied Gaza, the West Bank, and East Jerusalem. They also took control of the Golan Heights, an area belonging to Syria. This saw hundreds of thousands more Palestinians forced from their homes. During his first presidency, Donald Trump recognised Israel's control of the Golan Heights. Different groups have fought for control of Gaza since then - including Hamas and the Palestinian Authority. There was hope for a two-state solution - one Israel and one Palestine - when their leaders signed the Oslo Accords committing to peace in the region within five years. This never materialised, however, and Gaza has become increasingly cut off from outside resources. The UN runs refugee camps for millions of displaced Palestinians - both inside Gaza and the West Bank - and in the neighbouring countries of Jordan, Lebanon, and Syria. Before the 2023 war broke out between Israel and Hamas, tensions were high among Palestinian communities as Israel continued to expand settlements in the West Bank and East Jerusalem. Trump Gaza plan 'absurd' and US has 'no authority' Egypt, Jordan, and Saudi Arabia, which as fellow Arab nations support the Palestinian cause, immediately rejected Mr Trump's ideas. They, along with Syria and Lebanon, are already struggling to support millions of displaced Palestinians. Hamas described the proposals as \"ridiculous and absurd\" in a statement from one of its officials Sami Abu Zuhri. The Palestinian Liberation Organisation reiterated its support for a two-state solution. Sky News Middle East correspondent Alistair Bunkall said the plans have left politicians and diplomats across the region \"speechless\". \"It's entirely unrealistic for so many reasons,\" he says.  Forcing Palestinians from Gaza would breach their right under international law to self-determination - and would constitute ethnic cleansing, he adds. It would also, according to the chair of the UK's Defence Select Committee, Conservative MP Tobias Ellwood, require \"a minimum of 50,000\" US troops in the region for several years. This would prove a \"massive logistical challenge\", as US military resources in other parts of the world have to be redirected there. It is also out of step with Mr Trump's previous indications he wants to scale back US involvement in the Middle East - and adopt a more protectionist foreign policy. Many Gazans have endured horrendous living conditions in the hope Gaza will be rebuilt as part of an independent Palestinian state. As such, most would not want to leave, Bunkall says, adding: \"Ask any Gazan and they will tell you it is their home, however hellish.\" The international community has been involved in the rebuilding of war-torn countries throughout the 20th and 21st centuries. In this sense, the US could be mandated as a \"reconstruction power\" in Gaza. However, in cases such as post-Second World War Germany or Japan - allies handed back the territory after rebuilding - not resettled their residents elsewhere."

And the president delivered a blunt warning from the White House: \"Nobody's going to be able to do a damn thing about it.\" The International Olympic Committee cannot have been surprised. Trump had been riffing off this inflammatory rhetoric throughout the campaign, complaining transgender women competing in women's events are cheating and endangering rivals. This East Room ceremony - surrounded by female athletes - turned the policy pledge into reality through an executive order. \"This is one of the big reasons that we all won,\" he said, between meandering into how he could have built a bigger ballroom for the occasion. \n                  White House suggests Palestinians won't be permanently resettled - as ex-Israeli PM casts doubt on Trump plan\n                 \n                  Donald Trump signs executive order banning trans women athletes from competing in female sports\n                 \n                  Trump tariff threat saw US imports hit record high\n                 How will the IOC cope with Trump in the build up to LA 2028? That could be determined by their own presidential election outcome in March. One candidate, Sebastian Coe, is already chiming with Trump, having already excluded anyone assigned male at birth from women's categories in his role as World Athletics president. For now this US order only directly impacts education institutions receiving federal funding.  But Trump is putting pressure on the IOC, which leaves eligibility rules to each sport to determine. \"In Los Angeles in 2028 my administration will not stand by and watch men beat and batter female athletes,\" Trump said. \"We're just not going to let it happen and it's going to end and it's ending right now.\" How many athletes would this policy have impacted at the Paris 2024 Olympics? Technically, none. ðŸ‘‰ Listen to Sky News Daily on your podcast app ðŸ‘ˆ There was a trans man fighting who was female at birth. And two non-binary athletes competing in their assigned sex at birth categories. They are not in Trump's sights. But two female boxers were targeted, falsely classified by Trump as trans women based on disputed gender eligibility tests. Secretary of State Marco Rubio has been told to \"make clear to the International Olympic Committeeâ€¦ that America categorically rejects transgender lunacy\". Trump added: \"We want them to change everything to do with the Olympics and this absolutely ridiculous subject.\" Maybe this was the moment the IOC started regretting awarding 2028 to Los Angeles. Trump boasts about winning that Olympic vote during his first term having never anticipated being in power for the Games themselves.

The Department of Homeland Security was ordered \"to deny any and all visa applications made by men attempting to fraudulently enter the United States while identifying themselves as women athletes\". Activists advocating for LGBT+ rights in sport decried the targeting of another marginalised community by the Trump administration. Athlete Ally said in a statement: \"Our hearts break for the trans youth who will no longer be able to know the joy of playing sports as their full and authentic selves.\" But many across the United States are sure to endorse Trump delivering on his \"common sense\" agenda. \"You've been waiting a long time for this,\" he said, before signing the \"No Men in Women's Sports\" executive order into law."

The collision involving an American Airlines flight and an army helicopter near Reagan Washington National Airport was the deadliest US aviation incident in almost 25 years. Officials said all but one of the victims of the 29 January crash above the Potomac River have been positively identified. It came as it was confirmed crews working in difficult conditions had recovered a number of large pieces of the jet from the river. It is hoped work to recover the helicopter wreckage will start on Wednesday. \"Our hearts are with the victims' families as they navigate this tragic loss,\" officials said in a joint statement from the city and federal agencies involved in the search and recovery. The chief medical examiner will be working to positively identify the final set of remains, officials said. Updated data shows the Black Hawk helicopter was flying at 300ft on the air traffic control display at the time of the collision. The data indicates the military helicopter was above 200ft, which officials said is the maximum permitted altitude for the route it was using. Investigators earlier revealed the plane, which was about to land, was at 325ft, plus or minus 25ft, at the time of impact.  Sixty passengers and four crew were on the American Airlines flight from Wichita, Kansas. The Black Hawk, carrying three soldiers, was on a training mission.

Sky News has learnt that Nigel Railton, the Post Office chairman, told a group of MPs this week that Britain's biggest retailer had informed it of a potential interest in taking over the sites. One MP who attended the talks on the future of the directly managed branches said that Mr Railton had given the impression in his remarks that Tesco was among a small number of suitors which could take over the entire 108-strong network. Money latest: Tesco trialling major Clubcard changeRead more: Full list of Crown sites under threat The fate of the Crown Post Offices was called into question last autumn as part of a wider strategic review initiated by Mr Railton, who took over as chair of the company following Henry Staunton's sacking by Kemi Badenoch, the then business secretary. Collectively, the branches employ close to 1,000 people, with many of those jobs likely to be safeguarded in the event of an acquisition of the whole network by a single retailer. The meeting between Mr Railton and more than 20 MPs was organised to discuss the future of the directly managed branches, which form a very small part of the wider Post Office network. Trade union officials have expressed concern about the company's plans.  Following several enquiries, Tesco eventually responded by saying it would not comment. A Post Office spokesperson said: \"We are fully committed to engaging openly and transparently with MPs regarding any potential plans related to our Directly Managed Branch (DMB) network. \"Since inviting expressions of interest for 108 Post Offices that we currently operate, we have received interest from retail partners and independent postmasters in the hundreds. \"We remain committed to engaging with our trade unions over the potential future ownership of our Directly Managed Branches, which are loss-making for us, into March before updating our colleagues who work in these branches on any potential next steps.\" Read more from Sky News:'Godfather' of AI warns of arms race risksGrey belt planning policy 'not thought throughElectric car demand hits record but misses target The strategic review outlined in November is designed to bolster sub-postmasters' pay substantially during the coming years.

Official figures showed a 3.5% leap in imports compared to the previous month as the clock ticked down to Mr Trump's return to the White House on 20 January. The Commerce Department recorded a sum of $364.9bn of total imports. Exports fell by 2.6% on November to $266.5bn. Money latest: UK interest rate cut almost certain It meant that the US trade deficit - the value gap between imports and exports - hit its highest level since March 2022, the report said.

He later confined his immediate threats to China, Canada and Mexico.  To date, only products from China are subject to the additional tax. Mr Trump agreed to pause 25% tariffs against his closest neighbours at the 11th hour following phone calls with his Mexican counterpart Claudia Sheinbaum and Canada's outgoing prime minister Justin Trudeau. His arguments with both nations are not just restricted to trade but also flows of illegal drugs across the US border. It remains to be seen whether the delays will result in a truce but Mr Trump is widely expected to turn his tariff firepower towards the European Union, saying this week that the trading bloc will \"definitely\" face tariffs over its treatment of the US. He has been less definite in his views on the UK but hinted that the country should avoid them.  Read more: Why UK should escape Trump tariffsBritain could do slimmed down trade deal with US within months All the talk of tariffs since Mr Trump's election victory has been blamed for hitting economic sentiment globally. Strong US economic fundamentals The latest US data has shown that the world's largest economy grew at a 2.3% annualised rate during the final three months of 2024. That rate places it at the top of the G20 growth rankings. While there are concerns that US import tariffs could force up domestic inflation, the fundamentals of the US economy are strong. The same cannot be said for Europe where major economies such as Germany, which is in recession, France and the UK are all suffering from weak growth but for different reasons. Manufacturing powerhouse Germany has lost its competitive edge since access to cheap Russian gas was ripped from its factories following the outbreak of the Russia-Ukraine war. While France remains in a political vacuum that widely dented confidence, the cogs of the UK economy ground to a halt in the second half of last year when warnings from the new Labour government of black holes in the public finances and the need for a tough budget hit sentiment. The threat of Trump trade tariffs has not helped either. The fear is that a long period of global trade disruption will depress still further the chances of economic recovery."

Battery EVs (BEVs) accounted for 21% of almost 140,000 new car registrations in January, the highest-ever share for the month and a year-on-year increase of 41.6%. It establishes BEVs as the second-largest sector of the new car market, behind only petrol, which contracted by 15% to make up just over 50% of registrations. In an overall market that shrank by 2.5%, diesel registrations declined to just over 6% of registrations. Hybrid electric made up 13% of the market, and plug-in hybrids 9%, underlining the consumer shift towards full or partial electric powertrains.  Money blog: You might not want to leave savings in a high street bank Despite the growth of electric sales, manufacturers continue to warn that the market will not support the growth required to hit government EV targets, and called for consumer incentives and the extension of tax breaks. Under net-zero targets introduced by the last government, manufacturers will face fines of Â£15,000 per vehicle if electric vehicle sales fall short of 28% of total production this year, an increase from 22% in 2024. Read more:Grey belt planning policy 'rushed' and 'not thought through' - Lords reportMPs demand answers on sanctions regime after Sky News investigation The new government says it is committed to the total phase-out of new petrol and diesel car sales in 2030 but is currently reviewing the target regime to allow greater flexibility. Manufacturers who fall short of their target can buy credits from competitors who exceed EV market share, or offset them against emission reduction elsewhere in the business. Last year this allowed the industry to hit its 22% target despite vehicle sales of just below 20%.  The Society for Motor Manufacturers and Traders warned that EV sales are on course to hit only 23.7% this year, and that will only be achieved through discounting that it says cost the industry Â£4.5bn last year. With the market largely driven by company fleet sales, which benefit from tax breaks, the SMMT called for consumer incentives to support private purchases and urged the abandonment of plans to introduce vehicle excise duty (VED) in April. The plans will see BEVs costing more than Â£40,000, currently tax-exempt, subject to the 'expensive car supplement'. \"January's figures show EV demand is growing - but not fast enough to deliver on current ambitions,\" said chief executive Mike Hawes. \"Affordability remains a major barrier to uptake, hence the need for compelling measures to boost demand, and not just from manufacturers. \"The application, therefore, of the 'expensive car supplement' to VED on electric vehicles is the wrong measure at the wrong time. \"Rather than penalising EV buyers, we should be taking every step to encourage more drivers to make the switch, helping meet government, industry and societal climate change goals.\" Thinktank the Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit hailed the figures as an encouraging start to the year, and said the British car industry was on course to hit its annual target if EV sales followed recent patterns of growth. \"It's a record-breaking January for EV sales, and the sixth month on the bounce in which more than one in five new cars sold in the UK was an EV,\" said transport lead Colin Walker. \"This comes on the back of the car industry as a whole successfully complying with the government's EV targets in 2024, with prices driven down as manufacturers compete for sales. \"Last January, EVs accounted for 14.7% of all cars sold, but sales grew throughout the year, allowing the industry as a whole to comply with the ZEV mandate in its first year. This has been a stronger start to the year, meaning the car industry looks even better set to hit its EV targets in their second year.\""

        "Content": "\n          Political reporter\n              @fayebrownSky\n Grenfell campaigners say they have been told by the deputy prime minister that the tower block will be demolished, accusing her of \"ignoring the voices of bereaved\". In a statement, Grenfell United claimed Angela Rayner had not given a reason behind her decision and refused to say how many of the victims' families and survivors had been consulted. Confirming a meeting with the housing secretary on Wednesday, it said: \"Angela Rayner could not give a reason for her decision to demolish the tower. \"She refused to confirm how many bereaved and survivors had been spoken to in the recent, short four-week consultation. \"But judging from the room alone - the vast majority of whom were bereaved - no one supported her decision. \"But she claims her decision is based on our views. \"Today's meeting showed just how upset bereaved and survivors are about not having their views heard or considered in this decision. \n                  Grenfell fire families sent letter about unidentified remains\n                 \n                  Cladding safety work needs target date to stop residents living with fear of fire, says government spending watchdog\n                 \n                  Housing minister Rushanara Ali loses brief after complaint by Grenfell survivors\n                 \"Ignoring the voices of bereaved on the future of our loved ones' gravesite is disgraceful and unforgivable.\" The government has previously said there will be no changes to the site before the eighth anniversary of the fire disaster, which claimed 72 lives  on 14 June 2017. It is expected more details will be set out by ministers by the end of the week. A spokesperson for Grenfell Next of Kin, a separate group representing some bereaved families, earlier told the PA news agency that the decision around the tower's future was \"obviously a very sensitive and difficult\" one. They added: \"For the next of kin of the deceased, that building is a shrine and the death place of their immediate families, their brothers, sisters, mothers, fathers, husbands, wives and children - but they understand the hard facts around safety.\" Engineering experts have said that while the tower remains stable, and it is safe for people to live, work and study near by, its condition will worsen over time and there is no realistic prospect of bringing it back into use. The latest advice issued to the government in September was that the building, or the part of it that was significantly damaged, should be taken down. What is left of the tower has stood in place since the tragedy, with a covering on the building featuring a large green heart accompanied by the words \"forever in our hearts\". Views have varied on what should happen to the site. Some of the bereaved and survivors feel the tower should remain in place until there are criminal prosecutions over the failings which led to the disaster. The final report of the Grenfell Tower Inquiry, published in September, concluded the fire was the result of \"decades of failure\" by government and the construction industry to act on the dangers of flammable materials on high-rise buildings. The west London tower block was covered in combustible products because of the \"systematic dishonesty\" of firms who made and sold the cladding and insulation, inquiry chairman Sir Martin Moore-Bick said. He said the \"simple truth\" is that all the deaths were avoidable and that those who lived in the tower were \"badly failed\" by authorities \"in most cases through incompetence but, in some cases, through dishonesty and greed\". However, the Metropolitan Police said last year that decisions on criminal charges for the Grenfell Tower blaze are not expected until the end of 2026. It would mean a near 10-year wait for justice if anyone is ultimately charged - a length described by families as \"unbearable\". The disaster was Britain's deadliest residential fire since the second world war and began a national reckoning over the safety and conditions of social housing and tower blocks.  Separately, the Grenfell Tower Memorial Commission has been consulting on plans for a permanent memorial in the area of the tower. A shortlist of five potential design teams was announced last month, with a winner expected to be selected this summer to enable a planning application to be submitted in late 2026. A government spokesperson said: \"The priority for the deputy prime minister is to meet with and write to the bereaved, survivors and the immediate community to let them know her decision on the future of the Grenfell Tower. \"This is a deeply personal matter for all those affected, and the deputy prime minister is committed to keeping their voice at the heart of this.\""

        "Content": "The Conservative Party is pledging to tighten immigration rules after Reform topped a landmark poll for the first time earlier this week. In her first major policy announcement as Tory Party leader, Kemi Badenoch is pledging to double the amount of time an asylum seeker needs to have been in the UK before claiming indefinite leave to remain from five to 10 years. In order to claim indefinite leave to remain after 10 years, the individual must also meet new, tightened conditions. These include not having claimed benefits or used social housing during the entire qualification period, not having a criminal record and being able to demonstrate that their household would be a \"net contributor\". Ms Badenoch accused Labour of being \"not serious about tackling immigration\" and said there needs to be a \"new approach\". \"Our country is not a dormitory, it's our home,\" she said. \"The right to citizenship and permanent residency should only go to those who have demonstrated a real commitment to the UK. That's why we should double the length of time before people can qualify for indefinite leave to remain from five to 10 years. \n                  Reform UK tops landmark poll for first time\n                 \n                  Nigel Farage compares Reform polling with Donald Trump election victory\n                 \n                  Ex-minister involved in Liz Truss's mini-budget criticised for 'work ethic' comments\n                 \"The Conservative Party is under new leadership. We're going to tell the hard truths about immigration. \"The pace of immigration has been too quick and the numbers coming too high for meaningful integration. We need to slow down the track for citizenship. A UK passport should be a privilege not an automatic right. \"Far from reducing the number of people coming into Britain, the Labour government are presiding over an incoming disaster. \"The Border Security Bill will actually make it easier for illegal immigrants to stay in the UK, let alone legal migrants. No one can trust Labour on immigration.\" The announcement comes just days after Reform topped a Sky News/YouGov poll for the first time as the party continues to shake up British politics.  The poll, taken on 2 February and 3 February, showed Nigel Farage's party has edged in front on 25%, with Labour pushed into second on 24% and the Tories on 21%. It also put the Lib Dems on 14% and Greens on 9%. All the polling moves that push Reform UK to the top for the first time this week are within the margin of error and the overall picture remains unchanged - with Britain in a new period of three party politics in the polls. According to the poll, one in five Tory voters at the last election would now vote for Reform. The Sky News/YouGov poll also found Kemi Badenoch has slipped behind Nigel Farage when voters are asked whether they have a favourable or unfavourable opinion of the leaders. Last month, Badenoch had a net favourability rating of -25, but that has now dropped to -29 this month. This puts her below Farage, who had a net favourability rating of -32 last month, which has now risen to -27 this month. Labour's border security minister Dame Angela Eagle said: \"While [the Conservatives] scramble around for relevance, this Labour government is getting on with clearing up the mess they left behind - raising deportations, returns and removals to the highest rate in six years, increasing the number of illegal working raids and cutting the costs of the asylum system.\""

        "Content": "\n          Political reporter\n        Southport killer Axel Rudakubana's anti-terror case should have been kept open, a review into his attacks has found. Following the killings in Southport last summer, a rapid review was launched into Rudakubana's contact with Prevent - a government strategy aimed at stopping people from becoming terrorists. Speaking in the House of Commons, Home Office minister Dan Jarvis repeated that Rudakubana was in contact three times before his attacks at a Taylor Swift dance class where three young girls were murdered. Politics latest: Local elections delayed  He added that the report found Rudakubana should have been referred to Channel, another anti-terror scheme. Mr Jarvis said: \"The review concluded that too much focus was placed on the absence of a distinct ideology, to the detriment of considering the perpetrator's susceptibility, grievances, and complex needs. \"There was an under-exploration of the significance of his repeat referrals and the cumulative risk, including his history of violence. \"There were potentially incomplete lines of inquiry, that at the time the perpetrator could have fallen into a mixed, unclear or unstable category for Channel due to his potential interest in mass violence. \"Indeed, the overall conclusion of the review is that he should have been case-managed through the Channel multi-agency process, rather than closed to Prevent.\" He said the review found Rudakubana's referral to Prevent was \"closed prematurely\", and there was \"sufficient concern to keep the case active while further information was collected\".  The review noted Rudakubana was referred to Prevent on three occasions: first in December 2019 when he was 13, again in February 2021 when he was 14, and finally in April 2021. The first report was due to concerns he was carrying a knife and searching for school shootings online. The second was for online activity relating to Libya and Colonel Gaddafi, and the third for searching for London bombings, the IRA and the Israel-Palestine conflict. \"On each of these occasions, the decision at the time was that the perpetrator should not progress to the Channel multi-agency process,\" Mr Jarvis said. ðŸ‘‰ Listen to Sky News Daily on your podcast app ðŸ‘ˆ The report highlighted that in the second referral, Rudakubana's name was spelt differently from the first. It then says a Prevent supervisor was unable to find the previous referral and \"this may have caused the case to be closed quickly on minimal information\". As part of the review, 14 recommendations were made on how to improve Prevent, which Mr Jarvis said they had accepted and would be implementing. Mr Jarvis said the government was working to set up an inquiry into what happened as soon as possible, although confirmed it would not initially be on a statutory footing.

The public might think that's a very specific point but the Prevent programme is based on counterterrorism. \"For terrorism, you need to have an ideology behind your act of violence. This report says they should have looked closer at that and should have perhaps termed it as an unclear or mixed ideology. \"The report also shows the challenges of the overlap with mental health and autism. The only positive thing is that there will be a public inquiry that will look into these issues in greater depth.\" He added: \"The report shows the complexity of trying to assess people and whether they are going to take their perverted ideas and issues into more serious violence. \"This is an absolute tragedy and I know the officers involved and the wider counter terrorism network will be really, really upset that this guy got through the net and they weren't able to prevent the horrific attack he carried out.\""

        "Content": "\n          Chief political correspondent\n              @joncraig\n Is history repeating itself in the row over Sir Keir Starmer's voice coach Leonie Mellinger? After all, she is not the first person who has coached a prime minister to be caught in political controversy. After the Tories demanded a police probe, are there echoes of the row over Tony and Cherie Blair's \"lifestyle coach\" Carole Caplin? At Prime Minister's Questions, Sir Keir defended meeting Ms Mellinger during lockdown in 2020, claiming \"I was working\" while the Tories were \"partying\".  The Conservatives then stepped up their attacks, announcing that leader Kemi Badenoch wants a police investigation into whether laws were broken. That is not going to happen, however. The Metropolitan Police said that because the alleged offence was more than three years ago, no action will be taken. But have we been here before with a political row about a Labour prime minister receiving specialist coaching? In the 1990s, before and after he became PM, Ms Caplin coached Sir Tony and wife Cherie, advising him on fitness and his wife on style. And so, as the Tories continue attempting to embarrass Sir Keir over \"Voice Coach Gate\", are there similarities between his voice coach and Ms Caplin?  It has been suggested, for instance, that both have a racy past. Now 65, Ms Mellinger, an actress, was once married to the star of the \"Confessionsâ€¦\" movies, Robin Asquith. In her acting career, she appeared in Channel 4's political comedy The New Statesman as the leather-clad wife of a Conservative MP. She also appeared in the 1981 film of the bleak Doris Lessing novel Memoirs Of A Survivor, which also starred Nigel Hawthorne, later star of TV's Yes Minister. Carole Caplin, a former dancer who once dated Gary Numan and Adam Ant, hit the headlines in 1994 when The Sun published topless photos of her under the headline \"Secrets of Blairs' Girl Friday\". Read more:Gaza plan so outrageous, it might be part of something biggerManaging relations with the US, EU and China may not be easy To make matters worse, it happened at the very moment the then Labour leader, elected earlier in 1994, was celebrating a successful party conference speech. But much worse was to follow. In 2002 it emerged that Ms Caplin's boyfriend, Australian Peter Foster, was a conman with a conviction for conspiring to supply a weight-loss drink that turned out to be tea. The problem was that Foster had helped Cherie Blair buy two flats in Bristol when their eldest son Euan was at university there. The result was one of the biggest controversies of Sir Tony's premiership. More than 20 years later, it is now Sir Keir's turn to face questions about his own coaching. In the Commons, Tory MP Gagan Mohindra challenged the PM: \"Can he repeat his assurances that all rules were followed while the country was in tier 4 lockdown in December 2020, not just by him but his team as well, but also his voice coach Leonie Mellinger?\" Though he did not repeat the claim he made in Brussels on Monday that no rules were broken, a furious Sir Keir hit back: \"In December 2020, I was in my office working on the expected Brexit deal. \"With my team we had to analyse the deal as it came in at speed, prepare and deliver a live statement at speed on one of the most important issues for our country in recent years. That's what I was doing. \"What were they doing? Suitcases of food into Downing Street, partying and fighting, vomiting up the walls, leaving the cleaner to remove red wine stains. That's the difference: I was working, they were partying.\" But a spokesman for the Tory leader responded: \"The key question here is: is a voice coach a key worker who can travel from Tier 4 to Tier 3 during lockdown? \"It doesn't matter if you're part of a core team, that is the question. Now, Keir Starmer said that lawmakers can't be lawbreakers. It is almost unimaginable to disagree that that was a clear breach of the COVID rules.\" And asked if Mrs Badenoch thought police should investigate, he said: \"Yes, she does.\" Some years after the Carole Caplin controversy, Sir Tony wrote in his memoirs that she was \"a good friend and reliable confidant\" for his wife, but he should have acknowledged at the beginning that she was working for them. And as for Sir Keir, the threat of a police investigation into allegations of breaking lockdown rules did not last long. \"We can confirm we have received a report,\" said a Met Police spokesperson. \"The specific legislation that would be used by police forces dealing with offences during COVID has a three-year deadline for initiating proceedings. \"As this alleged incident falls outside of this timeframe, no action will be taken.\""

Dr Rosena Allin-Khan, a former shadow mental health minister who ran to be deputy leader, said the government needed to express \"in no uncertain terms\" its disapproval of the suggestion that Gazans be resettled into neighbouring countries. In a letter to Foreign Secretary David Lammy, seen by Sky News, the Labour MP for Tooting said the US president's comments risked sounding the \"final death knell\" for the internationally-supported two-state solution, in which an independent Palestinian state would exist alongside the state of Israel. \"I would like to express my outrage and ask that you take urgent steps to prevent this, including voicing the government's disapproval in no uncertain terms,\" she wrote. PMQs live: PM faces off with Badenoch \"This is not a humanitarian gesture of compassion - it is the forced removal of a population and a plan to ethnically cleanse Gaza,\" she added. Dr Allin-Khan, who was one of the 56 Labour MPs to break ranks and vote for a controversial SNP ceasefire motion last year, cited definitions of ethnic cleansing by the United Nations and the European Union as \"using force or intimidation to remove from a given area, persons of another ethnic or religious group\". \"The world intervened in the former Yugoslavia in the 1990s and roundly condemned ethnic cleansing in Rwanda,\" she added. \"We must meet these plans to remove millions of Palestinians from their homes, naked as they are, with the same robust response.\" She asked: \"Will the government stand firm and condemn President Trump's stated aim to take over and forcibly remove the Palestinian population of Gaza? \"Further to this, can you confirm that there will be no UK support or involvement in this disgraceful plan? Finally, will you work with the international community to support UN resolutions opposing the ethnic cleansing of Gaza?\"  Mr Trump sparked international alarm overnight when he laid out his plans for the Middle East in a news conference alongside Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu at the White House. The US president called Gaza a \"demolition site\" and said the two million people who currently live there could go to \"various domains\". He did not rule out sending US troops to the region, and said the US would \"develop\" Gaza and create \"thousands and thousands of jobs\". \"Everybody I've spoken to loves the idea of the United States owning that piece of land, developing and creating thousands of jobs,\" Mr Trump said, adding that Gaza could become \"the Riviera of the Middle East\" where \"the world's people\" could live.  Mr Trump suggested that Palestinians could be relocated to Egypt and Jordan. Both countries, other Arab nations and Palestinian leaders have all opposed this move. The US president's comments come at an awkward time for Sir Keir Starmer, as he seeks to build a close relationship with the US and stop the UK being subject to the punitive tariffs that have been imposed on China, Mexico and Canada - although the latter two countries have since earned a 30-day reprieve as negotiations take place.  The UK government has sought to distance itself from Mr Trump's remarks, with Mr Lammy saying the UK has \"always been clear in our belief that we must see two states\". \"We must see Palestinians live and prosper in their homelands in Gaza and the West Bank,\" he added. And speaking to Sky News' Kay Burley this morning, Environment Secretary Steve Reed said the UK's position was that Palestinians \"need to be able to return to their homes and then start to rebuild them\". Read more:Gaza plan so outrageous, it might be part of something biggerManaging relations with the US, EU and China may not be easy However, he stopped short of criticising Mr Trump for his remarks, saying that he would \"not provide a running commentary on the pronouncements of the president\". Asked if he was being disparaging, Mr Reed replied \"not at all\" and argued that Mr Trump should be given \"credit for the role he played in securing the ceasefire in the first place\". A Downing Street spokesperson later said the UK government would \"speak to President Trump and his team about all of his proposals\" when asked about Britain's position on his proposals to take over the Gaza strip. Asked whether Sir Keir believed that Mr Trump's proposals could form part of the process of rebuilding Gaza, his official spokesman said: \"We will talk to President Trump about all of his proposals, as you'd expect. \"But the UK's position is there must be a scenario where Palestinians are able to return home.\" The ceasefire between Israel and Gaza was agreed last month after more than a year of war following Hamas's terrorist attack on 7 October 2023, which killed 1,200 Israelis and saw 250 others taken hostage. More than 47,000 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza since Hamas's attack, according to local authorities. UN officials have estimated that around 200,000 Palestinians have made the journey to the north of the Gaza Strip after Israel lifted its closure of the area following the ceasefire deal."

They include former shadow chancellor John McDonnell, Apsana Begum and Zarah Sultana. It is not clear why these three remain suspended from the parliamentary party. Writing on X, Ms Sultana said she had only found out about this from a media report and suggested the reason was because she has been outspoken about the government's position on the war in Gaza. \"Turns out speaking up for Palestine is still a punishable offence,\" she said. Meanwhile Mr McDonnell, who served as the shadow chancellor under Jeremy Corbyn's leadership, said he did not expect the whip back until he knows if police will charge him following a recent pro-Palestinian protest after which he was interviewed under caution. As previously reported by Sky News, he and Mr Corbyn attended voluntary interviews over the rally last month, during which police claimed there had been a deliberate effort by protesters to breach conditions imposed on the event. The protest organisers and the two veteran MPs had denied this at the time, saying the delegation had peacefully walked to lay flowers for children killed in Gaza, with the assistance of police. Mr McDonnell posted on X: \"Pleased my colleagues got whip back but disappointed Zarah & Apsana haven't yet. \"Relaxed about my own position as I've made clear I don't expect whip back until we know whether police are to charge me following recent Palestinian demo after which I was interviewed under caution.\" The seven MPs lost the whip in July 2024 after they backed an SNP amendment to the King's Speech to scrap the two-child benefit limit. The cap prevents parents from claiming Universal Credit or a child tax credit for a third child, with a few exceptions.

Several Labour MPs had called on the new government to scrap the measure after the party won the general election last July. But reports that dozens of them could rebel did not materialise after threats of suspension emerged, with only seven of them ultimately siding with the SNP. At the time of their suspension, Labour said the decision would be reviewed in six months."

        "Content": "\n          Political reporter\n              @fayebrownSky\n Local elections in nine areas will be delayed for a year to allow for a shake-up of the council structure, Angela Rayner has announced. Votes scheduled for May would be postponed in East Sussex, West Sussex, Essex, Thurrock, Hampshire, the Isle of Wight, Norfolk, Suffolk and Surrey, said the deputy prime minister, who is also the housing, communities and local government secretary. Politics Live: Whip restored to four rebel Labour MPs  The reorganisation is part of Labour's manifesto commitment to widen devolution.  The party wants to abolish the two-tier system of county and district councils and merge them together to create larger unitary authorities. It also wants more areas to have regional mayors. Ms Rayner said that holding elections for bodies that were due to be scrapped would be \"an expensive and irresponsible waste of taxpayers' money\". But the Tories accused her of creating \"Orwellian-sounding\" structures which are \"closer to her and closer to Whitehall\". \n                  How Elon Musk took over British politics\n                 \n                  Government demands 'immediate, mandatory' housing plans from councils to build 1.5m homes\n                 \n                  Angela Rayner says newts can't be more protected than people who need housing\n                 The delayed elections will be held in May 2026 after the expected reorganisation. The nine areas make up half of the 18 councils that had written to Ms Rayner in January to be part of the first phase of restructuring, she told the Commons. Ms Rayner said the government's starting point \"is for all elections to go ahead unless there's a strong justification for postponement, and the bar is high\". She added: \"After careful consideration, I have only agreed to postpone elections in places where this is central to our manifesto promise to deliver devolution. \"We're not in the business of holding elections to bodies that won't exist and where we don't know what will replace them. This would be an expensive and irresponsible waste of taxpayers' money.\" As well as merging councils, the government wants more areas to have regional mayors like Greater Manchester's Andy Burnham.  'More money in people's pockets' In her statement, Ms Rayner announced six new devolution areas which she hoped would get to elect new mayors in May 2026: Cumbria, Cheshire and Warrington, Greater Essex, Hampshire and Solent, Norfolk and Suffolk, and Sussex and Brighton. A seventh area, Lancashire, is already deciding its mayoral devolution options and the government will look at leaders' proposals in the autumn \"in parallel with the priority programme\", Ms Rayner said. She said the places named in her statement will \"get a fast-track ticket to drive real change in their area\". \"While devolution can sound techie, the outcome is simple - it's a plan for putting more money in people's pockets, it's a plan for quicker, better, cheaper transport designed with local people in mind, a plan for putting politics back in the service of working people.\" Not all councils are due to hold elections in May. The government has written to all other councils in two-tier areas to invite them to develop unitary proposals, which ministers argue will cut waste and improve accountability. Read More:Whip restored to rebel Labour MPs - but three remain suspendedStarmer contradicts Trump on president's calls for Middle East 'Riviera' in Gaza 'Millions denied a vote' The County Councils Network welcomed Wednesday's announcement but said many areas will be disappointed they have not been selected for the priority programmes. \"There is clearly an appetite from many more county and unitary councils to move quickly and deliver devolution this Parliament.\" said Councillor Tim Oliver, chairman of the group. Opposition MPs from the left to the right attacked the plans. Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey called it a \"stitch-up\" between Labour and the Tories after his party made gains against the latter at the general election. \"Failing Tory-run councils are running scared and denying voters a chance to kick them out of office in May,\" he said. Responding for the Conservatives, shadow communities secretary Kevin Hollinrake said: \"Contrary to the Deputy Prime Minister's statement, she is not doing away with a two-tier system, she is simply creating a new tier of Orwellian-sounding strategic authorities which are closer to her and closer to Whitehall.\" Reform UK, which is hoping to make gains at the local elections, went furthest in its criticism, with party leader Nigel Farage saying it meant \"five and half million people in this country are being denied their vote\". \"Now I thought only dictators cancelled elections, but noâ€¦ this is the connivance of the now-terrified Labour Party,\" he said."

Mr Trump recently suspended funding to UNRWA, and the previous Conservative government did the same.  Israel has banned UNRWA from occupied East Jerusalem and Israel itself, having accused the agency of having close links to Hamas in Gaza - something the agency denies. The Reform MP asked: \"Will the prime minister agree with me that we should stop funding Hamas, follow the example of other nations and divert our aid to other, more trustworthy agencies?\" In response, Sir Keir said he had spoken to Ms Damari's mother on many occasions, \"including when she didn't know whether her daughter was alive or not\". ðŸ‘‰Listen to Politics At Jack And Sam's on your podcast appðŸ‘ˆ The prime minister added: \"But to be absolutely clear, and he knows this, we're not funding Hamas - we never will. \"We condemn Hamas, And everybody in this house should condemn Hamas.\""

Teams at Swansea University and King's College London have been working with scientists in Chile on the research. Work is ongoing to develop a new type of \"self-healing asphalt\" which can mend its own cracks. Scientists have found a way to reverse cracking, which could create more sustainable roads across the country. Dr Jose Norambuena-Contreras, a senior lecturer at Swansea University's department of civil engineering told Sky News it was a \"complex process\". \"The basic idea is in order to stimulate the materials to close the crack autonomously, without human intervention,\" he added.

The Conservative government put out formal guidance on how to ban mobile phones in schools almost exactly a year ago. It included advice on how to search students and their bags for devices \"if necessary\". But new evidence from the University of Birmingham has found students' levels of sleep, exercise and academic record did not differ between schools with and without phone bans. The study also found restrictive phone policies did not lower the overall time young people spend on their phones each day. The research, which has been peer-reviewed, compared 1,227 students and 30 different secondary schools. It appears to contradict a study from last summer that found schools that effectively ban mobile phones see better GCSE results. \"There is no evidence to support that restrictive school phone policies, in their current forms, have a beneficial effect on adolescents' mental health and wellbeing or related outcomes,\" the study concluded. It did, however, find that increased screen time impacted the mental health of students, as well as their classroom behaviour, physical activity levels and sleep cycles. Dr Victoria Goodyear, the study's lead author, told the BBC that school phone bans were not enough to tackle the negative impacts of mobile phone over-usage. \"This approach does not necessarily preclude restrictive school mobile phone policies,\" the study concluded. \"But these policies would be linked with a wider holistic approach to adolescent mobile phone and social media use.\" Read more:Donald's duck shooting condemnedTrump 'openly calling for ethnic cleansing'Why you might not want to leave your money in a high street account  The research comes days after the education secretary branded a Conservative party proposal to ban phones in classrooms a \"headline-grabbing gimmick\".

The event - scheduled to take place between 26 February and 9 March - will feature 13 world and European premieres, 66 UK premieres and 12 Scottish premieres from 38 countries. Glasgow Film Festival (GFF) will open with the world premiere of thriller Tornado, with Pulp Fiction actor Roth set to be joined by Scottish director John Maclean and Japanese co-stars Koki and Takehiro Hira.

She added: \"Everyone across Glasgow Film works very hard to make the magic happen and I cannot thank all my colleagues enough for their hard work, enthusiasm and sheer brilliance in making this not only a great festival to attend, but a friendly and supportive environment to work in. \"I shall be sad that this is my last festival as I've had so many magical moments over the years, but I know the great work we have done will ensure that audiences, filmmakers and industry colleagues will continue to support what I consider to be the best film festival in the world.\""

        "Headline": "Ozzy Osbourne has announced he will reunite with his Black Sabbath bandmates for one final performance later this year. But who is the rock singer and how did he rise to fame?",
        "Content": "Rock legend Ozzy Osbourne is set to take to the stage for one last performance. The 76-year-old, whose real name is John Michael Osbourne, will reunite with his Black Sabbath bandmates at Aston Villa's Villa Park for a gig that promises to be the \"greatest heavy metal show ever\". The all-day Back To The Beginning show will be the metal band's first performance together in 20 years, with original stars Osbourne, Tony Iommi, Terence 'Geezer' Butler and Bill Ward. The comeback marks the first major show Osbourne has done since he cancelled planned gigs in Europe and the UK back in 2023, saying at that time that he is no longer \"physically capable\" of performing. In 2020 the singer also revealed he has Parkinson's disease. The show, planned for 5 July, is the latest in a career that has spanned five decades and earned Osbourne the nickname The Prince Of Darkness. Who is Ozzy Osbourne? Born in Birmingham, Osbourne rose to fame as a founding member and lead singer of the band Black Sabbath. The band formed in 1968 and two years later released their self-titled debut album which included songs like The Wizard and Evil Woman. The group's follow-up album, Paranoid, included some of the band's most famous songs including War Pigs, Iron Man, Fairies Wear Boots and Paranoid. The record was a huge success, topping the charts in the UK and reaching no 12 in the US. Black Sabbath went on to become one of the most successful metal bands of all time, selling more than 75 million albums worldwide over the years. After being kicked out of the band in 1979 due to erratic behaviour and a drug problem, Osbourne went on to have success as a solo artist. His solo debut album Blizzard Of Ozz reached the top 10 in the UK, and in 2020 he achieved his highest-ever charting album with Ordinary Man, which featured collaborations with Elton John, Slash, Post Malone and Tom Morello. Family life and reality TV Away from music, Osbourne's personal life has been a key feature of his career. In 1970, he was introduced to Sharon Levy - who would later become his wife and manager, Sharon Osbourne. They went on to have three children - Aimee, Kelly and Jack Osbourne. The singer's marriage to Sharon hit the headlines numerous times over the years, including his four-year affair with a hairstylist and his attempt to strangle her while under the influence of drugs in 1989. The incident led to him going to rehab for three months. The family hit new heights of fame when they starred in the reality TV series The Osbournes. The show followed the family during their daily lives in Beverley Hills in Los Angeles, including Sharon's public battle with colon cancer and Ozzy's near-fatal quad bike crash in 2003. The Osbournes lasted from 2002 to 2005, winning an Emmy Award for outstanding reality programme. After appearing on the show, Jack and Kelly went on to have successful careers on their own, both presenting TV shows including Jack Osbourne: Adrenaline Junkie and Australia's Got Talent. In September 2023 the family revealed they were relaunching their podcast The Osbournes, also featuring their eldest daughter Aimee, after first releasing the show in 2018. Substance abuse and health troubles Osbourne has regularly spoken publicly about his problems with drugs and alcohol and his time in rehab. The singer told Variety in 2021 that he had experienced drugs from a \"very early age\" adding that he felt \"lucky\" to have survived. \"There's nothing special about me. I should have been dead 1,000 times. I'm not being big-headed about that, or invincible. It doesn't take much to kill you,\" he said. The couple's youngest children Kelly and Jack also suffered with addiction, both going to rehab. In 2020, after cancelling various tour dates, the singer revealed he had been diagnosed with PRKN 2, a form of Parkinson's disease. He described the diagnosis as \"terribly challenging\" but said he was determined to get back on stage. \"I feel better now I've owned up to them [my fans] about having Parkinson's,\" he said at the time. \"To hide something is hard - you never feel proper. You feel guilty. I'm no good with secrets. I cannot walk around with it anymore. It's like I'm running out of excuses.\" The singer has also had extensive spinal surgery and other treatment, after a fall at home in 2019 aggravated injuries he suffered in the quad bike crash. In 2023 he said his body is \"still physically weak\", despite three operations, stem cell treatments, physical therapy sessions, and recent \"groundbreaking\" Cybernics (HAL) Treatment - using a wearable robot suit."
