        "Content": " Airlines have reacted furiously after a technical glitch in air traffic control systems led to more than 150 flight cancellations. The National Air Traffic Service (NATS) has apologised for the IT problems - and said systems were back up and running 20 minutes after the \"radar-related issue\" was detected at 4.05pm. But with thousands of passengers suffering extensive travel disruption, during one of the busiest times of the year, airline executives have warned this isn't good enough.  Ryanair's chief operating officer Neal McMahon has called for NATS chief executive Martin Rolfe to resign - and claimed Wednesday's incident was \"utterly unacceptable\". He said: \"It is outrageous that passengers are once again being hit with delays and disruption due to Martin Rolfe's continued mismanagement of NATS. \"It is clear that no lessons have been learnt since the August 2023 NATS system outage, and passengers continue to suffer as a result of Martin Rolfe's incompetence.\" Mr McMahon was referring to a glitch that affected more than 700,000 passengers two years ago - and said that, if Mr Rolfe refuses to step down, the government should intervene. \"Heidi Alexander must act without delay to remove Martin Rolfe and deliver urgent reform of NATS' shambolic ATC service, so that airlines and passengers are no longer forced to endure these preventable delays caused by persistent NATS failures,\" he added. The Department for Transport says Ms Alexander does not have any direct control over NATS - and no powers over staffing decisions at the service. EasyJet's chief operating officer David Morgan added: \"It's extremely disappointing to see an ATC failure once again causing disruption to our customers at this busy and important time of year for travel. \"While our priority today is supporting our customers, we will want to understand from NATS what steps they are taking to ensure issues don't continue.\" NATS is yet to comment on the calls for Mr Rolfe's resignation - but has stressed that the glitch is not believed to be \"cyber related\". \"This was a radar-related issue which was resolved by quickly switching to the back-up system during which time we reduced traffic to ensure safety,\" a spokesperson had said. Departures at airports across the country have now resumed - but passengers are being urged to check with their airline before heading to terminals.

We've got the wedding rehearsal to do. It's quite stressful.\" Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey called for an urgent investigation and also referred to the \"utterly unacceptable\" disruption two years earlier. \"With thousands of families preparing to go on a well-earned break, this just isn't good enough. The public deserve to have full confidence in such a vital piece of national infrastructure.\" Flights departing or arriving at a UK airport, or aircraft operated by a UK airline arriving in the EU, are subject to rules concerning delays or cancellations. Airlines may have to provide compensation, although there are exemptions for \"extraordinary circumstances\", according to the UK's Civil Aviation Authority."

        "Content": " Canada is planning to recognise a Palestinian state at the United Nations in September, the country's prime minister has said. Mark Carney's announcement comes a day after the UK said it will recognise Palestine as a state unless Israel meets several conditions. France became the first G7 country to announce the move last week - while Ireland, Spain and Norway all officially recognised a Palestinian state last year.  Mr Carney told reporters in Ontario that Canada would do the same on certain conditions - including that the Palestinian Authority commits to fundamentally reforming its governance, and holds general elections in 2026 in which Hamas can play no part. The Canadian prime minister said he had spoken with Mahmoud Abbas, the president of the Palestinian Authority, earlier in the day. Following the announcement, the Israeli foreign ministry said in a statement: \"The change in the position of the Canadian government at this time is a reward for Hamas and harms the efforts to achieve a ceasefire in Gaza and a framework for the release of the hostages.\" A White House official anonymously told Reuters that US President Donald Trump also believes he would be \"rewarding Hamas\" if he recognises a Palestinian state and therefore doesn't plan to do so. \"President Trump's focus is on getting people fed,\" the official added.  Canada had long stated it would only recognise a Palestinian state at the conclusion of peace talks with Israel. However, Mr Carney said the reality on the ground - including the starvation of citizens in Gaza - means \"the prospect of a Palestinian state is literally receding before our eyes\". He added: \"We are working ourselves, with others, to preserve the possibility of a two-state solution, to not allow the facts on the ground, deaths on the ground, the settlements on the ground, the expropriations on the ground, to get to such an extent that this is not possible.\" The Canadian prime minister also said he \"condemns the fact Israel has allowed a catastrophe to unfold in Gaza\". Read more:What does recognising a Palestinian state mean?Children 'eating out of piles of garbage' in Gaza Sir Keir Starmer announced the UK could recognise a Palestinian state after he had a meeting with Mr Trump the previous day. Sir Keir said the conditions Israel would have to meet to avoid such a move included taking substantive steps to end the \"appalling situation in Gaza\", and agreeing to a ceasefire. Some 38 members of the House of Lords, including some of the UK's most eminent lawyers, have since written to the attorney general to say that recognising a Palestinian state could be a breach of international law, The Times has reported. They have said the territory may not meet the criteria for statehood under the Montevideo Convention, a treaty signed in 1933.  Meanwhile, a Downing Street spokesperson confirmed Sir Keir had spoken to Mr Carney over the phone on Tuesday. The spokesperson said: \"They discussed the grave situation in the Middle East and last night's action by the United States to tackle the severe threat posed by Iran's nuclear programme. \"Both reiterated their support for a diplomatic solution and agreed that Iran must come back to the negotiating table with the United States as soon as possible. \"They looked forward to continuing their discussions at NATO this week.\" Gaza's humanitarian crisis A global hunger monitor has warned that a worst-case scenario of famine is unfolding in Gaza. The Hamas-run health ministry reported seven more hunger-related deaths on Wednesday, including a two-year-old girl with an existing health condition. Meanwhile, at least 48 Palestinians were killed and dozens were wounded while waiting for food at the Zikim Crossing, the main entry point for humanitarian aid to northern Gaza, according to the Shifa Hospital that received the casualties. It was not immediately clear who opened fire and there was no immediate comment from the Israeli military, which controls the crossing.  Israeli strikes and gunfire had earlier killed at least 46 Palestinians overnight and into Wednesday, most of them among crowds seeking food, health officials said. The Israeli military did not immediately comment on any of the strikes. It says it only targets militants and blames civilian deaths on Hamas, because the group's militants operate in densely populated areas. US special envoy Steve Witkoff will travel to Israel on Thursday to discuss the next steps to address the situation in Gaza, an American official said."

        "Content": "A dentist has been jailed for life for poisoning his wife's protein shakes before delivering a fatal dose of cyanide while she was in hospital. James Craig, from Colorado in the US, had searched on the internet \"how to make murder look like a heart attack\" weeks before Angela - his wife of 23 years - died, a trial heard. The 45-year-old had also searched for answers to the question \"is arsenic detectable in an autopsy?\" on a computer at his dental practice in the Denver suburb of Aurora in Colorado, the court was told. Prosecutors said the dentist had poisoned Mrs Craig, who was the mother of his six children, over 10 days in the month of her death. When those attempts failed, prosecutors alleged the dentist gave the 43-year-old a final dose of cyanide while she was hospitalised in Denver with symptoms that confused doctors. She was declared brain dead soon after on what was her third trip to hospital following the initial poisonings. Police in the Denver had begun investigating Craig after his dental practice partner and friend told a nurse that the dentist had ordered potassium cyanide, even though it was not needed for their work. \n                  US Federal Reserve defies calls from Donald Trump to cut interest rate\n                 \n                  Trump claims Epstein 'stole' Prince Andrew accuser Virginia Giuffre from his Mar-a-Lago resort\n                 \n                  Sean 'Diddy' Combs asks judge to release him on $50m bond as he awaits sentencing\n                 Craig was convicted of first-degree murder and several other charges by a jury at the Arapahoe County Justice Center on Wednesday. District Judge Shay Whitaker sentenced Craig to life without the possibility of parole, the mandatory sentence for a first-degree murder conviction in Colorado. The jury rejected his claim that he had helped his wife kill herself after he said he wanted a divorce following his repeated extramarital affairs. His sentencing came after his oldest daughter, Miriam Merservy, spoke tearfully in court about how she missed being able to talk to her mother about her life and how she felt betrayed by her father. \"I was supposed to be able to trust my dad; he was supposed to be my hero, and instead he'll forever be the villain in my book,\" she said. Craig appeared to shake with tears as his daughter spoke. The couple's son Toliver Craig told the court he and his mother didn't always get along - but two weeks after she died he set an alarm on his phone that still goes off every night at 10pm. It just says \"Mom\". \"I'm sad there's not more time with her,\" he said. Craig didn't testify during his two-week trial and he declined to make a statement before being sentenced. Toxicology tests determined Mrs Craig died of poisoning from cyanide and tetrahydrozoline, an ingredient commonly found in over-the-counter eye drops, according to the coroner. Read more US news:Diddy asks judge to release him on $50m bondUS Federal Reserve defies calls from Trump to cut interest rate Prosecutors argued Craig wanted to kill his wife to get out of a marriage he felt trapped in, adding he didn't want a divorce because he wanted to protect his money and image. They said photos from a hospital security camera shown in court depict Craig holding a syringe before he entered his wife's room. After administering the fatal dose, Craig walked out and texted a fellow dentist with whom he was having an affair, Senior Chief Deputy District Attorney Michael Mauro told jurors in closing arguments on Tuesday. His wife's condition quickly worsened. Speaking after sentencing, Mr Mauro said Craig clearly wanted out of his marriage but gave in to \"greed and cowardice\" with murder. \"The jury said it loudly: Angela was not suicidal. She had no knowledge of or participation in what happened to her,\" the prosecutor said. What else was Craig convicted of? Besides murder, Craig was found guilty of trying to cover up the killing by asking others to fake evidence and testimony that would make it appear his wife had killed herself or wanted to frame him for her death. He was also found guilty of asking one of his daughters, who was not Ms Merservy, to make a fake video of her mother asking to be poisoned. Craig was also convicted trying to get a fellow jail inmate to kill the lead detective investigating his wife's death. He was acquitted of just one charge - manslaughter."

        "Content": " A man has been found guilty of assaulting two female police officers at Manchester Airport last year.  Mohammed Fahir Amaaz punched PC Lydia Ward in the face, knocking her down and breaking her nose. The 20-year-old was also convicted of assaulting PC Ellie Cook and the earlier assault of a member of the public at an airport Starbucks. The jury was unable to decide whether Amaaz and his brother, Muhammad Amaad, 26, also assaulted a male officer. The incident happened at a car park pay area on 23 July 2024 after the brothers went to collect their mother from a flight. Police were called after Amaaz went into Starbucks and headbutted Abdulkareem Ismaeil - who he claimed racially abused his mother on the plane. The brothers resisted when officers tried to detain them and told the court they didn't know they were being approached by police. Prosecutors said Amaaz threw 10 punches, two elbow strikes and a kick, while Amaad aimed six blows at firearms officer PC Zachary Marsden. Amaaz told the trial he feared the \"lunatic\" male officer would \"batter him to death\" and Amaad said he believed he was under attack. Footage of a kick and stamp by PC Marsden on Amaaz was widely shared on social media in the days after the incident. The brothers - from Rochdale - denied all the charges and said they acted in self defence. Their lawyers said police had used \"unlawful force\", grabbing Amaaz from behind without identifying themselves. But jurors at Liverpool Crown Court disagreed and found Amaaz guilty of actual bodily harm to PC Ward, as well assaulting PC Cook and Mr Ismaeil.

Sir Stephen said 44 of his officers are assaulted every week. \"Our officers are decent people who routinely place themselves in harm's way to protect the public. They deserve our respect and support,\" he said."

        "Content": "\n          Science and technology editor\n              @t0mclark3\n  As earthquakes go, this was a monster. At 8.8 on the magnitude scale, it's up there with the most powerful ever recorded. It's also one that some seismologists were anticipating. Wednesday's quake, in Russia's Far East, occurred on a fault line running along the Kuril-Kamchatka Trench - a scar on the seabed caused by the Pacific tectonic plate diving beneath the North American and Okhotsk plates. Called a subduction zone, it's one of a series around the Pacific's notorious \"Ring of Fire\". The friction from shifting plates fuels volcanoes but is also notorious for causing \"megathrust\" earthquakes and resulting tsunamis. The last major earthquake on the Kamchatka peninsula was in 1952, just 30km (18 miles) from this latest quake's epicentre. The US Geological Survey estimates that six metres-worth of tectonic movement had built up along the Kuril-Kamchatka Trench since then. \n                  Authoritarian states operating without impunity to silence dissidents in UK, report finds\n                 \n                  Has Trump broken from Netanyahu over Gaza?\n                 \n                  Five killed after Russia and Ukraine trade aerial bombardments\n                 A series of \"foreshocks,\" including a 7.4 magnitude earthquake on 20 July, suggested those seven decades of stress were being transferred along the fault, indicating a major quake near the 1952 epicentre may have been imminent. But the moment an earthquake strikes is always impossible to predict, so too is the size or spread of a resulting tsunami. A massive earthquake doesn't always correspond to a massive tsunami.  Read more:What we know about Russia earthquakeWhat are the strongest ever quakes? A host of factors, including the amount of movement on the sea floor, the area over which the movement spreads, and the depth of the ocean above, all play a role. From the limited information so far, even in areas close to the epicentre, the tsunami waves were sustained, but nowhere near as large as the one that struck Japan in 2011. The 9.1 magnitude earthquake that caused the Tohoku tsunami generated a wave nearly 40 metres high in places. The combined impacts of the earthquake and tsunami claimed nearly 20,000 lives. According to the Kremlin, no fatalities have been reported in Russia so far.  It's a very sparsely populated area, meaning casualties will almost certainly be lower than in comparable-sized quakes in Japan and Indonesia. It's also possible that the foreshocks that preceded the Kamchatka quake may have helped save lives. Following the 20 July earthquake in Kamchatka, local tsunami alerts warned people to head to higher ground. When this latest quake struck, with more than 10 times more power than the last, people may have acted even before the warnings came."

        "Content": "\n          Culture and entertainment reporter\n              @gemmapeplow\n  Ozzy Osbourne has taken his final tour of Birmingham - with his family experiencing the love of thousands of fans who turned out to see the heavy metal star come home. \"We love you, Ozzy!\" came the shouts from the crowd as his cortege stopped at Black Sabbath Bridge in the city, a site that has become a shrine to the performer since his death at 76 last week. His family and loved ones, including his wife Sharon Osbourne and their children Jack, Kelly and Aimee, spent several minutes taking in all the flowers, messages and other tributes left in an outpouring of love from fans. Sharon was in tears as she took it all in. Supported by her children, she gave a peace sign to the crowd before returning to the procession vehicles. Each family member carried a pink rose, wrapped in black paper, tied with a purple ribbon - the traditional Black Sabbath colours. The flowers bearing his name in the hearse were also purple. Before reaching the city centre, the cortege had travelled past Ozzy's childhood home in Aston. Just a few weeks ago, he was on stage at Villa Park performing his final gig alongside many of the musicians his music had inspired, from Metallica to Guns N' Roses to Yungblud. Heavy metal, reality TV and biting bats: Ozzy Osbourne obituary On a hugely emotional day, his presence could be felt throughout the city, with the star's music playing in pubs and posters paying tribute: \"Birmingham will always love you.\" For fans, this was a chance to say not just goodbye, but also thank you to a star who never forgot where he came from. His remarkable achievements from humble beginnings and continued love for his hometown, even when he lived thousands of miles away in Los Angeles, meant that for many, the loss feels incredibly personal. 'The Prince of Laughter - not Darkness' Graham Wright, a roadie who worked with Black Sabbath in the 1970s and beyond, up to the Back To The Beginning reunion gig at Villa Park, told Sky News he would remember Ozzy not by his traditional nickname, the Prince of Darkness - but as the Prince of Laughter instead. \"It was a shock he left us so soon after [the show],\" he said. \"The show was tough for him but he was determined to say goodbye to his fans, that was the main thing. It was important for all four of [Black Sabbath] to get back together and do a farewell. \"The tears will be flowing today to see the Ozz man - the Prince of Laughter, not Darkness. He really was. We'll all miss him.\" 'My mum used to say he was a lovely boy' Chris Mason, general manager of The Brasshouse pub, which is next to Black Sabbath Bridge, said music by the band and Ozzy's solo material had been played pretty much \"on loop\" since his death. \"I'm a metal fan and Ozzy being the godfather of the scene - if not for Ozzy and Black Sabbath, we wouldn't have heavy metal,\" he said. \"This is what Birmingham is about, bringing people together, and Ozzy and Black Sabbath did that. \"He was Mr Birmingham and his family have brought him back.\" Mohabbat Ali, who used to live on the same street as Ozzy's childhood home, said the property had become one of the focal points for tributes in the city. Describing what it was like living near him, he said: \"He played guitars, very loud at night sometimes, but my mum used to say he was a lovely boy.\" Arts and entertainment correspondent The sea of black was always a given â but this wasnât about respecting funeral traditions. Ozzy himself had previously said he wanted his send-off, when it came, to be a celebration and not a \"mope-fest\". This was his final tour in the city that meant so much to him. For fans, he meant so much to them. For his family, the emotion was raw.\nSharon, his soulmate, has spent her life and career organising his shows, and it was clear how hard this day was for her.  After they left, fans flooded the streets to lay flowers. Not since David Bowie has an artist's death prompted such an outpouring of emotion. From an era of preening rock gods, Ozzy was the real deal -  one of the most notorious figures in rock, but a man who remained as Brummie as can be. 'A true legend who never forgot his roots' Birmingham's lord mayor, Councillor Zafar Iqbal, also attended the procession and spoke of the city's pride in Ozzy. \"What a great honour for us to have him here one last time,\" he said. \"The love for Ozzy - well, you can feel it in the air.\" The star put both Aston and Birmingham on the map, he said, and always took the time to get to know people. Mr Iqbal said Ozzy sent him a letter after reading on the mayor's website biography how he had struggled with dyslexia at school - something the star identified with. \"I've got the letter in a frame and it's in my office... he was just a natural human being, down to earth. You wouldn't have known he was a rock star - but he was a true legend, who never forgot his roots.\""

When taking questions, Mr Trump said: \"I'd love him to lower interest rates,\" then laughed and slapped Powell's arm. The US president also challenged him, in front of reporters, about an alleged overspend on the renovations and produced paperwork to prove his point. Mr Powell shook his head as Trump made the claim. When Mr Trump was asked what he would do as a real estate mogul if this happened to one of his projects, he said he'd fire his project manager - seemingly in reference to Mr Powell. Unlike the UK, the US interest rate is a range to guide lenders rather than a single percentage. The Fed has expressed concern about the impact of Mr Trump's signature economic policy of implementing new tariffs, taxes on imports to the US.  On Wednesday, the president said he was still negotiating with India on trade after announcing the US will impose a 25% tariff on goods imported from the country from Friday. Mr Trump also signed an executive order on Wednesday implementing an additional 40% tariff on Brazil, bringing the total tariff amount to 50%, excluding certain products, including oil and precious metals.

In a policy statement to explain their decision, the Federal Reserve said that \"uncertainty about the economic outlook remains elevated\" but growth \"moderated in the first half of the year,\" possibly bolstering the case to lower rates at a future meeting. Nathan Thooft, chief investment officer at Manulife Investment Management, described the rate decision as a \"kind of a nothing burger\" and it was \"widely expected\". Tony Welch, chief investment officer at SignatureFD, agreed that it was \"broadly as expected\". He added: \"That explains why you're not seeing a lot of movement in the market right now because there's nothing that's surprising.\""

        "Content": " A woman who stabbed her ex-partner in the heart on Christmas Day after seeing his Tinder profile has been found guilty of his murder.Â  Kirsty Carless, 33, plunged a knife into the heart of 31-year-old Louis Price in the early hours of 25 December 2024, in an attack \"motivated by anger and jealousy and fuelled by cocaine and alcohol,\" after a friend sent her a picture of his Tinder profile, Stafford Crown Court heard. Carless had been on police bail for strangling Price the month before. After about a day of deliberations on Wednesday, a jury of seven men and five women found her guilty of murder and possession of an offensive weapon by unanimous verdicts regarding the fatal stabbing. Carless was also found guilty of assault occasioning actual bodily harm in connection with an incident in November 2024. She was cleared of intentional strangulation in relation to the same incident. Carless, of Cannock, Staffordshire, had been at the pub drinking double vodka and cokes with a male friend on Christmas Eve, the trial was told. She had sex with the male three times at his home before a female friend sent her a screenshot of Price's Tinder profile at around 1.30am on Christmas Day, which the court heard made her angry. Carless took a taxi back to her house, picked up a kitchen knife, and got another taxi to Mr Price's parents' home in Norton Canes, where she expected to find him with a woman. CCTV footage captured her sprinting up the front path into the house and then following him through the garden, before he was later discovered with a single stab wound to the chest on the conservatory floor. Carless made 45 calls to Price between 2.15am and 2.44am while waiting for a taxi. She only briefly paused what the prosecution described as a \"barrage\" of calls to contact the taxi company and check on its arrival. After arriving at the address around 3am, Carless asked the taxi driver to wait outside while she went into the property. The taxi driver reported that about 30 seconds after Carless entered the property with a key, he heard a \"very loud and prolonged\" scream. Carless was \"anxious and sweating\" as she got back into the taxi less than two minutes after arriving. She asked the driver to take her to her parents' home, where she confessed to what she had done, and the police were called.

During this incident, Price called 999 to say Carless had poured bleach over expensive tracksuits, after putting them in the bin, had thrown a glass candle holder at him, pulled him down the stairs, and choked him. Police body-worn camera footage showed him in tears, telling an officer, \"It's f****** embarrassingâ¦ this can't keep happening, man.\" In a witness statement following the incident, he described the relationship, which began in 2021, as \"generally abusive,\" saying she prevented him from doing activities he enjoyed, like playing football, and had physically assaulted him. Police were also called to several previous incidents, including one in March 2023, when Carless claimed that Price had punched her and had been violent. He was arrested, but Carless later retracted her statement. On another occasion, a neighbour recalled seeing Carless strike Price in the ribs with a metal pole outside her house. In her testimony at the trial, Carless said she had no memory of stabbing Price, insisted she was \"not a violent person,\" and stated she had only gone to his address because she believed he had taken money from a card she kept at her home. Carless stated that she grabbed a knife to destroy the caravan where he was staying in his parents' backyard, that she \"panicked\" after stabbing him, and then fled. Judge Justice Choudhury said Carless would be sentenced on Thursday."

        "Content": " Airlines have reacted furiously after a technical glitch in air traffic control systems led to more than 150 flight cancellations. The National Air Traffic Service (NATS) has apologised for the IT problems - and said systems were back up and running 20 minutes after the \"radar-related issue\" was detected at 4.05pm. But with thousands of passengers suffering extensive travel disruption, during one of the busiest times of the year, airline executives have warned this isn't good enough.  Ryanair's chief operating officer Neal McMahon has called for NATS chief executive Martin Rolfe to resign - and claimed Wednesday's incident was \"utterly unacceptable\". He said: \"It is outrageous that passengers are once again being hit with delays and disruption due to Martin Rolfe's continued mismanagement of NATS. \"It is clear that no lessons have been learnt since the August 2023 NATS system outage, and passengers continue to suffer as a result of Martin Rolfe's incompetence.\" Mr McMahon was referring to a glitch that affected more than 700,000 passengers two years ago - and said that, if Mr Rolfe refuses to step down, the government should intervene. \"Heidi Alexander must act without delay to remove Martin Rolfe and deliver urgent reform of NATS' shambolic ATC service, so that airlines and passengers are no longer forced to endure these preventable delays caused by persistent NATS failures,\" he added. The Department for Transport says Ms Alexander does not have any direct control over NATS - and no powers over staffing decisions at the service. EasyJet's chief operating officer David Morgan added: \"It's extremely disappointing to see an ATC failure once again causing disruption to our customers at this busy and important time of year for travel. \"While our priority today is supporting our customers, we will want to understand from NATS what steps they are taking to ensure issues don't continue.\" NATS is yet to comment on the calls for Mr Rolfe's resignation - but has stressed that the glitch is not believed to be \"cyber related\". \"This was a radar-related issue which was resolved by quickly switching to the back-up system during which time we reduced traffic to ensure safety,\" a spokesperson had said. Departures at airports across the country have now resumed - but passengers are being urged to check with their airline before heading to terminals.

We've got the wedding rehearsal to do. It's quite stressful.\" Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey called for an urgent investigation and also referred to the \"utterly unacceptable\" disruption two years earlier. \"With thousands of families preparing to go on a well-earned break, this just isn't good enough. The public deserve to have full confidence in such a vital piece of national infrastructure.\" Flights departing or arriving at a UK airport, or aircraft operated by a UK airline arriving in the EU, are subject to rules concerning delays or cancellations. Airlines may have to provide compensation, although there are exemptions for \"extraordinary circumstances\", according to the UK's Civil Aviation Authority."

        "Content": " A man has been found guilty of assaulting two female police officers at Manchester Airport last year.  Mohammed Fahir Amaaz punched PC Lydia Ward in the face, knocking her down and breaking her nose. The 20-year-old was also convicted of assaulting PC Ellie Cook and the earlier assault of a member of the public at an airport Starbucks. The jury was unable to decide whether Amaaz and his brother, Muhammad Amaad, 26, also assaulted a male officer. The incident happened at a car park pay area on 23 July 2024 after the brothers went to collect their mother from a flight. Police were called after Amaaz went into Starbucks and headbutted Abdulkareem Ismaeil - who he claimed racially abused his mother on the plane. The brothers resisted when officers tried to detain them and told the court they didn't know they were being approached by police. Prosecutors said Amaaz threw 10 punches, two elbow strikes and a kick, while Amaad aimed six blows at firearms officer PC Zachary Marsden. Amaaz told the trial he feared the \"lunatic\" male officer would \"batter him to death\" and Amaad said he believed he was under attack. Footage of a kick and stamp by PC Marsden on Amaaz was widely shared on social media in the days after the incident. The brothers - from Rochdale - denied all the charges and said they acted in self defence. Their lawyers said police had used \"unlawful force\", grabbing Amaaz from behind without identifying themselves. But jurors at Liverpool Crown Court disagreed and found Amaaz guilty of actual bodily harm to PC Ward, as well assaulting PC Cook and Mr Ismaeil.

Sir Stephen said 44 of his officers are assaulted every week. \"Our officers are decent people who routinely place themselves in harm's way to protect the public. They deserve our respect and support,\" he said."

        "Content": "\n          Culture and entertainment reporter\n              @gemmapeplow\n  Ozzy Osbourne has taken his final tour of Birmingham - with his family experiencing the love of thousands of fans who turned out to see the heavy metal star come home. \"We love you, Ozzy!\" came the shouts from the crowd as his cortege stopped at Black Sabbath Bridge in the city, a site that has become a shrine to the performer since his death at 76 last week. His family and loved ones, including his wife Sharon Osbourne and their children Jack, Kelly and Aimee, spent several minutes taking in all the flowers, messages and other tributes left in an outpouring of love from fans. Sharon was in tears as she took it all in. Supported by her children, she gave a peace sign to the crowd before returning to the procession vehicles. Each family member carried a pink rose, wrapped in black paper, tied with a purple ribbon - the traditional Black Sabbath colours. The flowers bearing his name in the hearse were also purple. Before reaching the city centre, the cortege had travelled past Ozzy's childhood home in Aston. Just a few weeks ago, he was on stage at Villa Park performing his final gig alongside many of the musicians his music had inspired, from Metallica to Guns N' Roses to Yungblud. Heavy metal, reality TV and biting bats: Ozzy Osbourne obituary On a hugely emotional day, his presence could be felt throughout the city, with the star's music playing in pubs and posters paying tribute: \"Birmingham will always love you.\" For fans, this was a chance to say not just goodbye, but also thank you to a star who never forgot where he came from. His remarkable achievements from humble beginnings and continued love for his hometown, even when he lived thousands of miles away in Los Angeles, meant that for many, the loss feels incredibly personal. 'The Prince of Laughter - not Darkness' Graham Wright, a roadie who worked with Black Sabbath in the 1970s and beyond, up to the Back To The Beginning reunion gig at Villa Park, told Sky News he would remember Ozzy not by his traditional nickname, the Prince of Darkness - but as the Prince of Laughter instead. \"It was a shock he left us so soon after [the show],\" he said. \"The show was tough for him but he was determined to say goodbye to his fans, that was the main thing. It was important for all four of [Black Sabbath] to get back together and do a farewell. \"The tears will be flowing today to see the Ozz man - the Prince of Laughter, not Darkness. He really was. We'll all miss him.\" 'My mum used to say he was a lovely boy' Chris Mason, general manager of The Brasshouse pub, which is next to Black Sabbath Bridge, said music by the band and Ozzy's solo material had been played pretty much \"on loop\" since his death. \"I'm a metal fan and Ozzy being the godfather of the scene - if not for Ozzy and Black Sabbath, we wouldn't have heavy metal,\" he said. \"This is what Birmingham is about, bringing people together, and Ozzy and Black Sabbath did that. \"He was Mr Birmingham and his family have brought him back.\" Mohabbat Ali, who used to live on the same street as Ozzy's childhood home, said the property had become one of the focal points for tributes in the city. Describing what it was like living near him, he said: \"He played guitars, very loud at night sometimes, but my mum used to say he was a lovely boy.\" Arts and entertainment correspondent The sea of black was always a given â but this wasnât about respecting funeral traditions. Ozzy himself had previously said he wanted his send-off, when it came, to be a celebration and not a \"mope-fest\". This was his final tour in the city that meant so much to him. For fans, he meant so much to them. For his family, the emotion was raw.\nSharon, his soulmate, has spent her life and career organising his shows, and it was clear how hard this day was for her.  After they left, fans flooded the streets to lay flowers. Not since David Bowie has an artist's death prompted such an outpouring of emotion. From an era of preening rock gods, Ozzy was the real deal -  one of the most notorious figures in rock, but a man who remained as Brummie as can be. 'A true legend who never forgot his roots' Birmingham's lord mayor, Councillor Zafar Iqbal, also attended the procession and spoke of the city's pride in Ozzy. \"What a great honour for us to have him here one last time,\" he said. \"The love for Ozzy - well, you can feel it in the air.\" The star put both Aston and Birmingham on the map, he said, and always took the time to get to know people. Mr Iqbal said Ozzy sent him a letter after reading on the mayor's website biography how he had struggled with dyslexia at school - something the star identified with. \"I've got the letter in a frame and it's in my office... he was just a natural human being, down to earth. You wouldn't have known he was a rock star - but he was a true legend, who never forgot his roots.\""

        "Content": "By Faye Brown, political reporter  Protests at a hotel in Essex housing asylum seekers \"is a crisis that risks boiling over\", the local MP has said as pressure builds on the home secretary to close it down. Neil Hudson, the Conservative MP for Epping Forest, has signed a letter along with other local politicians urging Home Secretary Yvette Cooper to make The Bell Hotel a priority for urgent decommissioning. Mr Hudson told Sky News that protests at the site have led to \"deeply troubling and unsettling\" scenes, with people coming from outside the area \"not to support the real concerns of our local community, but to disrupt and cause violence\". He said: \"This is a crisis that risks boiling over, and for the safety of our community, the government must get a grip on this situation now, and they must listen and act quickly to close the hotel.\" The letter to the home secretary, which requests an urgent meeting, was also signed by neighbouring Conservative MP Alex Burghart, Epping Forest District Council leader Christopher Whitbread, leader of Essex County Council Kevin Bentley, and Police, Fire and Crime Commissioner for Essex Roger Hirst. It also expresses concerns about the use of the Phoenix Hotel in North Weald, in Mr Burghart's Brentwood and Ongar constituency, to house asylum seekers, which has been subject to alleged arson attacks. The letter said the sites are \"proving to be entirely unsuitable\" and \"placing an unsustainable strain on police resources\". \n                  How is Starmer's government doing? Here's what 'end-of-term' report from voters says \n                 \n                  Wes Streeting rules out pay rises for striking resident doctors saying they have 'squandered goodwill'\n                 \n                  Companies who pay suppliers late to be fined\n                 They added that this is \"creating significant community tension, and leading to public disorder that is unacceptable to our residents and deeply concerning for the safety of all involved\". Multiple demonstrations have been held outside The Bell since 13 July after an asylum seeker was charged with allegedly attempting to kiss a 14-year-old girl. Hadush Gerberslasie Kebatu, 38, who was charged with sexual assault, denies the allegations. He is due to stand trial in August. Since the disorder broke out, Essex Police said 14 people have been charged in connection with the protests and there have been 23 arrests, while eight officers have been injured. One of the injured officers required hospitalisation \"after being struck in the face with a bottle\", the letter from the authorities said. It said that \"large-scale protests and counter-protests\" have attracted more than 2,000 people on some days and deploying police to the demonstrations is \"putting our ability to maintain public safety at risk\". \"We support the Home Office's wider objective of reducing reliance on hotels and are keen to work with you. However, we urge you to accelerate this process and make The Bell Hotel in Epping a priority for urgent closure,\" the letter added. Chancellor Rachel Reeves said last month that the government would close all asylum seeker hotels by the end of this parliament but with record numbers still crossing the Channel, it is not clear how this will be achieved or where those awaiting a decision will go.  As Sky's home editor Jason Farrell reports, tensions have also flared in Altrincham near Manchester, where a hotel has been repurposed to house asylum seekers. Last week, Business Secretary Jonathan Reynolds told Sky News he \"gets the public's frustration\" over asylum hotels.  The government has since announced that asylum seekers will face homelessness if they refuse to move out of hotels, as part of their plans to reduce their use. However, it is not clear if they have immediate plans to shut down The Bell. Last week, after Epping council voted to urge the government to shut the hotel, a spokesperson said: \"We'll continue to work closely with local police and community partners, in Epping and across the country, as we fix this broken system.\" Sky News has contacted the Home Office for further comment."

Prosecutors said he returned to the scene, put on the face covering and stabbed the father-of-two. A struggle spilled out into the street and members of the public tried to help Mr McKay, but he couldn't be saved. The court heard Belle then headed to Parker's address to take a shower and get rid of evidence. However, he was arrested two days later following a manhunt. \n                  Father and son named as victims in central London stabbing\n                 \n                  Five boys arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after 14-year-old stabbed in Newham\n                 \n                  Man arrested on suspicion of murder after stabbing at London business\n                 Traces of blood and the black sliders Belle wore for the murder were found when police pulled over Parker's car, despite her attempts to clean up the vehicle. Officers also found a YouTube video showing Belle threatening Mr McKay - who ran an enterprise helping young people leaving care get jobs and homes. The court heard he'd also helped Belle but his killer became angry and jealous when he refused to pay for a rap video. Mr McKay's mother, Bash Kehinde, said her son had helped more than 50 young men and had taken in Belle after he left prison, giving him clothes and a place to stay. Addressing him in court, she said: \"You then asked Josh for more, you wanted him to fund your rap video. \"Josh told you he wouldn't give you the money - Â£1,500 - that if you were serious about being a rapper then you would work hard to make your video.\" She said he became angry with her son - who ignored his threats. Ms Kehinde added: \"While you would have seen Josh as being successful, having money to buy a flash car and fancy clothes - what you would never realise is that they were the rewards of hard work and dedication to others.\" Belle, from Edmonton, was sentenced on Wednesday to a minimum of 28 years after being found guilty of murder and knife possession last month. His ex-girlfriend Tenika Parker, a 39-year-old primary school teacher, was found guilty of perverting the course of justice and knife possession. She was jailed for two years and three months. Daniel Cooper, 22, who provided the weapon and balaclava, pleaded guilty to possessing a blade and was jailed for 30 weeks on a previous occasion. Speaking outside court, Mr McKay's mother described him as a \"beautiful, happy, kind, man, and an active, loving father\".

After her release, she told Sir Keir in a phone call she was detained in a United Nations facility but denied medical treatment during her captivity. She also underwent a series of operations for wounds she suffered on the day she was taken captive, when she was shot in her left hand and right leg at close range, causing her to lose two fingers and leaving her with injuries to her leg that impair her movement.

        "Content": " Canada is planning to recognise a Palestinian state at the United Nations in September, the country's prime minister has said. Mark Carney's announcement comes a day after the UK said it will recognise Palestine as a state unless Israel meets several conditions. France became the first G7 country to announce the move last week - while Ireland, Spain and Norway all officially recognised a Palestinian state last year.  Mr Carney told reporters in Ontario that Canada would do the same on certain conditions - including that the Palestinian Authority commits to fundamentally reforming its governance, and holds general elections in 2026 in which Hamas can play no part. The Canadian prime minister said he had spoken with Mahmoud Abbas, the president of the Palestinian Authority, earlier in the day. Following the announcement, the Israeli foreign ministry said in a statement: \"The change in the position of the Canadian government at this time is a reward for Hamas and harms the efforts to achieve a ceasefire in Gaza and a framework for the release of the hostages.\" A White House official anonymously told Reuters that US President Donald Trump also believes he would be \"rewarding Hamas\" if he recognises a Palestinian state and therefore doesn't plan to do so. \"President Trump's focus is on getting people fed,\" the official added.  Canada had long stated it would only recognise a Palestinian state at the conclusion of peace talks with Israel. However, Mr Carney said the reality on the ground - including the starvation of citizens in Gaza - means \"the prospect of a Palestinian state is literally receding before our eyes\". He added: \"We are working ourselves, with others, to preserve the possibility of a two-state solution, to not allow the facts on the ground, deaths on the ground, the settlements on the ground, the expropriations on the ground, to get to such an extent that this is not possible.\" The Canadian prime minister also said he \"condemns the fact Israel has allowed a catastrophe to unfold in Gaza\". Read more:What does recognising a Palestinian state mean?Children 'eating out of piles of garbage' in Gaza Sir Keir Starmer announced the UK could recognise a Palestinian state after he had a meeting with Mr Trump the previous day. Sir Keir said the conditions Israel would have to meet to avoid such a move included taking substantive steps to end the \"appalling situation in Gaza\", and agreeing to a ceasefire. Some 38 members of the House of Lords, including some of the UK's most eminent lawyers, have since written to the attorney general to say that recognising a Palestinian state could be a breach of international law, The Times has reported. They have said the territory may not meet the criteria for statehood under the Montevideo Convention, a treaty signed in 1933.  Meanwhile, a Downing Street spokesperson confirmed Sir Keir had spoken to Mr Carney over the phone on Tuesday. The spokesperson said: \"They discussed the grave situation in the Middle East and last night's action by the United States to tackle the severe threat posed by Iran's nuclear programme. \"Both reiterated their support for a diplomatic solution and agreed that Iran must come back to the negotiating table with the United States as soon as possible. \"They looked forward to continuing their discussions at NATO this week.\" Gaza's humanitarian crisis A global hunger monitor has warned that a worst-case scenario of famine is unfolding in Gaza. The Hamas-run health ministry reported seven more hunger-related deaths on Wednesday, including a two-year-old girl with an existing health condition. Meanwhile, at least 48 Palestinians were killed and dozens were wounded while waiting for food at the Zikim Crossing, the main entry point for humanitarian aid to northern Gaza, according to the Shifa Hospital that received the casualties. It was not immediately clear who opened fire and there was no immediate comment from the Israeli military, which controls the crossing.  Israeli strikes and gunfire had earlier killed at least 46 Palestinians overnight and into Wednesday, most of them among crowds seeking food, health officials said. The Israeli military did not immediately comment on any of the strikes. It says it only targets militants and blames civilian deaths on Hamas, because the group's militants operate in densely populated areas. US special envoy Steve Witkoff will travel to Israel on Thursday to discuss the next steps to address the situation in Gaza, an American official said."

        "Content": "A dentist has been jailed for life for poisoning his wife's protein shakes before delivering a fatal dose of cyanide while she was in hospital. James Craig, from Colorado in the US, had searched on the internet \"how to make murder look like a heart attack\" weeks before Angela - his wife of 23 years - died, a trial heard. The 45-year-old had also searched for answers to the question \"is arsenic detectable in an autopsy?\" on a computer at his dental practice in the Denver suburb of Aurora in Colorado, the court was told. Prosecutors said the dentist had poisoned Mrs Craig, who was the mother of his six children, over 10 days in the month of her death. When those attempts failed, prosecutors alleged the dentist gave the 43-year-old a final dose of cyanide while she was hospitalised in Denver with symptoms that confused doctors. She was declared brain dead soon after on what was her third trip to hospital following the initial poisonings. Police in the Denver had begun investigating Craig after his dental practice partner and friend told a nurse that the dentist had ordered potassium cyanide, even though it was not needed for their work. \n                  US Federal Reserve defies calls from Donald Trump to cut interest rate\n                 \n                  Trump claims Epstein 'stole' Prince Andrew accuser Virginia Giuffre from his Mar-a-Lago resort\n                 \n                  Sean 'Diddy' Combs asks judge to release him on $50m bond as he awaits sentencing\n                 Craig was convicted of first-degree murder and several other charges by a jury at the Arapahoe County Justice Center on Wednesday. District Judge Shay Whitaker sentenced Craig to life without the possibility of parole, the mandatory sentence for a first-degree murder conviction in Colorado. The jury rejected his claim that he had helped his wife kill herself after he said he wanted a divorce following his repeated extramarital affairs. His sentencing came after his oldest daughter, Miriam Merservy, spoke tearfully in court about how she missed being able to talk to her mother about her life and how she felt betrayed by her father. \"I was supposed to be able to trust my dad; he was supposed to be my hero, and instead he'll forever be the villain in my book,\" she said. Craig appeared to shake with tears as his daughter spoke. The couple's son Toliver Craig told the court he and his mother didn't always get along - but two weeks after she died he set an alarm on his phone that still goes off every night at 10pm. It just says \"Mom\". \"I'm sad there's not more time with her,\" he said. Craig didn't testify during his two-week trial and he declined to make a statement before being sentenced. Toxicology tests determined Mrs Craig died of poisoning from cyanide and tetrahydrozoline, an ingredient commonly found in over-the-counter eye drops, according to the coroner.

They said photos from a hospital security camera shown in court depict Craig holding a syringe before he entered his wife's room. After administering the fatal dose, Craig walked out and texted a fellow dentist with whom he was having an affair, Senior Chief Deputy District Attorney Michael Mauro told jurors in closing arguments on Tuesday. His wife's condition quickly worsened. Speaking after sentencing, Mr Mauro said Craig clearly wanted out of his marriage but gave in to \"greed and cowardice\" with murder. \"The jury said it loudly: Angela was not suicidal. She had no knowledge of or participation in what happened to her,\" the prosecutor said. What else was Craig convicted of? Besides murder, Craig was found guilty of trying to cover up the killing by asking others to fake evidence and testimony that would make it appear his wife had killed herself or wanted to frame him for her death. He was also found guilty of asking one of his daughters, who was not Ms Merservy, to make a fake video of her mother asking to be poisoned. Craig was also convicted trying to get a fellow jail inmate to kill the lead detective investigating his wife's death. He was acquitted of just one charge - manslaughter."

        "Content": " An earthquake off the Russian peninsula of Kamchatka has triggered tsunami warnings in Japan, China, Hawaii, the US and central and Latin America. The 8.8 magnitude earthquake occurred 12 miles below the surface of the water and around 80 miles southeast of the city of Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky, northeastern Russia on Wednesday, according to the US Geological Survey. Tsunami warnings latest So far, it's the most powerful on record since the 9.1 Japanese earthquake of 2011, which left more than 15,000 people dead, and the sixth strongest since records began. Tsunamis have reached land in Japan, Hawaii, and the US but initial fears they would prove deadly have not transpired. How did it start? The earthquake struck at shallow depth 80 miles southeast of Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky - a city of 165,000 people along the coast of Russia's Avacha Bay, at around 11.30am on Wednesday, local time (12.30am UK). Waves were recorded of up to 4m (13ft) in Severo-Kurilsk on the Kuril Islands. A state of emergency was declared on the Kamchatka Peninsula and the Kiril Islands but later cancelled. Russia's Tass news agency reported people running out into the streets, with balconies shaking, furniture and glass broken inside homes, and cars swaying on the street. Around 2,700 people were evacuated. Electricity cuts were also reported across the peninsula. Several people were injured and had to seek medical assistance, according to regional health minister Oleg Melnikov. \"Unfortunately, there are some people injured during the seismic event. Some were hurt while running outside, and one patient jumped out of a window. A woman was also injured inside the new airport terminal,\" he said. Where else have tsunamis hit so far? Injuries have been reported in several countries, but there are no known deaths so far. Many of the initial tsunami warnings have now been degraded. Beyond Russia, tsunami waves have hit land in Japan, Hawaii, and the US West Coast. Two million people have been evacuated along Japan's Pacific coast, with evacuation advisories in place in more than 220 municipalities, according to the Fire and Disaster Management Agency. Nuclear power plants have also paused activity. There were waves of 60cm (2ft) on the island of Hokkaido and 50cm (1.6ft) at Ishinomaki port in the north of the country. In northern Iwate, 40cm (1.3ft) waves were registered at Kuji port. The tsunami alert has been lowered for south of Fukushima but is still in place in the north. In Hawaii, people rushed to seek higher ground after waves measured 1.82m (6ft). Earthquake sirens blared in the streets, with beaches closed and coastal areas evacuated. Maui airport was also closed, Hawaii Governor Josh Green added. Evacuation orders were later lifted, with the Pacific Tsunami Warning Centre (PTWC) saying it was safe to return to coastal areas and Mr Green saying the island had \"not seen a wave of consequence\". In Alaska, 30cm (1ft) waves were observed in the communities of Amchitka and Adak, according to Dave Snider, tsunami warning coordinator.

In China, the country's tsunami warning centre has issued alerts for eastern coastal areas - particularly Shanghai and Zhejiang, which was already under alert from Typhoon CoMay, due to land on Wednesday. States along the US West Coast also issued tsunami advisories, including Oregon, Washington State, and California, where waves have already hit. Oregon's Department of Emergency Management cautioned: \"This is not a major tsunami, but dangerous currents and strong waves may pose a risk to those near the water.\" President Donald Trump posted on X: \"A Tsunami Watch is in effect for Alaska and the Pacific Coast of the United States. Japan is also in the way. Please visit tsunami.gov/ for the latest information. STAY STRONG AND STAY SAFE!\" The Mexican Navy said that tsunami waves were due to hit Mexico's northern coast at Ensenada near California, and could progress to Chiapas. In New Zealand, the country's disaster management agency issued warnings for coastal areas, which are likely to see \"strong and unusual currents and unpredictable surges at shore\". There is currently no need for official evacuation orders, it added, but people are being told to stay away from the coast. The Pacific Island nations of Fiji, Samoa, Tonga, Micronesia, and the Solomon Islands have all issued warnings, as their low-lying topography puts them at particular risk. The Philippines had a tsunami advisory in place but cancelled it after \"no significant sea level disturbances or destructive tsunami waves\" were reported after 7.25am local time (12.25am UK) on Wednesday. The 'Great Chilean' earthquake in Biobio, central Chile in 1960 is the most powerful on record, at a magnitude of 9.5. More than 1,600 people died and thousands more were injured. An earthquake in Alaska in 1964 reached a magnitude of 9.2, triggering landslides, deadly waves, and severe flooding. Aftershocks continued for weeks and 130 people died. The Boxing Day tsunami of 2004 happened off Sumatra, Indonesia, killing 167,000 people there and 230,000 in total across southeast and southern Asia, as well as reaching parts of east Africa. The Japanese earthquake of 2011 triggered a tsunami that hit the Fukushima nuclear power plant, blacking out its power system and causing the meltdown of three reactors. More than 18,000 people died. Kamchatka had another powerful earthquake in 1952, registering 9.0 in magnitude and causing a tsunami that hit Hawaii with 9m (30ft waves). Miraculously, no one died. What happens during a tsunami - and why are they so dangerous? Tsunamis are a series of very long waves usually caused by an earthquake beneath the ocean's surface. Although rare, they can also be triggered by landslides, volcanic activity, and sometimes by extreme weather above the ocean. Unlike normal waves, which are driven by wind, tsunamis move through the entire ocean column - from the sea floor to the surface. This means they can be incredibly powerful and fast - reaching plane-like speeds of around 500mph in the deepest parts of the ocean. Their force means they can stretch across an entire ocean basin, impacting multiple countries. The 2004 Boxing Day tsunami caused damage in 17 nations. Tsunamis become most dangerous when they reach land. The shallowness of the water sees the length of the waves decrease - but their height increase. Tall waves can be very dangerous. It only requires six inches of water to knock someone off their feet and double that to sweep away a car. Tsunami waves are also dangerous when they go back out to sea, carrying heavy debris with them."

At 8.8 on the magnitude scale, it's up there with the most powerful ever recorded. It's also one that some seismologists were anticipating. Wednesday's quake, in Russia's Far East, occurred on a fault line running along the Kuril-Kamchatka Trench - a scar on the seabed caused by the Pacific tectonic plate diving beneath the North American and Okhotsk plates. Called a subduction zone, it's one of a series around the Pacific's notorious \"Ring of Fire\". The friction from shifting plates fuels volcanoes but is also notorious for causing \"megathrust\" earthquakes and resulting tsunamis. The last major earthquake on the Kamchatka peninsula was in 1952, just 30km (18 miles) from this latest quake's epicentre. The US Geological Survey estimates that six metres-worth of tectonic movement had built up along the Kuril-Kamchatka Trench since then. \n                  Authoritarian states operating without impunity to silence dissidents in UK, report finds\n                 \n                  Has Trump broken from Netanyahu over Gaza?\n                 \n                  Five killed after Russia and Ukraine trade aerial bombardments\n                 A series of \"foreshocks,\" including a 7.4 magnitude earthquake on 20 July, suggested those seven decades of stress were being transferred along the fault, indicating a major quake near the 1952 epicentre may have been imminent. But the moment an earthquake strikes is always impossible to predict, so too is the size or spread of a resulting tsunami. A massive earthquake doesn't always correspond to a massive tsunami.  Read more:What we know about Russia earthquakeWhat are the strongest ever quakes? A host of factors, including the amount of movement on the sea floor, the area over which the movement spreads, and the depth of the ocean above, all play a role. From the limited information so far, even in areas close to the epicentre, the tsunami waves were sustained, but nowhere near as large as the one that struck Japan in 2011. The 9.1 magnitude earthquake that caused the Tohoku tsunami generated a wave nearly 40 metres high in places. The combined impacts of the earthquake and tsunami claimed nearly 20,000 lives. According to the Kremlin, no fatalities have been reported in Russia so far.  It's a very sparsely populated area, meaning casualties will almost certainly be lower than in comparable-sized quakes in Japan and Indonesia. It's also possible that the foreshocks that preceded the Kamchatka quake may have helped save lives. Following the 20 July earthquake in Kamchatka, local tsunami alerts warned people to head to higher ground. When this latest quake struck, with more than 10 times more power than the last, people may have acted even before the warnings came."

        "Content": " An enormous 8.8 magnitude earthquake has hit off the far east of Russia - potentially the sixth largest on record. The quake has triggered waves of up to 4m (13ft) in the Kamchatka Peninsula, where buildings were damaged and several people injured, officials said. It has also led to tsunami fears across the Pacific, with warnings and alerts in place across Japan, parts of the US including Hawaii, California and Alaska, and the Philippines. Follow live updates as widespread tsunami warnings issued The US Geological Survey (USGS) said the earthquake was shallow at a depth of 19.3km (12 miles), and was centred about 125km (80 miles) east-southeast of Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky, a city of 165,000 along the coast of Avacha Bay. Here we look at how it compares to some of the highest magnitude quakes recorded by the USGS. Biobio, Chile (1960) A 9.5 magnitude earthquake - known as the Valdivia earthquake or Great Chilean earthquake - struck in a central region of Chile in 1960. It is the largest ever recorded earthquake, and resulted in more than 1,600 deaths in the country and beyond, most of which were caused by the resulting large tsunami. Thousands of others were injured. Alaska (1964) A 9.2 magnitude earthquake hit Alaska's Prince William Sound in 1964, lasting for almost five minutes and becoming the largest recorded earthquake in the US. There were huge landslides and towering waves which caused severe flooding, and the event was followed by thousands of aftershocks for weeks. More than 130 people were killed. Sumatra, Indonesia A 9.1 magnitude earthquake and subsequent tsunami devastated Southeast and South Asia and East Africa in 2004. It was the most disastrous earthquake in terms of fatalities, killing 230,000 people, including 167,000 in Indonesia, where entire communities were wiped out. Tohoku, Japan Another 9.1 magnitude earthquake struck off the coast of northeastern Japan in 2011, triggering a towering tsunami that smashed into the Fukushima nuclear plant. This led to power and cooling systems being knocked out, and triggered meltdowns in three reactors. More than 18,000 people were killed in the quake and tsunami. Some bodies have never been recovered.

Biobio, Chile (2010) Central Chile was hit by a 8.8 magnitude earthquake in 2010, lasting for 90 seconds and setting off a tsunami. More than 500 people were killed in the disaster. Esmeraldas, Ecuador An 8.8 magnitude earthquake resulted in a tsunami that killed about 1,500 people in Ecuador in 1906. Its effects were felt for miles along the Central American coast and as far as San Francisco and Japan. Alaska (1965) A magnitude 8.7 quake struck Alaska's Rat Islands in 1965, causing an 11m (35ft) high tsunami. It only resulted in relatively minor damage, including cracks in buildings and an asphalt runway. Tibet At least 780 people were killed when a magnitude 8.6 earthquake struck in 1950, destroying dozens of villages, including at least one that slid into a river. Major landslides jammed the Subansiri River in India, and a deadly 7m (23ft) wave was created when the water eventually broke through. Sumatra, Indonesia An 8.6 magnitude earthquake struck off the west coast of northern Sumatra in Indonesia in 2012. The quake caused little damage, but it did increase pressure on a fault that had been the source of the devastating 2004 tsunami."

Dahlmeier had been stranded on the Laila Peak in the Karakoram mountain range since Monday. Military helicopters had been unable to set off due to low visibility and rainfall, said Faizullah Faraq, a spokesman for the regional Gilgit-Baltistan government. The 31-year-old German, who won gold in the sprint and pursuit biathlon events at the 2018 Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang and was also a seven-time world champion, was struck by falling rocks. A Pakistani minister confirmed she had died later on Wednesday, saying efforts were under way to recover her body. Dahlmeier, who also won the 2017 women's biathlon World Cup, was injured at an altitude of about 18,700ft on Monday at noon local time, according to her management team in Germany. Alpine Club Of Pakistan vice president Karrar Haidri told the Associated Press before reports of her death emerged: \"She sustained serious injuries, but she has oxygen with her, and injured climbers have been known to survive for days.\" The authorities launched the rescue mission after receiving a distress signal on Monday from Dahlmeier's climbing partner, Marina Eva, who managed to descend to base camp with help from rescuers the following day. Rescue efforts resumed on Wednesday.

        "Content": "A dentist has been jailed for life for poisoning his wife's protein shakes before delivering a fatal dose of cyanide while she was in hospital. James Craig, from Colorado in the US, had searched on the internet \"how to make murder look like a heart attack\" weeks before Angela - his wife of 23 years - died, a trial heard. The 45-year-old had also searched for answers to the question \"is arsenic detectable in an autopsy?\" on a computer at his dental practice in the Denver suburb of Aurora in Colorado, the court was told. Prosecutors said the dentist had poisoned Mrs Craig, who was the mother of his six children, over 10 days in the month of her death. When those attempts failed, prosecutors alleged the dentist gave the 43-year-old a final dose of cyanide while she was hospitalised in Denver with symptoms that confused doctors. She was declared brain dead soon after on what was her third trip to hospital following the initial poisonings. Police in the Denver had begun investigating Craig after his dental practice partner and friend told a nurse that the dentist had ordered potassium cyanide, even though it was not needed for their work. \n                  US Federal Reserve defies calls from Donald Trump to cut interest rate\n                 \n                  Trump claims Epstein 'stole' Prince Andrew accuser Virginia Giuffre from his Mar-a-Lago resort\n                 \n                  Sean 'Diddy' Combs asks judge to release him on $50m bond as he awaits sentencing\n                 Craig was convicted of first-degree murder and several other charges by a jury at the Arapahoe County Justice Center on Wednesday. District Judge Shay Whitaker sentenced Craig to life without the possibility of parole, the mandatory sentence for a first-degree murder conviction in Colorado. The jury rejected his claim that he had helped his wife kill herself after he said he wanted a divorce following his repeated extramarital affairs. His sentencing came after his oldest daughter, Miriam Merservy, spoke tearfully in court about how she missed being able to talk to her mother about her life and how she felt betrayed by her father. \"I was supposed to be able to trust my dad; he was supposed to be my hero, and instead he'll forever be the villain in my book,\" she said. Craig appeared to shake with tears as his daughter spoke. The couple's son Toliver Craig told the court he and his mother didn't always get along - but two weeks after she died he set an alarm on his phone that still goes off every night at 10pm. It just says \"Mom\". \"I'm sad there's not more time with her,\" he said. Craig didn't testify during his two-week trial and he declined to make a statement before being sentenced. Toxicology tests determined Mrs Craig died of poisoning from cyanide and tetrahydrozoline, an ingredient commonly found in over-the-counter eye drops, according to the coroner.

They said photos from a hospital security camera shown in court depict Craig holding a syringe before he entered his wife's room. After administering the fatal dose, Craig walked out and texted a fellow dentist with whom he was having an affair, Senior Chief Deputy District Attorney Michael Mauro told jurors in closing arguments on Tuesday. His wife's condition quickly worsened. Speaking after sentencing, Mr Mauro said Craig clearly wanted out of his marriage but gave in to \"greed and cowardice\" with murder. \"The jury said it loudly: Angela was not suicidal. She had no knowledge of or participation in what happened to her,\" the prosecutor said. What else was Craig convicted of? Besides murder, Craig was found guilty of trying to cover up the killing by asking others to fake evidence and testimony that would make it appear his wife had killed herself or wanted to frame him for her death. He was also found guilty of asking one of his daughters, who was not Ms Merservy, to make a fake video of her mother asking to be poisoned. Craig was also convicted trying to get a fellow jail inmate to kill the lead detective investigating his wife's death. He was acquitted of just one charge - manslaughter."

Combs's lawyer has argued that conditions at the Metropolitan Detention Centre in Brooklyn are dangerous and noted that others convicted of similar offences were typically released before sentencing. \"Sean Combs should not be in jail for this conduct,\" Marc Agnifilo said in a court filing on Tuesday. \"In fact, he may be the only person currently in a United States jail for being any sort of John, and certainly the only person in jail for hiring adult male escorts for him and his girlfriend.\" A \"John\" in the US is a slang term for somebody who hires a prostitute. A spokesperson for the US attorney's office in Manhattan did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Prosecutors have previously insisted he remains a flight risk and should therefore not be granted bail. The 55-year-old, one of the most influential hip-hop producers of all time, faces up to a decade in prison after he was convicted earlier this month of two counts of transportation to engage in prostitution.

But Judge Arun Subramanian denied it, saying Combs at the time had not met the burden of showing by clear and convincing evidence a \"lack of danger to any person or the community\". Combs is the latest celebrity inmate to be locked up at MDC Brooklyn, the only federal jail in New York City, joining a list that includes R Kelly, Ghislaine Maxwell and cryptocurrency fraudster Sam Bankman-Fried."

        "Content": "\n          City editor\n              @MarkKleinmanSky\n The investment giant Apollo Global Management is close to snapping up a stake in Motor Fuel Group (MFG), one of Britain's biggest petrol forecourt empires, in a deal valuing it about Â£7bn. Sky News has learnt that Apollo could announce as soon as Thursday that it has agreed to buy a large minority stake in MFG from Clayton Dubilier & Rice (CD&R), its current majority-owner. The transaction will come after several months of talks involving CD&R and a range of prospective investors in a company which is rapidly expanding its presence in the electric vehicle charging infrastructure arena. Money latest: Three major broadband providers confirm price hikes Banking sources said there had been a \"large appetite\" to invest in the next phase of MFG's growth, with CD&R having built the company from a mid-sized industry player over the course of more than a decade. Lazard and Royal Bank of Canada are understood to be advising on the deal. A stake of roughly 25-30% in MFG has been expected to change hands during the process, with Apollo's investment said to be broadly in that range. MFG is the largest independent forecourt operator in the UK, having grown from 360 sites at the point of CD&R's acquisition of the company. It trades under a number of brands, including Esso and Shell. CD&R, which also owns the supermarket chain Morrisons, united MFG's petrol forecourt businesses with that of the grocer in a Â£2.5bn transaction, which completed nearly 18 months ago. MFG now comprises roughly 1,200 sites across Britain, with earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) of about Â£700m anticipated in this financial year. It is now focused on its role in the energy transition, with hundreds of electric vehicle charging points installed across its network, and growing its high-margin foodservice offering. MFG has outlined plans to invest Â£400m in EV charging, and is now the second-largest ultra-rapid player in the UK - which delivers 100 miles of range in ten minutes - with close to 1,000 chargers. It aims to grow that figure to 3,000 by 2030. CD&R, which declined to comment on Wednesday afternoon, will retain a controlling stake in MFG after any stake sale, while Morrisons also holds a 20% interest in the company. Read more from Sky News:Visa blamed for payment errorsCare provider nears collapseGary Neville attacks NI rise Bankers expect that the minority deal with Apollo will be followed a couple of years later with an initial public offering on the London stock market. CD&R invested in MFG in 2015, making its investment a long-term one by the standards of most private equity holding periods. The sale of a large minority stake at a Â£7bn enterprise valuation will crystallise a positive return for the US-based buyout firm. CD&R and its investors have already been paid hundreds of millions of pounds in dividends from MFG, having seen its earnings grow 14-fold since the original purchase. Morrisons' rival, Asda, has undertaken a similar transaction with its petrol forecourts, with EG Group acquiring the Leeds-based grocer's forecourt network. EG Group, which along with Asda is controlled by private equity firm TDR Capital, is now being prepared for a listing in the US. Apollo declined to comment."

Money latest: The best places to retire in Britain The grocer ruled out the possibility of a cyberattack and said its website and app were functioning normally, with no direct impact on customers. The issue nevertheless illustrates the extent to which the industry is on high alert for cybersecurity-related incidents after a spate of attacks which have raised concerns about the sector's resilience. In recent months, major British retailers including Marks & Spencer, the Co-op and Harrods have been the victim of cyberattacks, with the impact on M&S particularly acute. \n                  US Federal Reserve defies calls from Donald Trump to cut interest rate\n                 \n                  Apollo charges in for stake in Â£7bn petrol retailer Motor Fuel Group\n                 \n                  Official receiver may step in as council care provider NRS Healthcare nears collapse\n                 M&S has said the attack on its systems would cost it at least Â£300m and forced it to suspend online orders for months.

A Sainsbury's spokesperson said, \"We're working with one of our payment providers to resolve a temporary issue processing some payments for our Groceries Online service. \"We continue to deliver orders for customers and our website and app are working as normal.\" Visa said: \"Visa systems are operating normally.

Customers should not retry payments in the meantime. We are very sorry for the inconvenience this has caused.\""

        "Content": "\n          City editor\n              @MarkKleinmanSky\n A private equity-backed provider of care services to vulnerable patients across England is on the brink of insolvency, prompting Whitehall officials to draw up contingency plans for its collapse. Sky News has learnt that NRS Healthcare, also known as Nottingham Rehab, is close to falling into compulsory liquidation after efforts to find a buyer were unsuccessful. Sources said the Official Receiver was expected to step in owing to the importance of the services offered by NRS Healthcare, which provides living aids and equipment to elderly and vulnerable patients, many of whom have recently been discharged from hospital. Money latest: Lottery ticket sales and payouts to pause this weekend The company supplies wheelchairs, telecare and other technology-enabled healthcare services through contracts with local authorities across the country. Whitehall sources said the government was working with the Insolvency Service to assess contingency plans for the continued provision of services. If NRS Healthcare could no longer supply equipment, local authorities would have a duty to intervene and ensure continuity of care such as disability aids. \"We are monitoring the situation closely,\" a government insider said. PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC), the professional services firm, had been trying to find a buyer or new investors for the business in recent weeks, according to healthcare industry executives. NRS Healthcare has been owned by Graphite Capital, a private equity firm, since 2019. Graphite Capital's other investments have included the Groucho Club, the Soho members' club. One healthcare industry source said the terms of NRS Healthcare's contracts with local authorities had resulted in its financial decline. NRS Healthcare describes itself as the biggest care provider of its kind in the UK, although the precise number of patients to which it provides services was unclear on Wednesday. In accounts filed at Companies House dated March 31, 2024, Nottingham Rehab said its directors were \"satisfied with the results for the period\". It reported an operating loss of Â£5.6m for the relevant period, but said its directors were \"confident there is significant scope to develop and grow the business\". In response to an enquiry from Sky News, a Department for Health and Social Care spokesperson said: \"We are closely monitoring this situation and are working with a range of partners who are supporting local authorities to minimise any potential disruption, find alternative suppliers if needed and ensure patients continue to receive high-quality care.\" A spokesman for NRS Healthcare refused to answer basic questions, including how many people it employs, although it is expected that many employees would be retained in the event that the company falls into compulsory liquidation. Graphite Capital confirmed that it had taken ownership of the company in 2019 but refused to disclose the price it had paid. PwC declined to comment."

        "Content": "\n          City editor\n              @MarkKleinmanSky\n The hedge fund founder enlisted to back a bid for The Daily Telegraph says the offer is \"ready to go\" if a takeover of the broadsheet title involving sovereign Gulf money runs into further regulatory problems. Sky News has learnt that Jeremy Hosking, the prominent City figure who co-founded Marathon Asset Management, is pledging to inject Â£100m of his own money into the newspaper group if the self-styled 'British bid' of which he is part is successful. Mr Hosking, who now runs Hosking Partners, has been working with Dovid Efune, the owner of the New York Sun, in an effort to gain control of the Telegraph for several months. Money latest: The best places to retire in Britain They have been thwarted, though, by an agreement reached with RedBird Capital Partners, the US-based investment firm, to buy the titles for Â£500m following a two-year battle which has plunged the Telegraph into a protracted state of limbo. RedBird's bid includes tens of millions of pounds of funding from IMI, a state-backed Abu Dhabi vehicle, which cleared a key hurdle last week when the House of Lords voted against a 'fatal motion' which would have blocked the sovereign investment. The outcome of the vote was not without fierce debate, with 155 peers supporting the ban. \n                  US Federal Reserve defies calls from Donald Trump to cut interest rate\n                 \n                  Apollo charges in for stake in Â£7bn petrol retailer Motor Fuel Group\n                 \n                  Sainsbury's blames Visa card issues for online payment failure\n                 IMI is controlled by Sheikh Mansour bin Zayed Al Nahyan, the vice-president of the United Arab Emirates and ultimate owner of Manchester City Football Club. Speaking through Mr Efune, Mr Hosking said in a statement on Wednesday morning: \"We have been following the latest developments closely and with the best outcome for all Telegraph stakeholders front of mind. \"We understand from the Lords debate last week that there is now a legal requirement for the government to formally investigate all the foreign government ties that may result in influence over the current preferred buyer. \"Should the buyer be deemed unsuitable, our \"British Bid\" is ready to go. \"We believe our current capitalization is more than adequate to replace the controlling shareholder's portion of the deal. \"My own personal commitment is Â£100m in equity capital.\" Further details of the financing lined up by Mr Efune's consortium remain unclear, including the level of debt attached to his prospective offer. The RedBird-led acquisition of the Telegraph remains subject to investigations by both Ofcom and the Competition and Markets Authority, which are likely to delay completion of the deal into next year. Sky News previously revealed that Sir Leonard Blavatnik, owner of the DAZN sports streaming platform, and Daily Mail proprietor Lord Rothermere were preparing to buy minority stakes as part of the RedBird transaction. Gerry Cardinale, the RedBird executive, who has spearheaded the latest iteration of its acquisition, has described the firm as \"the right owner at the right time\". RedBird said in May that it was \"in discussions with select UK-based minority investors with print media expertise and strong commitment to upholding the editorial values of the Telegraph\". The Telegraph titles' parent company was forced into insolvency proceedings in 2023 by Lloyds Banking Group, which ran out of patience with the Barclay family, their long-standing owner. RedBird IMI, a joint venture between the two firms, paid Â£600m several months later to acquire a call option that was intended to convert into ownership of the Telegraph newspapers and The Spectator magazine. That objective was thwarted by a change in media ownership laws - which banned any form of foreign state ownership. Some peers argued last week that a 15% threshold was too high and that the legislation to permit it was dangerously ambiguous because it could allow for more than one state investor to aggregate their holdings in British newspapers. A further statutory instrument will need to be approved in order to address this issue. The Spectator, which had also been part of the same group, was sold last year for Â£100m to Sir Paul Marshall, the hedge fund billionaire, who has installed Lord Gove, the former cabinet minister, as its editor."

        "Content": "\n          Business and economics reporter\n              @SkyNewsBiz\n Aston Martin Lagonda has revealed a plan to bring forward production at the beginning of next year as it looks to swerve a worse hit from US trade tariffs. The UK luxury carmaker said it was lobbying the UK government to improve the terms of its trade deal with Donald Trump. The company explained that, as things stand, it would have to ship more cars earlier than planned next year if it were to ease the threat to its sales and bottom line posed by the quota element of the agreement. Auto manufacturers had initially faced down a tariff above 25% from April. Money latest: The best places to retire in Britain Since 30 June, that US import duty rate has fallen to 10%, but it only applies to the first 100,000 UK-made cars which enter the US on an annual basis. Aston said on Wednesday that the tariff chaos, coupled with weaker demand in China, meant adjusted operating profits for the year would roughly break even.  It had previously forecast a positive result. The company, best-known for its models' starring role in the majority of James Bond movies, issued the annual profit warning following a temporary halt to US exports amid the tariff chaos. It resumed shipments last month. The United States and China account for its top two export markets. It has not been alone in issuing a warning to investors over the anticipated pressures on sales. Aston Martin boss Adrian Hallmark described demand in China, where consumers are feeling the pinch, as \"stagnant\" in a call with analysts. \"The evolving and disruptive US tariff situation was unhelpful to our operations in Q2,\" he said. Aston said it was reviewing its supply chain to reduce possible negative impacts such as disruption to demand and distribution. It reported a 25% plunge in revenue to Â£454.4m in the six months to 30 June compared to the same period last year. Its core profit measure was in the red to the tune of Â£121.5m. That was 22% up on a Â£99.8m loss. Mr Hallmark said the financial performance also reflected fewer planned deliveries of its Specials models. The company is preparing for the first customer deliveries of Valhalla, its first mid-engine plug-in hybrid electric supercar. That is expected in the final quarter of the year. Shares have lost almost a third of their value in the year to date and were 5% down on Wednesday morning."

Insurance firm Saga recently announced that it is preparing to launch a range of over-50s savings products with NatWest. The company, which specialises in holidays, insurance and personal finance products for that specific age group, said it will be launching an \"innovative suite of savings products\". Saga itself is not a bank, so it works in partnership with UK banks to offer its products. At the moment, it offers its easy access savings accounts with Goldman Sachs. This will be taken over by NatWest in 2028. Is an over-50s account worth considering?  Bowes says: \"The savings accounts are exclusively marketed to those aged 50 and over, which might suggest they are specially tailored for this age group. \n                  US Federal Reserve defies calls from Donald Trump to cut interest rate\n                 \n                  Apollo charges in for stake in Â£7bn petrol retailer Motor Fuel Group\n                 \n                  Sainsbury's blames Visa card issues for online payment failure\n                 \"However, in reality, they are simply like most standard savings products, and don't necessarily offer better rates.

This rate includes a 12-month bonus of 0.49%, and the rate mirrors what you'd get if you went directly to Marcus by Goldman Sachs - the UK-branded version of Goldman Sachs. While the rate is competitive, better rates can be found elsewhere - here's a look at the top-paying easy access accounts around at the moment... Chase Bank offers a 5% AER (4.89% gross) easy access account with a 2.25% bonus, though you must be a new customer who opened a current account after 9 June 2025.

The new law will save small and medium businesses time so they can focus on growing their revenue, it added. Sir Keir said: \"From builders and electricians to freelance designers and manufacturers - too many hardworking people are being forced to spend precious hours chasing payments instead of doing what they do best - growing their businesses. \n                  Freed British-Israeli hostage Emily Damari says Starmer not 'on right side of history' over Palestine recognition\n                 \n                  Starmer's plan to recognise Palestinian state labelled 'appeasement towards jihadist terrorists' by Netanyahu\n                 \n                  British Palestinians call UK plan to recognise Palestinian state 'absurd and performative'\n                 \"It's unfair, it's exhausting, and it's holding Britain back. So, our message is clear: it's time to pay up. \"Through our Small Business Plan, we're not only tackling the scourge of late payments once and for all, but we're giving small business owners the backing and stability they need for their business to thrive, driving growth across the country through our Plan for Change.\" The late payment crackdown is part of a wider government package, including a move to pump Â£4bn of financial support into small business start-ups and growth. This will include Â£1bn for new firms, with 69,000 start-up loans and mentoring support.

Andrew Griffith, the Tory shadow business secretary, added: \"The reality for businesses under Labour is a doubling of business rates, a Â£25billion jobs tax and a full-on strangulation of employment red tape. \"Only the Conservatives are on the side of the makers and will support businesses across Britain to create jobs and wealth.\" Chancellor Rachel Reeves has increased employers' national insurance, raised the minimum wage and lowered the threshold at which employers' national insurance is paid. The Resolution Foundation said this hits the cost of low-paid and part-time workers the most."

But the BMA has argued that pay has declined significantly since 2008, and are calling for a rise of 29.2% to reverse \"pay erosion\"."

        "Content": "By Faye Brown, political reporter  Protests at a hotel in Essex housing asylum seekers \"is a crisis that risks boiling over\", the local MP has said as pressure builds on the home secretary to close it down. Neil Hudson, the Conservative MP for Epping Forest, has signed a letter along with other local politicians urging Home Secretary Yvette Cooper to make The Bell Hotel a priority for urgent decommissioning. Mr Hudson told Sky News that protests at the site have led to \"deeply troubling and unsettling\" scenes, with people coming from outside the area \"not to support the real concerns of our local community, but to disrupt and cause violence\". He said: \"This is a crisis that risks boiling over, and for the safety of our community, the government must get a grip on this situation now, and they must listen and act quickly to close the hotel.\" The letter to the home secretary, which requests an urgent meeting, was also signed by neighbouring Conservative MP Alex Burghart, Epping Forest District Council leader Christopher Whitbread, leader of Essex County Council Kevin Bentley, and Police, Fire and Crime Commissioner for Essex Roger Hirst. It also expresses concerns about the use of the Phoenix Hotel in North Weald, in Mr Burghart's Brentwood and Ongar constituency, to house asylum seekers, which has been subject to alleged arson attacks. The letter said the sites are \"proving to be entirely unsuitable\" and \"placing an unsustainable strain on police resources\". \n                  How is Starmer's government doing? Here's what 'end-of-term' report from voters says \n                 \n                  Wes Streeting rules out pay rises for striking resident doctors saying they have 'squandered goodwill'\n                 \n                  Companies who pay suppliers late to be fined\n                 They added that this is \"creating significant community tension, and leading to public disorder that is unacceptable to our residents and deeply concerning for the safety of all involved\". Multiple demonstrations have been held outside The Bell since 13 July after an asylum seeker was charged with allegedly attempting to kiss a 14-year-old girl. Hadush Gerberslasie Kebatu, 38, who was charged with sexual assault, denies the allegations. He is due to stand trial in August. Since the disorder broke out, Essex Police said 14 people have been charged in connection with the protests and there have been 23 arrests, while eight officers have been injured. One of the injured officers required hospitalisation \"after being struck in the face with a bottle\", the letter from the authorities said. It said that \"large-scale protests and counter-protests\" have attracted more than 2,000 people on some days and deploying police to the demonstrations is \"putting our ability to maintain public safety at risk\". \"We support the Home Office's wider objective of reducing reliance on hotels and are keen to work with you. However, we urge you to accelerate this process and make The Bell Hotel in Epping a priority for urgent closure,\" the letter added. Chancellor Rachel Reeves said last month that the government would close all asylum seeker hotels by the end of this parliament but with record numbers still crossing the Channel, it is not clear how this will be achieved or where those awaiting a decision will go.  As Sky's home editor Jason Farrell reports, tensions have also flared in Altrincham near Manchester, where a hotel has been repurposed to house asylum seekers. Last week, Business Secretary Jonathan Reynolds told Sky News he \"gets the public's frustration\" over asylum hotels.  The government has since announced that asylum seekers will face homelessness if they refuse to move out of hotels, as part of their plans to reduce their use. However, it is not clear if they have immediate plans to shut down The Bell. Last week, after Epping council voted to urge the government to shut the hotel, a spokesperson said: \"We'll continue to work closely with local police and community partners, in Epping and across the country, as we fix this broken system.\" Sky News has contacted the Home Office for further comment."

She was held by Hamas for 15 months in Gaza and was released on 19 January this year, alongside two fellow female hostages, as part of the opening phase of a Gaza ceasefire deal. After her release, she told Sir Keir in a phone call she was detained in a United Nations facility but denied medical treatment during her captivity. She also underwent a series of operations for wounds she suffered on the day she was taken captive, when she was shot in her left hand and right leg at close range, causing her to lose two fingers and leaving her with injuries to her leg that impair her movement.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu claimed the move \"rewards Hamas's monstrous terrorism\". In a statement from Downing Street after an urgent cabinet meeting on Gaza on Tuesday, Sir Keir said the UK's \"message to the terrorists of Hamas is unchanged but unequivocal: they must immediately release all of the hostages, sign up to a ceasefire, disarm, and accept that they will play no part in the government of Gaza\"."

        "Content": " A cabinet minister has defended the technology secretary after he claimed Nigel Farage was \"on the side\" of predators such as Jimmy Savile because of his opposition to online safety laws. Peter Kyle is under fire for his claim that Mr Farage's opposition to the Online Safety Act, which aims to restrict children's access to harmful content online, meant he was \"on the side\" of \"extreme pornographers\". Politics latest: Starmer accused of 'appeasement' by Netanyahu The Reform UK leader immediately hit back at Mr Kyle, branding his comments \"disgusting\" and \"so below the belt\", while also demanding an apology. But speaking to Wilfred Frost on Sky News Breakfast, Heidi Alexander, the transport secretary, said the Online Safety Act - which puts a duty on technology companies to protect children from harmful content - was \"absolutely essential for protecting children and young people from sexual predators and from seeing totally inappropriate content online\". Challenged on whether she agreed with Mr Kyle's statement that Mr Farage was \"on the side\" of online predators like Savile, Ms Alexander replied: \"Well, Nigel Farage is in effect saying that he is on their side because he's saying he's wanting to repeal the Online Safety Act.\" \"In effect, what Nigel Farage is saying is that he's totally happy for that to be a free for all on the internet,\" she continued. \n                  Minister 'weaponising' Savile will make Labour MPs queasy - but there's a bigger risk\n                 \n                  Nigel Farage demands apology over 'disgusting' Jimmy Savile comparison\n                 \n                  Nigel Farage says he would send violent offenders to El Salvador under crime crackdown\n                 \"That's not the position of the Labour government. It's not my position. It's not the position of Keir Starmer or Peter Kyle. And that is the point that the technology secretary was rightly making yesterday.\" The Online Safety Act, which was passed in 2023, requires online platforms such as social media sites and search engines to take steps to prevent children accessing harmful content such as pornography or material that encourages suicide. The rules of the act, which came into effect on 25 July, include introducing age verification for websites and ensuring algorithms do not work to harm children by exposing them to such content when they are online. Failure to comply with the new rules could incur fines of up to Â£18m or 10% of a firm's global turnover, whichever is greater. At a news conference on Monday, Mr Farage and former Reform chair Zia Yusuf vowed to scrap the \"dystopian\" act, arguing it did \"absolutely nothing to protect children\" but worked to \"suppress freedom of speech\" and \"force social media companies to censor anti-government speech\". Describing the legislation as \"the greatest assault on freedom of speech in our lifetimes\", Mr Yusuf vowed to repeal the act \"as one of the first things a Reform government does\". He also argued that children are circumventing age checks on adult websites using VPNs (Virtual Private Networks) to make it appear as if they are located outside the UK. Read more:Minister 'weaponising' Savile will make Labour MPs queasyHow is Starmer's government doing? Here's what voters think Mr Kyle caused controversy when he gave an interview to Sky News where he accused Mr Farage of wanting to \"turn the clock right back\" on internet safety with his opposition to the legislation. \"I see that Nigel Farage is already saying that he's going to overturn these laws,\" he said. \"So you know, we have people out there who are extreme pornographers, peddling hate, peddling violence. Nigel Farage is on their side. \"Make no mistake about it, if people like Jimmy Savile were alive today, he'd be perpetrating his crimes online. And Nigel Farage is saying that he's on their side.\" The government has since doubled down on Mr Kyle's comments, with the Labour Party posting on X on Tuesday: \"Nigel Farage wants to scrap vital protections for young people online. Reform offers anger but no answers.\" At a news conference the same day, Mr Farage urged the public to sign a petition which calls for the Online Safety Act to be repealed, saying he was \"deeply worried about the implications for free speech\"."

        "Content": "\n          Science and technology reporter\n       TikTok will now alert parents when their teenager posts a public video, as part of new safety tools launched this week. Just days after the UK introduced sweeping new internet safety rules, the social media company released more protections for young users. One new feature alerts parents, via the platform's 'family pairing' setting, when their teen makes a public post. Parents can also get notified when their child reports a video, although they won't be able to see the reported content. Other new tools include giving creators more control over the comments they see on their posts and how their fans can interact with them. TikTok has had parental control options for its teen accounts for more than five years, and other social media apps like Instagram also have the option for parents and children to link their accounts. To turn on 'family pairing' on TikTok as either a teenager or parent, you'll first need to get agreement from the account you are pairing with. You'll also need to have a TikTok account. In the TikTok app, tap Profile at the bottom - the icon looks like a little person. Tap the Menu button on the top which looks like three horizontal lines on top of each other.\n\n Click on the Settings and Privacy option, which will take you to a longer drop-down menu. Scroll down and click Family Pairing and then Continue.  Select either Parent or Teen, depending on who you are. If you're a parent, your teen will need to scan the QR code with their app to link the accounts. If you're a teen, you will need to scan a code generated by your parent's account after they've followed these steps. Instagram also has parental control settings that can be set up. Ali Law, TikTok's UK director of public policy, told Sky News the platform views online safety as \"a race that is never won\". \n                  Age verification tools on adult websites bypassed in seconds\n                 \n                  What is Tea - the women-only app with millions of users?\n                 \n                  New internet rules enforced from today - but this grieving mother is sceptical they will work\n                 Speaking exclusively to Sky News, Mr Law added that the company will continue to update protections for teen accounts. \"We know from research we conducted with Internet Matters that when teens feel in control of their online behaviours and habits, it plays a positive role in their well-being,\" he said, \"but they also value their parents helping them to check and understand privacy and safety settings.\" The new features are being introduced as discussions around internet safety heat up in the UK. Since Ofcom began enforcing new age checks and platform settings last Friday, more than 400,000 people have called on the government to repeal its Online Safety Act. Read more from Sky News:Police investigate Tommy Robinson video over assault claimsFive boys arrested on suspicion of attempted murder Asked whether he thought the Online Safety Act had gone too far in its restrictions, Mr Law said TikTok \"already prohibit[s] the vast majority of content classified as harmful to children under the Online Safety Act for all users. \"Unlike most other large platforms, TikTok has been regulated by Ofcom since 2020, and we have therefore approached Online Safety Act compliance with a robust set of safeguards for our community, and we welcome that the legislation sets a level playing field for all platforms.\" When Sky News interviewed a group of teenagers last week, they said they regularly saw harmful content on platforms like TikTok. \"There's some things that are so accessible on social media like TikTok that really shouldn't be easy to find, in my opinion,\" said 15-year-old Freya. Robin, 15, talking about adult sexual content, said: \"I obviously don't go actively searching for it, but it is easy to stumble across, especially if it's on a platform with short-form content like TikTok where you just flick, flick, flick.\" Sky News put these teenagers' comments to TikTok and Mr Law responded: 'The content you describe has no place on our platform.\" \"We have tens of thousands of safety professionals who work alongside technology to remove this content at scale and at speed, and 98% of violative content found is removed before it is reported to us and we restrict access to age-inappropriate material.\""

        "Content": "\n          City editor\n              @MarkKleinmanSky\n J Sainsbury, the supermarket chain, was on Wednesday racing to resolve an issue with card payments made involving Visa and Barclays which was impacting customers' ability to pay for online grocery orders. Sky News understands that Sainsbury's is working with Visa and Barclays to address the issue after a number of shoppers reported that their card payments had failed. A Sainsbury's spokeswoman initially said Visa card payments were to blame for the problems, with the retailer subsequently updating its position to say the technical issue actually rested with Barclays. Money latest: The best places to retire in Britain The grocer ruled out the possibility of a cyberattack and said its website and app were functioning normally, with no direct impact on customers. The issue nevertheless illustrates the extent to which the industry is on high alert for cybersecurity-related incidents after a spate of attacks which have raised concerns about the sector's resilience. In recent months, major British retailers including Marks & Spencer, the Co-op and Harrods have been the victim of cyberattacks, with the impact on M&S particularly acute. \n                  US Federal Reserve defies calls from Donald Trump to cut interest rate\n                 \n                  Apollo charges in for stake in Â£7bn petrol retailer Motor Fuel Group\n                 \n                  Official receiver may step in as council care provider NRS Healthcare nears collapse\n                 M&S has said the attack on its systems would cost it at least Â£300m and forced it to suspend online orders for months. The Co-op saw in-store availability of thousands of products disrupted for several weeks. A Sainsbury's spokesperson said, \"We're working with one of our payment providers to resolve a temporary issue processing some payments for our Groceries Online service. \"We continue to deliver orders for customers and our website and app are working as normal.\" Visa said: \"Visa systems are operating normally. We are working with our partners to help them investigate.\" A Barclays spokesperson said: \"We are aware that due to a limited technical issue, some customers have had payments for online orders, where retail deliveries are due today, declined. \"This is specific to online orders where payments are due upon delivery. Cards used in-store, all other online purchases, or any orders made from today are not affected and customers can use our app, online banking and other payment methods as normal. \"We are working with payments partners to resolve the issue as quickly as possible. Customers should not retry payments in the meantime. We are very sorry for the inconvenience this has caused.\""

        "Content": "\n          Culture and entertainment reporter\n              @gemmapeplow\n  Ozzy Osbourne has taken his final tour of Birmingham - with his family experiencing the love of thousands of fans who turned out to see the heavy metal star come home. \"We love you, Ozzy!\" came the shouts from the crowd as his cortege stopped at Black Sabbath Bridge in the city, a site that has become a shrine to the performer since his death at 76 last week. His family and loved ones, including his wife Sharon Osbourne and their children Jack, Kelly and Aimee, spent several minutes taking in all the flowers, messages and other tributes left in an outpouring of love from fans. Sharon was in tears as she took it all in. Supported by her children, she gave a peace sign to the crowd before returning to the procession vehicles. Each family member carried a pink rose, wrapped in black paper, tied with a purple ribbon - the traditional Black Sabbath colours. The flowers bearing his name in the hearse were also purple. Before reaching the city centre, the cortege had travelled past Ozzy's childhood home in Aston. Just a few weeks ago, he was on stage at Villa Park performing his final gig alongside many of the musicians his music had inspired, from Metallica to Guns N' Roses to Yungblud. Heavy metal, reality TV and biting bats: Ozzy Osbourne obituary On a hugely emotional day, his presence could be felt throughout the city, with the star's music playing in pubs and posters paying tribute: \"Birmingham will always love you.\" For fans, this was a chance to say not just goodbye, but also thank you to a star who never forgot where he came from. His remarkable achievements from humble beginnings and continued love for his hometown, even when he lived thousands of miles away in Los Angeles, meant that for many, the loss feels incredibly personal. 'The Prince of Laughter - not Darkness' Graham Wright, a roadie who worked with Black Sabbath in the 1970s and beyond, up to the Back To The Beginning reunion gig at Villa Park, told Sky News he would remember Ozzy not by his traditional nickname, the Prince of Darkness - but as the Prince of Laughter instead. \"It was a shock he left us so soon after [the show],\" he said. \"The show was tough for him but he was determined to say goodbye to his fans, that was the main thing. It was important for all four of [Black Sabbath] to get back together and do a farewell. \"The tears will be flowing today to see the Ozz man - the Prince of Laughter, not Darkness. He really was. We'll all miss him.\" 'My mum used to say he was a lovely boy' Chris Mason, general manager of The Brasshouse pub, which is next to Black Sabbath Bridge, said music by the band and Ozzy's solo material had been played pretty much \"on loop\" since his death. \"I'm a metal fan and Ozzy being the godfather of the scene - if not for Ozzy and Black Sabbath, we wouldn't have heavy metal,\" he said. \"This is what Birmingham is about, bringing people together, and Ozzy and Black Sabbath did that. \"He was Mr Birmingham and his family have brought him back.\" Mohabbat Ali, who used to live on the same street as Ozzy's childhood home, said the property had become one of the focal points for tributes in the city. Describing what it was like living near him, he said: \"He played guitars, very loud at night sometimes, but my mum used to say he was a lovely boy.\" Arts and entertainment correspondent The sea of black was always a given â but this wasnât about respecting funeral traditions. Ozzy himself had previously said he wanted his send-off, when it came, to be a celebration and not a \"mope-fest\". This was his final tour in the city that meant so much to him. For fans, he meant so much to them. For his family, the emotion was raw.\nSharon, his soulmate, has spent her life and career organising his shows, and it was clear how hard this day was for her.  After they left, fans flooded the streets to lay flowers. Not since David Bowie has an artist's death prompted such an outpouring of emotion. From an era of preening rock gods, Ozzy was the real deal -  one of the most notorious figures in rock, but a man who remained as Brummie as can be. 'A true legend who never forgot his roots' Birmingham's lord mayor, Councillor Zafar Iqbal, also attended the procession and spoke of the city's pride in Ozzy. \"What a great honour for us to have him here one last time,\" he said. \"The love for Ozzy - well, you can feel it in the air.\" The star put both Aston and Birmingham on the map, he said, and always took the time to get to know people. Mr Iqbal said Ozzy sent him a letter after reading on the mayor's website biography how he had struggled with dyslexia at school - something the star identified with. \"I've got the letter in a frame and it's in my office... he was just a natural human being, down to earth. You wouldn't have known he was a rock star - but he was a true legend, who never forgot his roots.\""

        "Content": " Disgraced hip hop mogul Sean \"Diddy\" Combs has asked a judge to release him on a $50m bond as he waits to be sentenced for prostitution-related offences. Combs's lawyer has argued that conditions at the Metropolitan Detention Centre in Brooklyn are dangerous and noted that others convicted of similar offences were typically released before sentencing. \"Sean Combs should not be in jail for this conduct,\" Marc Agnifilo said in a court filing on Tuesday. \"In fact, he may be the only person currently in a United States jail for being any sort of John, and certainly the only person in jail for hiring adult male escorts for him and his girlfriend.\" A \"John\" in the US is a slang term for somebody who hires a prostitute. A spokesperson for the US attorney's office in Manhattan did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Prosecutors have previously insisted he remains a flight risk and should therefore not be granted bail. The 55-year-old, one of the most influential hip-hop producers of all time, faces up to a decade in prison after he was convicted earlier this month of two counts of transportation to engage in prostitution. The charges relate to how he flew people around the US, including his girlfriends and male sex workers, for sexual encounters. Read more:The rise and fall of Sean 'Diddy' CombsWhat it was like in court for start of P Diddy trial Combs was cleared of three more serious charges - two for sex trafficking and one for racketeering conspiracy - following his landmark trial in New York. A conviction on one of those charges could have put him in prison for life. Immediately after he was acquitted of those charges on 2 July, Mr Agnifilo had asked that Combs be released on bond. But Judge Arun Subramanian denied it, saying Combs at the time had not met the burden of showing by clear and convincing evidence a \"lack of danger to any person or the community\". Combs is the latest celebrity inmate to be locked up at MDC Brooklyn, the only federal jail in New York City, joining a list that includes R Kelly, Ghislaine Maxwell and cryptocurrency fraudster Sam Bankman-Fried."
