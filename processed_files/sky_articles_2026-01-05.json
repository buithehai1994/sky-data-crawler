        "Content": "Donald Trump has doubled down on his territorial ambitions for Greenland - despite warnings that his plans for the Danish territory could destroy NATO. The US president has been vocal about his desire to take control of the self-governing, mineral-rich Arctic island since returning to the White House, despite America and Denmark being NATO allies. Speaking after a US raid captured Venezuelan leader Nicolas Maduro, he told The Atlantic \"we need it for defence\". Maduro in court: Latest updates on Venezuela Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen has since warned that, in the event of a US invasion of the territory, \"everything stops… including NATO\". And though Sir Keir Starmer has thrown his weight behind his Danish counterpart, Mr Trump has refused to back down, insisting he needs the island \"right now\". 'We need it for national security' Speaking to Sky's US partner network NBC News on Monday evening, the US president said: \"We need Greenland for national security, and that includes Europe. \"You know I'm very loyal to Europe. We need it for national security, right now. \"I think that Greenland is very important for the national security of the United States, Europe, and other parts of the free world.\" He also said he had \"no timeline\" for taking action, but maintained that he is \"very serious\" in his intent. US has no right to Greenland, says Danish PM In her statement on Sunday, Ms Frederiksen said: \"It makes absolutely no sense to ⁠talk about the US needing to take over Greenland. \"The US has no right to annex any of the three countries in ​the Danish Kingdom. \"I would therefore strongly urge the ‌US to stop the threats against a historically close ally and against another country and another people, who have very clearly ​said that they are not for sale.\" Responding, Sir Keir told Sky News: \"I stand with her. She's right about the future of Greenland.\" He said: \"Denmark is a close European ally, a close NATO ally. And the future therefore has to be for Greenland, for the Kingdom of Denmark, and only for Greenland and the Kingdom of Denmark.\" Sir Keir is set to meet fellow international leaders on Tuesday for the first time since the Venezuela raid. France's president, Emmanuel Macron, is hosting a summit of Ukraine's Coalition of the Willing allies in Paris. Read more:Where could US strike next?Why Trump may not stop with Venezuela Echoing the Danish prime minister, former defence secretary Ben Wallace told Sky News' Politics Hub that the US annexing Greenland \"would be a very, very severe crisis for NATO\". He also warned Vladimir Putin could be emboldened by Mr Trump demonstrating that \"legality doesn't matter\" if \"you're the biggest boy in the playground\". Sir Ben added: \"If the biggest backer of NATO, the man who currently provides 70% of the capability of NATO, decides that he's not for that any more, or indeed isn't going to be triggered by the breach of the sort of alliance, that's much more dangerous.\" To justify his actions on the international stage, Mr Trump has used the Monroe Doctrine - named for former US president James Monroe, who asserted the right of the US to intervene in foreign affairs across the Americas in its own interest. Mr Trump has now renamed it the Donroe Doctrine, proclaiming \"we have superseded it by a lot\" and \"American dominance in the Western Hemisphere will never be questioned again\". The US has a military base in Greenland, but its people have shown no appetite for a full American takeover. Vice President JD Vance was given the cold shoulder during a visit last year, and the head of the US base was sacked after criticising comments he made during his trip."

Cognitive tests for older drivers could also be considered as part of a broader road safety strategy that aims to reduce deaths and injuries without limiting the independence of older drivers. The government's plans - which will be published in full on Wednesday - aim to cut road deaths and serious injuries by 65% by 2035, and by 70% for children under 16. About 24% of drivers killed in collisions in 2024 were aged 70 or older, while older drivers accounted for 12% of all car crash casualties. Lilian Greenwood, local transport minister, said: \"We know driving is important for older people's well-being and independence, but we must ensure everyone on our roads is safe. \"As the country's older population grows, this first road safety strategy in over a decade will balance personal freedoms with measures to save lives.\" Read more from Sky News:Arctic blitz spreads across UKAll New Year's bar fire victims identified It was reported last year that the strategy may also see those caught not wearing a seatbelt receive penalty points for the first time, while drivers found on the road without insurance could face more severe consequences.

        "Content": "\n          City editor\n              @MarkKleinmanSky\n The retailers Claire's and The Original Factory Shop (TOFS) are on the brink of collapse, putting more than 2,000 jobs at risk in a bleak start to the new year for the British high street. Sky News has learnt that the two chains are understood to be filing notices of intention to appoint administrators just days after the conclusion of the crucial Christmas trading period. The filings will buy both Claire's and TOFS temporary breathing space from creditors, underlining Britain's fragile retail environment as the industry's biggest players prepare to report publicly on their festive sales performance. Money latest: Tesco revives value stripes The two chains, which between them trade from just over 300 stores and employ about 2,500 people, are both owned by the investment firm Modella Capital. It snapped up both TOFS, which was already on the brink of collapse, and Claire's, which had called in administrators, in separate deals over the course of several months last year. Sources said that a combination of government policy, with a significantly increased tax burden on the retail industry, and demands from landlords to take back swathes of Claires' and TOFS' shops, had rendered the future of both chains in their current forms unviable. \n                  Rush for gold and US oil shares after Trump's Venezuela strike\n                 \n                  Tesco brings back old-school logo in battle with Aldi | Money blog\n                 \n                  Lindsey oil refinery buyer will not restart fuel production\n                 Interpath Advisory, which handled a company voluntary arrangement for TOFS soon after Modella bought the business, and Kroll are expected to handle the TOFS and Claire's administrations respectively, according to sources in the insolvency profession. One added that the intention was likely to be for the administrators to continue trading the two businesses while seeking buyers. The retail industry continues to face significant headwinds, with data from Sensormatic Solutions showing that retail football on December 23, the last full shopping day before Christmas, fell 13.1% year on year. Along with the higher payroll costs, which have disproportionately impacted smaller and medium-sized retailers, many industry analysts are warning of a further bloodbath across the sector this year. In 2025, chains including Poundland and River Island were forced to turn to restructuring processes to avert collapse. Modella also owns businesses including WH Smith's historic high street estate, which it has rebranded as TG Jones, as well as Hobbycraft. In the case of TOFS, the shift to a new third-party logistics provider is thought to have contributed to its challenges following last year's deal. Claire's, meanwhile, was hit by the decision of its largest concession partner to terminate their agreement following Modella's takeover. The US parent of Claire's filed for bankruptcy protection last year and was eventually sold, with the new owner granting a licence to Modella to run the UK stores. It had previously traded from nearly 300 shops in the UK, but has been hit by changes in consumer behaviour among its traditional teenage customer base. Significant numbers of jobs were lost in restructuring processes prior to Modella's purchase of the business. Modella declined to comment when contacted by Sky News on Monday afternoon."

        "Content": "\n          US correspondent\n              @marthakelner\n I heard Nicolas Maduro before I saw him. The jangle of his ankle shackles alerting a packed courtroom to the presence of the captured Venezuelan president right outside.   It was exactly midday on the 26th floor of the federal court in New York, with the large windows offering sweeping views of the Manhattan skyline and the Hudson river beyond. Around 50 journalists, a few dozen members of the public and a handful of police officers from the Drug Enforcement Agency, the body responsible for building the case against him, waited in anticipation in the public gallery. Follow latest: Trump responds after Maduro court hearing Three days ago, Maduro had been enjoying the opulence of his palace in Caracas. Now he is facing the full force of the US justice system, going from president to defendant in one long weekend. He was wearing prison-issued blue and orange clothes, and was brought into court by two US marshals. He made intense eye contact with certain people in the court, wishing them \"Happy New Year\" three or four times. He shook hands with the marshals and defence lawyers sitting on either side of him. His wife, Cilia Flores, the former first lady who is also indicted, was in court with him, sitting two seats away from her husband. She appeared to have bruising on her right eye and was wearing a bandage. Initial court hearings are often very procedural and bland, but this was anything but. Maduro took every opportunity to assert his innocence and insist he was still the president of Venezuela. When asked to confirm his identity, he told the judge he had been \"captured\" and \"kidnapped,\" before the judge interrupted him and asked him only to respond with his name. Before the hearing started, the public gallery was warned by a court attendant to remain seated and silent for the duration of the hearing and not to attempt to speak to the defendant. Read more:Where could US strike next?Was US attack in Venezuela legal?What are jail conditions like for Maduro? But there was an astounding moment right at the end of the hearing. As Maduro was being shuffled out of the courtroom by the US marshals, a man wearing a suit in the public gallery stood up and began shouting at him in Spanish. They had a terse exchange, with Maduro staring down the man. That man, I found out later, is 33-year-old Pedro Rojas, a Venezuelan in exile. I spoke with him outside court and he told me he'd been a political prisoner in Venezuela for four months in 2019 and was now living in the US state of Georgia. \"I told Nicolas Maduro Moros that he will pay,\" he told me. \"That the United States of America will bring him to justice. That starting today, 5 January 2026, the golden age of Venezuela begins. \"Nicolas Maduro told me that he was innocent and that he was a man of God. I told him that we are also men of God, because we have never attacked the Venezuelan Church, as he has done on numerous occasions.\" After the hearing concluded, Maduro, in a motorcade, was taken back to prison. His next hearing set for March. The consequences of his capture, unknown."

Mourners embraced before relatives boarded the aircraft. Authorities believe the fire was triggered by festive sparklers on top of Champagne bottles that came too close to the ceiling. A criminal investigation has been opened into the Le Constellation bar managers. The two are suspected of involuntary homicide, involuntary bodily harm and involuntarily causing a fire, according to the Valais region's chief prosecutor."

Eymaiyah Lee Bradshaw-McKoy, 18, Mia Campos-Jorge, 19, and Jaidee Bingham, 18, chased and beat up Anthony Marks, 51, on 10 August 2024. Mr Marks suffered a head injury with bleeding on the brain, which he died from five weeks later. Photographs from the night of the attack showed the laughing teenagers, then aged 16 and 17, before and after they carried out the killing. Drug dealer Bingham, known as Ghost, caused the fatal injury by hitting Mr Marks over the head twice with a glass bottle after he had fallen to the ground. Audio from a CCTV camera picked up male and female voices shouting: \"Hit him again. Kick kicking. Do it again. Have you learned your lesson yet?\" Video recordings, shot as the teenagers left the scene in a car with false number plates, showed the group in a celebratory mood, with one saying: \"We messed up a man today.\" \n                  Thieves drill into German bank vault to steal valuables worth tens of millions of euros\n                 \n                  Jail for burglars who used Grindr dating app to dupe victims\n                 \n                  Six immigration officers charged over alleged thefts from migrants\n                 The assault was said to have been a \"punishment\" beating after one of the young women, who worked as drug runners, was violently robbed. Police pieced together events and identified the defendants from CCTV footage and analysis of mobile phones. Bingham, from Dagenham, was jailed for life with a minimum term of 16 years after being found guilty of murder by a jury. Bradshaw-McKoy, from Brixton, and Campos-Jorge, from Tottenham, were jailed for 47 months and 42 months respectively, after being convicted of manslaughter. During sentencing at the Old Bailey on Monday, Judge Mark Dennis KC said Bingham had \"elevated\" the confrontation by picking up the bottle and using it with \"severe violence\". The court previously heard how staff at King's Cross station alerted emergency services after they found Mr Marks stumbling near the main concourse with blood dripping from his head, shortly before 6am. He was in a \"critical condition\" when paramedics arrived and took him to St Mary's Hospital in Paddington, where a CT scan showed bleeding on his brain caused by the attack, on top of a pre-existing injury, the court heard.

Mr Marks said he told Bingham the situation had \"nothing to do with me\", adding: \"I never took nothing off them.\" He said Bingham and the two women chased him towards a pub where he was stamped on and hit. On being discharged from hospital, Mr Marks was transferred to prison on 13 August 2024 for breaching his licence after an earlier release. The court was told he complained of headaches and slurred speech while in custody, but was not referred for another brain scan. Prison staff were called to his cell after he had a seizure on 29 August 2024, the jury heard. Mr Marks underwent emergency surgery at King's College Hospital, where he died on 14 September 2024 from bleeding on the brain caused by the violent attack a month before. Prosecutor Hugh Davies KC had said there were \"missed opportunities\" for medical intervention, but Mr Marks would not have died if he had not been assaulted in the first place.

        "Content": "Manchester United head coach Ruben Amorim has been sacked after 14 months in charge.  The 40-year-old joined the club 14 months ago from Sporting Lisbon and has struggled throughout his time in the dugout. Amorim has already said his goodbyes and has left United's training ground, according to Sky Sports News. Darren Fletcher, United's under-18s lead coach, is taking charge of the club on an interim basis. It follows a dramatic news conference from Amorim on Sunday, where he claimed he joined Manchester United \"to be their manager, not their head coach\". It came after a 1-1 draw with rivals Leeds United, with the Red Devils sitting sixth in the Premier League table. Sports correspondent Ruben Amorim has showed there is only so far a manager can push it. Just like Enzo Maresca's hasty exit last week from Chelsea, challenging the leadership in public has ended in the sack for Amorim.\n How much more say should he have on transfers? More, he claimed.  Disputing his own job title in a news conference after Sunday's 1-1 draw at Leeds inflamed tensions further with the Old Trafford hierarchy. The Portuguese said he should have the more powerful \"manager\" title rather the head coach role he was actually appointed to in November 2024. He arrived with no experience of the Premier League and was only 39 years old but he had won silverware in Lisbon with Sporting. He couldn't deliver any in his 14 months at Old Trafford, losing the Europa League final against a struggling Tottenham side last May - coupled with a 15th place finish in the Premier League. And United went out of the League Cup humiliated in August by losing to fourth-tier Grimsby. Questions over his tactical inflexibility had grown as relations are said to have soured with director of football Jason Wilcox. So United are looking for their seventh permanent manger since Sir Alex Ferguson's retirement in 2013 and look no closer to reaching his heights any time soon with the Red Devils sixth in the league.\n Their prospects are also looking no better with a new-look leadership since the owning Glazers ceded day-to-day control to INEOS billionaire Sir Jim Ratcliffe. If anything the mood in the club is becoming more tempestuous. Not only has his first pick of mangers gone awry but there's unhappiness throughout the club over the job cuts and cost-savings.\n And the next manager will want to know there are funds to strengthen the squad. How much power will they have and want over the spending? That could determine their future as much as results, as Amorim has shown.  In a statement, Manchester United said: \"Ruben Amorim has departed his role as Head Coach of Manchester United. \n                  Amorim sacked: Man Utd's new leadership may have just made things worse\n                 \n                  Burger King owner Bridgepoint in £800m swoop on advisory firm Interpath\n                 \n                  Axel Tuanzebe: Details of former Manchester United player's £1m lawsuit against club obtained by Sky News\n                 \"Ruben was appointed in November 2024 and led the team to a UEFA Europa League Final in Bilbao in May. \"With Manchester United sitting sixth in the Premier League, the club's leadership has reluctantly made the decision that it is the right time to make a change. This will give the team the best opportunity of the highest possible Premier League finish. \"The club would like to thank Ruben for his contribution to the club and wishes him well for the future. \"Darren Fletcher will take charge of the team against Burnley on Wednesday.\" According to Oddschecker, Fletcher is third favourite to take the full-time job at around 4/1. The manager currently backed as the most likely to take the reins at Old Trafford is former Chelsea boss Enzo Maresca. The Italian left Stamford Bridge last week after a fallout with the Blues' hierarchy and is priced as short as 2/1 with some bookies. Crystal Palace's much-admired Oliver Glasner, who took the Eagles to FA Cup and Community Shield victory in 2024, is second favourite behind Maresca at 7/2. The bookies have former England manager Gareth Southgate (7/1) and ex Barcelona midfielder and manager Xavi Hernandez (10/1) filling out the top five. Football pundit and former Manchester United captain Gary Neville told Sky Sports News he believes Amorim came across as \"honest and authentic\". But he said: \"If the performances are that poor and the results are so poor, it doesn't matter how likeable you are, how honest you are, how much integrity you've got, you're going to get sacked at a club like Manchester United.\" Neville also said he believes Manchester United could still make it into the Champions League, but \"they need an experienced coach who knows how to get them over the line\". He added there had been some \"brilliant coaches\", but \"none of them really fit the Manchester United way\". Football writer Henry Winter told Sky News: \"I think anyone who's been following Manchester United, particularly in recent weeks and months, has seen the direction of travel... there wasn't so much to celebrate about.\" Winter said Amorim's tactical style did not fit the team's tradition and that the long shadow of former manager Sir Alex Ferguson may have also played a role."

The government's plans - which will be published in full on Wednesday - aim to cut road deaths and serious injuries by 65% by 2035, and by 70% for children under 16. About 24% of drivers killed in collisions in 2024 were aged 70 or older, while older drivers accounted for 12% of all car crash casualties. Lilian Greenwood, local transport minister, said: \"We know driving is important for older people's well-being and independence, but we must ensure everyone on our roads is safe. \"As the country's older population grows, this first road safety strategy in over a decade will balance personal freedoms with measures to save lives.\" Read more from Sky News:Arctic blitz spreads across UKAll New Year's bar fire victims identified It was reported last year that the strategy may also see those caught not wearing a seatbelt receive penalty points for the first time, while drivers found on the road without insurance could face more severe consequences.

Additional warnings have been issued for the east of England and west of Wales, as well as Devon and Cornwall. Amber cold weather health alerts for all regions of England are also in place until Friday, the Met Office has said. Met Office chief meteorologist Matthew Lehnert, said: \"The UK will continue to experience a range of winter weather hazards through this week, with low temperatures as well as snow showers and the risk of ice for many. \"A number of severe weather warnings have been issued and these are likely to be updated through the week so do keep up to date with the forecast.\" Travel disruption There was a 40% spike in AA callouts compared to a typical Monday, according to the AA. National Rail has warned that train services in northern Scotland will face disruption until the end of Tuesday. Air travel has also been impacted, with flights cancelled from Aberdeen and Inverness airports because of the heavy snowfall and the runway at Liverpool John Lennon Airport closed on Monday morning. Both City of Derry Airport and Belfast International Airport experienced a number of cancellations or delays. And for international rail passengers, Eurostar advised passengers travelling between London and the Netherlands to delay their journeys on Monday, as services could not run beyond Brussels due to severe weather. But the freezing conditions didn't stop the first small boat arrivals of the year, as migrants were seen disembarking a Border Force vessel in Dover on Monday.

Eymaiyah Lee Bradshaw-McKoy, 18, Mia Campos-Jorge, 19, and Jaidee Bingham, 18, chased and beat up Anthony Marks, 51, on 10 August 2024. Mr Marks suffered a head injury with bleeding on the brain, which he died from five weeks later. Photographs from the night of the attack showed the laughing teenagers, then aged 16 and 17, before and after they carried out the killing. Drug dealer Bingham, known as Ghost, caused the fatal injury by hitting Mr Marks over the head twice with a glass bottle after he had fallen to the ground. Audio from a CCTV camera picked up male and female voices shouting: \"Hit him again. Kick kicking. Do it again. Have you learned your lesson yet?\" Video recordings, shot as the teenagers left the scene in a car with false number plates, showed the group in a celebratory mood, with one saying: \"We messed up a man today.\" \n                  Thieves drill into German bank vault to steal valuables worth tens of millions of euros\n                 \n                  Jail for burglars who used Grindr dating app to dupe victims\n                 \n                  Six immigration officers charged over alleged thefts from migrants\n                 The assault was said to have been a \"punishment\" beating after one of the young women, who worked as drug runners, was violently robbed. Police pieced together events and identified the defendants from CCTV footage and analysis of mobile phones. Bingham, from Dagenham, was jailed for life with a minimum term of 16 years after being found guilty of murder by a jury. Bradshaw-McKoy, from Brixton, and Campos-Jorge, from Tottenham, were jailed for 47 months and 42 months respectively, after being convicted of manslaughter. During sentencing at the Old Bailey on Monday, Judge Mark Dennis KC said Bingham had \"elevated\" the confrontation by picking up the bottle and using it with \"severe violence\". The court previously heard how staff at King's Cross station alerted emergency services after they found Mr Marks stumbling near the main concourse with blood dripping from his head, shortly before 6am. He was in a \"critical condition\" when paramedics arrived and took him to St Mary's Hospital in Paddington, where a CT scan showed bleeding on his brain caused by the attack, on top of a pre-existing injury, the court heard.

Mr Marks said he told Bingham the situation had \"nothing to do with me\", adding: \"I never took nothing off them.\" He said Bingham and the two women chased him towards a pub where he was stamped on and hit. On being discharged from hospital, Mr Marks was transferred to prison on 13 August 2024 for breaching his licence after an earlier release. The court was told he complained of headaches and slurred speech while in custody, but was not referred for another brain scan. Prison staff were called to his cell after he had a seizure on 29 August 2024, the jury heard. Mr Marks underwent emergency surgery at King's College Hospital, where he died on 14 September 2024 from bleeding on the brain caused by the violent attack a month before. Prosecutor Hugh Davies KC had said there were \"missed opportunities\" for medical intervention, but Mr Marks would not have died if he had not been assaulted in the first place.

        "Content": "\n          City editor\n              @MarkKleinmanSky\n The retailers Claire's and The Original Factory Shop (TOFS) are on the brink of collapse, putting more than 2,000 jobs at risk in a bleak start to the new year for the British high street. Sky News has learnt that the two chains are understood to be filing notices of intention to appoint administrators just days after the conclusion of the crucial Christmas trading period. The filings will buy both Claire's and TOFS temporary breathing space from creditors, underlining Britain's fragile retail environment as the industry's biggest players prepare to report publicly on their festive sales performance. Money latest: Tesco revives value stripes The two chains, which between them trade from just over 300 stores and employ about 2,500 people, are both owned by the investment firm Modella Capital. It snapped up both TOFS, which was already on the brink of collapse, and Claire's, which had called in administrators, in separate deals over the course of several months last year. Sources said that a combination of government policy, with a significantly increased tax burden on the retail industry, and demands from landlords to take back swathes of Claires' and TOFS' shops, had rendered the future of both chains in their current forms unviable. \n                  Rush for gold and US oil shares after Trump's Venezuela strike\n                 \n                  Tesco brings back old-school logo in battle with Aldi | Money blog\n                 \n                  Lindsey oil refinery buyer will not restart fuel production\n                 Interpath Advisory, which handled a company voluntary arrangement for TOFS soon after Modella bought the business, and Kroll are expected to handle the TOFS and Claire's administrations respectively, according to sources in the insolvency profession. One added that the intention was likely to be for the administrators to continue trading the two businesses while seeking buyers. The retail industry continues to face significant headwinds, with data from Sensormatic Solutions showing that retail football on December 23, the last full shopping day before Christmas, fell 13.1% year on year. Along with the higher payroll costs, which have disproportionately impacted smaller and medium-sized retailers, many industry analysts are warning of a further bloodbath across the sector this year. In 2025, chains including Poundland and River Island were forced to turn to restructuring processes to avert collapse. Modella also owns businesses including WH Smith's historic high street estate, which it has rebranded as TG Jones, as well as Hobbycraft. In the case of TOFS, the shift to a new third-party logistics provider is thought to have contributed to its challenges following last year's deal. Claire's, meanwhile, was hit by the decision of its largest concession partner to terminate their agreement following Modella's takeover. The US parent of Claire's filed for bankruptcy protection last year and was eventually sold, with the new owner granting a licence to Modella to run the UK stores. It had previously traded from nearly 300 shops in the UK, but has been hit by changes in consumer behaviour among its traditional teenage customer base. Significant numbers of jobs were lost in restructuring processes prior to Modella's purchase of the business. Modella declined to comment when contacted by Sky News on Monday afternoon."

Speaking at the inauguration in Hammersmith, west London, on Monday, Palestinian ambassador to the UK, Husam Zomlot, said the embassy's establishment \"marked a profound milestone in the British-Palestinian relations\". It comes after the UK officially recognised Palestine as an independent state back in September, against the backdrop of Israel's two-year war against Hamas militants in Gaza which saw tens of thousands killed. \"We gather today to mark a historic moment, the inauguration of the embassy of the state of Palestine to the United Kingdom - with full diplomatic status and privileges, a symbol of our people's inalienable right for sovereign statehood and equality among nations,\" Mr Zomlot said. \"For generations of Palestinians in Gaza, in the occupied West Bank including east Jerusalem, in refugee camps and across the diaspora this embassy represents proof that our identity cannot be denied, our presence cannot be erased and our lives cannot be devalued.\" \"For a people denied self determination for over a century, this is a monumental moment.\" Read more:Israel suspends 37 aid organisations from operating in Gaza'Working on this film gave me panic attacks' - Watch  In recognising Palestine as a state, the UK did so based on 1967 borders to be finalised as part of future negotiations.

Following the unveiling of the new embassy's plaque, Alistair Harrison, marshal of the diplomatic corps, echoed Mr Zamlot's comments, saying the embassy's opening was a \"historic moment for Palestine\". He said it was a \"very important moment in the relationship between our two countries\", before adding: \"This is the beginning of a step change in our bilateral relationship\". Obaidah, a 14-year-old Palestinian from Gaza attending the inauguration, said: \"I survived the genocide, but my body carries deep wounds\". He said part of his family was in the UK, but his father was still in Gaza \"where life is still full of fear\". Obaidah said: \"One day I hope to be an ambassador, maybe even to the United Kingdom, so I can work to help my people and make our voices heard all over the world. \"Today is a special day, this recognition of the state of Palestine by the United Kingdom is very important, but it is not only about recognition, it's about the embassy, about having a piece of Palestine here in London.\" He said the embassy in the UK is \"a place where our people are seen, where our voices are heard and where our hope for justice and dignity live\". Obaidah continued: \"Recognition doesn't ease the suffering and it does not heal every wound, but it gives us a voice, it gives the children like me a chance to live, to learn and the dream of a life where we can grow without fear, where families are safe and where all the children of Gaza, Jerusalem, the West Bank and Palestine can live with dignity and hope.\""

High Wycombe Magistrates' Court was told he is accused of striking her several times following an argument in their home's garden before putting his hands around her neck on 13 November 2022. The court was told that on 23 April 2023, his wife ran into a laundry room before the defendant allegedly grabbed her, hit her with a closed fist and strangled her. The duke is also alleged to have pushed her on the bed and assaulted her after putting his hands tightly around her neck on 29 January 2024. Spencer-Churchill appeared in the dock on Monday and spoke to confirm his name, date of birth and address - Blenheim Palace - and indicate he would plead not guilty. The 70-year-old was granted conditional bail by chief magistrate Paul Goldspring. He is due to appear at Oxford Crown Court on 5 February, where he will be asked to formally enter his pleas to the charges. Spencer-Churchill is known to his family as Jamie.

Ms Cooper opened her statement with criticism of Maduro for his \"authoritarian rule\" and criticised his links to Russia and said his regime facilitated \"organised criminal activity and narcotics trafficking and illegal gold trading\". \"That undermines the security of the whole region, including UK overseas territories, as well as the United States and other regional partners,\" she said. 👉 Listen to Sky News Daily on your podcast app 👈 Ms Cooper noted opposition figures had been forced out of the country, saying: \"These are the hallmarks of a regime that clings to power through fear, coercion and violence, not through democratic consent. \"And that is why, as the prime minister said on Saturday, we can shed no tears for the end of Maduro's rule.\" But Your Party co-founder and former Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has said that Maduro is still \"constitutionally\" the leader of Venezuela. Speaking to Darren McCaffrey on Sky's Politics Hub, it was put to the former Labour leader that lots of countries and international organisations say both the 2019 and 2024 Venezuelan elections were stolen by Maduro. Mr Corbyn replied: \"That is the assessment made by quite a lot of organisations. It is not the assessment made by everybody in Venezuela. There are people who clearly do support Maduro and still do support Maduro.\" While he said he is \"disturbed\" by an Amnesty report setting out human rights abuses by the Maduro regime, Mr Corbyn insisted he is the legitimate leader, saying: \"Constitutionally, he is the head. Who are we to decide?\" The independent MP for Islington North went on to describe the US military action as \"a violation of every aspect of international law\" that has been condemned by governments \"that were not terribly supportive of Maduro\". Asked if Maduro was a \"decent man\", as the deposed president described himself in court today, Mr Corbyn said: \"He's the president of Venezuela, and the issue is the illegality of what the United States has done.\" But the foreign secretary told MPs that Maduro's regime clung to power \"through fear, coercion and violence, not through democratic consent\", which is why the UK \"can shed no tears\" for the end of his rule. Ms Cooper also said that she had today spoken to opposition leader Maria Corina Machado, adding: \"Her unwavering fight for democracy, human rights and the rule of law in Venezuela and against oppression is inspirational and we will keep in touch over the days and weeks ahead.\" The UK's endorsement of Machado contrasts with Donald Trump's position. He said on Saturday that it would be \"very tough for her to be the leader\", and that she lacks the \"respect\" and \"support\" to lead the country. Ms Machado has been a member of Venezuela's national assembly, and has run as a presidential candidate, although was barred from standing in 2024, and said she had been forced into hiding following the election. She won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2025 for her work - ahead of Mr Trump."

        "Headline": "His departure follows a dramatic news conference on Sunday where he claimed he joined Manchester United \"to be their manager, not their head coach\".",
        "Content": "Manchester United head coach Ruben Amorim has been sacked after 14 months in charge.  The 40-year-old joined the club 14 months ago from Sporting Lisbon and has struggled throughout his time in the dugout. Amorim has already said his goodbyes and has left United's training ground, according to Sky Sports News. Darren Fletcher, United's under-18s lead coach, is taking charge of the club on an interim basis. It follows a dramatic news conference from Amorim on Sunday, where he claimed he joined Manchester United \"to be their manager, not their head coach\". It came after a 1-1 draw with rivals Leeds United, with the Red Devils sitting sixth in the Premier League table. Sports correspondent Ruben Amorim has showed there is only so far a manager can push it. Just like Enzo Maresca's hasty exit last week from Chelsea, challenging the leadership in public has ended in the sack for Amorim.\n How much more say should he have on transfers? More, he claimed.  Disputing his own job title in a news conference after Sunday's 1-1 draw at Leeds inflamed tensions further with the Old Trafford hierarchy. The Portuguese said he should have the more powerful \"manager\" title rather the head coach role he was actually appointed to in November 2024. He arrived with no experience of the Premier League and was only 39 years old but he had won silverware in Lisbon with Sporting. He couldn't deliver any in his 14 months at Old Trafford, losing the Europa League final against a struggling Tottenham side last May - coupled with a 15th place finish in the Premier League. And United went out of the League Cup humiliated in August by losing to fourth-tier Grimsby. Questions over his tactical inflexibility had grown as relations are said to have soured with director of football Jason Wilcox. So United are looking for their seventh permanent manger since Sir Alex Ferguson's retirement in 2013 and look no closer to reaching his heights any time soon with the Red Devils sixth in the league.\n Their prospects are also looking no better with a new-look leadership since the owning Glazers ceded day-to-day control to INEOS billionaire Sir Jim Ratcliffe. If anything the mood in the club is becoming more tempestuous. Not only has his first pick of mangers gone awry but there's unhappiness throughout the club over the job cuts and cost-savings.\n And the next manager will want to know there are funds to strengthen the squad. How much power will they have and want over the spending? That could determine their future as much as results, as Amorim has shown.  In a statement, Manchester United said: \"Ruben Amorim has departed his role as Head Coach of Manchester United. \n                  Amorim sacked: Man Utd's new leadership may have just made things worse\n                 \n                  Burger King owner Bridgepoint in £800m swoop on advisory firm Interpath\n                 \n                  Axel Tuanzebe: Details of former Manchester United player's £1m lawsuit against club obtained by Sky News\n                 \"Ruben was appointed in November 2024 and led the team to a UEFA Europa League Final in Bilbao in May. \"With Manchester United sitting sixth in the Premier League, the club's leadership has reluctantly made the decision that it is the right time to make a change. This will give the team the best opportunity of the highest possible Premier League finish. \"The club would like to thank Ruben for his contribution to the club and wishes him well for the future. \"Darren Fletcher will take charge of the team against Burnley on Wednesday.\" According to Oddschecker, Fletcher is third favourite to take the full-time job at around 4/1. The manager currently backed as the most likely to take the reins at Old Trafford is former Chelsea boss Enzo Maresca. The Italian left Stamford Bridge last week after a fallout with the Blues' hierarchy and is priced as short as 2/1 with some bookies. Crystal Palace's much-admired Oliver Glasner, who took the Eagles to FA Cup and Community Shield victory in 2024, is second favourite behind Maresca at 7/2. The bookies have former England manager Gareth Southgate (7/1) and ex Barcelona midfielder and manager Xavi Hernandez (10/1) filling out the top five. Football pundit and former Manchester United captain Gary Neville told Sky Sports News he believes Amorim came across as \"honest and authentic\". But he said: \"If the performances are that poor and the results are so poor, it doesn't matter how likeable you are, how honest you are, how much integrity you've got, you're going to get sacked at a club like Manchester United.\" Neville also said he believes Manchester United could still make it into the Champions League, but \"they need an experienced coach who knows how to get them over the line\". He added there had been some \"brilliant coaches\", but \"none of them really fit the Manchester United way\". Football writer Henry Winter told Sky News: \"I think anyone who's been following Manchester United, particularly in recent weeks and months, has seen the direction of travel... there wasn't so much to celebrate about.\" Winter said Amorim's tactical style did not fit the team's tradition and that the long shadow of former manager Sir Alex Ferguson may have also played a role."

        "Content": "Martin O'Neill is to return for a third spell in charge of Celtic after the Glasgow giants sacked former boss Wilfried Nancy. Nancy was dismissed after just eight games in charge - following Saturday's 3-1 Old Firm defeat to bitter rivals Rangers. They lost six of those games - four consecutively, and trail Hearts at the top of the Scottish Premiership table. But this evening the Glasgow giants have confirmed that O'Neill will be joining the club as manager until the end of the season. O'Neill will be supported by Shaun Maloney and Mark Fotheringham as assistants, as well as Stephen McManus, who the club said would \"join our existing coaches, Gavin Strachan, Stevie Woods and Greg Wallace to oversee first-team matters\". O'Neill said: \"I am really pleased, in fact, very honoured to be asked back to manage the team again, and I am looking forward to getting back to work again with the players. \"I know we would all have hoped for things to have worked out differently under Wilfried, and I personally want to wish him good luck with everything he does in the game. He is a fine man and I am sure he will go on and achieve success again, I have no doubt of that. \"For me, I've been asked to take this great job on again and my focus will be to try and get us back to winning ways if we can. We will need everyone right behind us. \"We still have a lot to look forward to and a lot to try and achieve, and myself, Shaun and the coaching staff and, of course, the players will be giving everything to achieve all the success we can for the club.\" Brian Wilson, Celtic's Interim chairman, said: \"The way things worked out for Wilfried Nancy is an intense disappointment, not least from a purely human perspective. We wish him and his family well. \"By bringing Martin back to the club, we look forward with confidence, giving the team real focus for the challenges ahead. He is a manager the players, staff and supporters know well, with a peerless reputation in football and a deep commitment to Celtic. \"The immediate priority is to get back to winning ways, and while today's events do not address every issue, I would appeal for unity within the stadium to create the best possible environment for the manager and team to launch the fight-back.\" Head of football operations Paul Tidsdale has also left his position in the wake of Saturday's 3-1 home defeat by Rangers. In a statement, the club said: \"Celtic Football Club today announces that it has decided to terminate the contract of manager Wilfried Nancy, with immediate effect. \"The club thanks Wilfried for his efforts and wishes him and his family well for the future. \"Wilfried's assistants, Kwame Ampadu, Jules Gueguen, and Maxime Chalier, will also be leaving the club, and they take with them our good wishes.\" Read more: Amorim sacked as Manchester United head coach The statement continued: \"The club can also confirm that Paul Tisdale has left his position as Head of Football Operations. \"We thank Paul for the contribution he has made in that role. \"A further update will be provided to supporters as soon as is practical.\" Nancy replaced permanent manager Brendan Rodgers, signing a two-and-a-half-year deal at the beginning of December after moving from Major League Soccer side Columbus Crew.

No. What I mean is we are really close, really, really close, to turn things around.\" Nancy added: \"And again, I know that we lost, but I have also to be objective. \"The level that we had at certain moments was really, really, really high. This is the reality.\" Celtic are currently second in the Scottish Premiership table, six points behind leaders Hearts."

The US president has been vocal about his desire to take control of the self-governing, mineral-rich Arctic island since returning to the White House, despite America and Denmark being NATO allies. Speaking after a US raid captured Venezuelan leader Nicolas Maduro, he told The Atlantic \"we need it for defence\". Maduro in court: Latest updates on Venezuela Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen has since warned that, in the event of a US invasion of the territory, \"everything stops… including NATO\". And though Sir Keir Starmer has thrown his weight behind his Danish counterpart, Mr Trump has refused to back down, insisting he needs the island \"right now\". 'We need it for national security' Speaking to Sky's US partner network NBC News on Monday evening, the US president said: \"We need Greenland for national security, and that includes Europe. \"You know I'm very loyal to Europe. We need it for national security, right now. \"I think that Greenland is very important for the national security of the United States, Europe, and other parts of the free world.\" He also said he had \"no timeline\" for taking action, but maintained that he is \"very serious\" in his intent.

Sir Ben added: \"If the biggest backer of NATO, the man who currently provides 70% of the capability of NATO, decides that he's not for that any more, or indeed isn't going to be triggered by the breach of the sort of alliance, that's much more dangerous.\" To justify his actions on the international stage, Mr Trump has used the Monroe Doctrine - named for former US president James Monroe, who asserted the right of the US to intervene in foreign affairs across the Americas in its own interest. Mr Trump has now renamed it the Donroe Doctrine, proclaiming \"we have superseded it by a lot\" and \"American dominance in the Western Hemisphere will never be questioned again\". The US has a military base in Greenland, but its people have shown no appetite for a full American takeover. Vice President JD Vance was given the cold shoulder during a visit last year, and the head of the US base was sacked after criticising comments he made during his trip."

The jangle of his ankle shackles alerting a packed courtroom to the presence of the captured Venezuelan president right outside.   It was exactly midday on the 26th floor of the federal court in New York, with the large windows offering sweeping views of the Manhattan skyline and the Hudson river beyond. Around 50 journalists, a few dozen members of the public and a handful of police officers from the Drug Enforcement Agency, the body responsible for building the case against him, waited in anticipation in the public gallery. Follow latest: Trump responds after Maduro court hearing Three days ago, Maduro had been enjoying the opulence of his palace in Caracas. Now he is facing the full force of the US justice system, going from president to defendant in one long weekend. He was wearing prison-issued blue and orange clothes, and was brought into court by two US marshals. He made intense eye contact with certain people in the court, wishing them \"Happy New Year\" three or four times. He shook hands with the marshals and defence lawyers sitting on either side of him. His wife, Cilia Flores, the former first lady who is also indicted, was in court with him, sitting two seats away from her husband. She appeared to have bruising on her right eye and was wearing a bandage. Initial court hearings are often very procedural and bland, but this was anything but. Maduro took every opportunity to assert his innocence and insist he was still the president of Venezuela. When asked to confirm his identity, he told the judge he had been \"captured\" and \"kidnapped,\" before the judge interrupted him and asked him only to respond with his name. Before the hearing started, the public gallery was warned by a court attendant to remain seated and silent for the duration of the hearing and not to attempt to speak to the defendant. Read more:Where could US strike next?Was US attack in Venezuela legal?What are jail conditions like for Maduro? But there was an astounding moment right at the end of the hearing. As Maduro was being shuffled out of the courtroom by the US marshals, a man wearing a suit in the public gallery stood up and began shouting at him in Spanish. They had a terse exchange, with Maduro staring down the man. That man, I found out later, is 33-year-old Pedro Rojas, a Venezuelan in exile. I spoke with him outside court and he told me he'd been a political prisoner in Venezuela for four months in 2019 and was now living in the US state of Georgia. \"I told Nicolas Maduro Moros that he will pay,\" he told me. \"That the United States of America will bring him to justice. That starting today, 5 January 2026, the golden age of Venezuela begins. \"Nicolas Maduro told me that he was innocent and that he was a man of God. I told him that we are also men of God, because we have never attacked the Venezuelan Church, as he has done on numerous occasions.\" After the hearing concluded, Maduro, in a motorcade, was taken back to prison. His next hearing set for March. The consequences of his capture, unknown."

Nicolas Maduro was handcuffed and, at times, head bowed on his journey to court. Every second spoke to a president in circumstances reduced. He and his wife wore beige prison garb, bracing against the biting New York cold as they flitted between vehicle and helicopter for the short flight across the East River towards Lower Manhattan. Maduro to face US justice: Live updates It's a trip tourists pay good money for, in sight of the Statue of Liberty - ironically. For the Maduros, Mr and Mrs, this trip was strictly business. Roads were closed for the vehicle transport end of the trip and military officers rode the convoy, weapons ready. The transfer from prison to court was textbook, like the transfer from Venezuela to the US. The practicalities have played out seamlessly, even if the politics are a lot more complicated. Maduro will be represented at the hearing by one of America's most prominent defence attorneys, Barry Pollack. He's the lawyer who brokered the deal with the US government that led to the release of Wikileaks founder Julian Assange. Read More:Where could Trump hit next?Who's Venezuela's interim president?

It will be the first opportunity to hear the view of Maduro himself on his predicament. The judge who'll preside is Alvin K Hellerstein, a Bill Clinton appointee. At the age of 92, he's no stranger to high profile cases, even if the case thrown his way by Donald Trump trumps them all."

        "Content": "All the people who were injured in a fire that tore through a New Year's celebration in the Swiss Alps have been identified, police have said. Swiss police said a total of 116 people were injured in the disaster at the crowded Le Constellation bar, with more than two-thirds still in hospital. A statement said 68 Swiss citizens, 21 French nationals, 10 Italians, four Serbs and two Poles were injured, as well as one person each from Australia, Belgium, Bosnia-Herzegovina, the Czech Republic, Luxembourg, Portugal and the Republic of Congo. Also among the injured were four dual nationals: of France and Finland, France and Italy, Switzerland and Belgium, and Italy and the Philippines. Police said 83 people are still in hospital but did not give any further details. Authorities said on Sunday that they had identified all 40 of the people who died in the Crans-Montana fire, which started at around 1.30am on New Year's Day. The youngest was 14 years old. A 15-year-old with joint British, Israeli and French citizenship was among the victims. Charlotte Niddam attended the private Immanuel College in Hertfordshire.

Italian authorities flew home the bodies of five victims on Monday. Officials at an airport in the town of Sion stood quietly as Swiss police pallbearers carried the coffins past rows of firefighters and soldiers to an Italian plane. Mourners embraced before relatives boarded the aircraft. Authorities believe the fire was triggered by festive sparklers on top of Champagne bottles that came too close to the ceiling. A criminal investigation has been opened into the Le Constellation bar managers. The two are suspected of involuntary homicide, involuntary bodily harm and involuntarily causing a fire, according to the Valais region's chief prosecutor."

        "Content": "Ten people have been found guilty of cyber bullying France's first lady Brigitte Macron. The online claims were about her gender and sexuality, including allegations that she is a transgender woman who was born a man. The French president's wife told TF1 ahead of the verdict that the online attacks against her appeared endless and that she launched legal action to \"set an example\" in the fight against harassment. The defendants, eight men and two women aged between 41 and 65, were accused of posting numerous \"particularly degrading, insulting, and malicious\" comments about Ms Macron's alleged trans identity. They were also accused of linking the 24-year age gap between Ms Macron, 72, and her husband Emmanuel Macron, 48, to paedophilia. The couple, who have been married since 2007, first met at secondary school, where he was a student and she was a teacher. Some of the posts have been viewed tens of thousands of times. The defendants were handed sentences ranging from cyber bullying awareness training and six-month social media bans to suspended prison sentences of up to eight months at the court in Paris. Defendant Delphine Jegousse, 51, who also goes by Amandine Roy online, is considered to have played a major role in spreading the false rumour of Ms Macron being born a man online. The self-proclaimed medium published a four-hour video discussing Ms Macron on her YouTube channel in 2021. She was handed a six-month suspended prison sentence. Gallerist and writer Bertrand Scholler, 55, was also given a six-month suspended sentence for allegedly spreading the claims, which he vowed to appeal. \"This is horrible. It's abominable,\" he told reporters at the Paris court. \"This shows just how far French society is drifting toward less freedom of speech. Freedom of speech no longer exists.\" Another defendant, Aurelien Poirson-Atlan, 41, who is known as Zoe Sagan on social media, also shared claims about Ms Macron's gender identity and her relationship with Mr Macron online. His X account was suspended in 2024 after his name was cited in several judicial investigations. Poirson-Atlan was given a suspended prison sentence of eight months. Several defendants told the court their comments were intended as humour or satire, and said they did not understand why they were being prosecuted. Ms Macron's lawyer, Jean Ennochi, said after the verdicts were announced that \"what is important is that there are immediate cyber bullying awareness trainings, and for some of the defendants, a ban on using their social media accounts\". The French first lady did not attend the two-day trial in October, but her daughter from her first marriage, Tiphaine Auziere, testified about the \"deterioration\" of her mother's life as the online harassment intensified. \"She cannot ignore the horrible things said about her,\" Ms Auziere told the court, adding that the impact has affected the entire family, including Ms Macron's grandchildren.

Moscow had previously accused Ukraine of trying to strike a residence in Russia's northern Novgorod region at the end of last month with 91 long-range attack drones.

He said: \"I don't believe that strike happened. \"We don't believe that happened, now that we've been able to check.\" The US president had initially expressed sympathy for the Russian charge, explaining that Mr Putin had informed him of the alleged incident. On 29 December, Mr Trump said \"we'll find out\" what evidence exists of the alleged attack, but added: \"I don't like it. It's not good. I learned about it from President Putin today.

        "Content": "\n          Foreign news reporter\n              @MikeRDrummond\n After his sending in troops to capture Venezuelan president Nicolas Maduro and pledging to \"run\" his country, it seems Donald Trump may not be done.  The US president's preparedness to use coercion and military force to achieve foreign policy aims, was on full display this past weekend as America struck Venezuela. Mr Trump has also appeared to threaten other countries with similar treatment. This is what he has said. Follow latest: China demands US free Maduro Operation Colombia 'sounds good to me' Venezuela's neighbour has been put on notice, it seems. The US leader hit out at Colombia's leftist president, Gustavo Petro, who is already under sanctions imposed by the Trump administration over accusations of involvement in the global drug trade. Colombia is considered the epicentre of the world's cocaine supply. Mr Trump said the country is \"run by a sick man who likes making cocaine and selling it to the United States\". \"He's not going to be doing it for very long,\" Mr Trump said of Mr Petro. \"He has cocaine mills and cocaine factories. He's not going to be doing it.\" Asked whether he might order the US to conduct an operation against Colombia, Mr Trump replied: \"It sounds good to me.\" But it's possible any action in Colombia could look very different to Venezuela, given that the American military has a well-established and strong working relationship with the Colombian military. Sky News senior foreign producer Dominique van Heerden says Mr Trump's comments about Mr Petro could instead be a reference to the upcoming elections in Colombia. Mr Petro is constitutionally not allowed to run, so his term will end - and a more right-wing candidate is expected to be voted in. Click here to read her analysis. International correspondent Donald Trump's audacious military action in the skies above Venezuela has put the world on notice.  This is a US president who continues to tear up the rule book of how the international system is run.  And on Air Force One he made clear Venezuela may only be the start.  Across the region leaders are now asking alarmed questions about who might be next - Trump told reporters on Air Force One Colombia was run by a \"sick man\" who likes \"making cocaine and selling it to the United States\".  Mexico also does not escape - the US leader says drugs are pouring through the country and America is going to have to do something.  And the semi-autonomous Danish territory of Greenland has also been highlighted in the past - the US president has raised the prospect of annexation, citing its strategic location for defence and mineral wealth. The US president, it seems, with his vast armada still in the Caribbean, is signalling a return to 19th-century practices of gunboat diplomacy - a world in which the strong dominate the weak. In the western hemisphere it means, according to Trump, that America has primacy. With what's happened in Venezuela and the Trumpian worldview taking shape in dramatic fashion, it's clear the international system is heading in a new direction.  What was taken for granted and was known as the rules-based order forged after the Second World War may now be returning to an era where might is right. Cuba 'down for the count' Alarm bells may also be ringing in Cuba, an ally of Venezuela (and Russia) that has been under US sanctions since its revolution in 1959. Mr Trump said the Cuban economy is in tatters and will slide further now following the removal of Nicolas Maduro in Venezuela, who had provided the country with subsidised oil. \"It's going down,\" Mr Trump said of Cuba. \"It's going down for the count.\" An US intervention now would come at a particularly difficult time for Cuba which was hit by Hurricane Melissa in October. And the signals from the Trump administration are not positive. \"It was Cubans that guarded Maduro,\" US Secretary of State Marco Rubio said on NBC's Meet the Press. \"He was not guarded by Venezuelan bodyguards. He had Cuban bodyguards.\" Cuba's government has said that 32 of its officers were killed in the US military operation in Venezuela. Mr Rubio said Cuba was \"run by incompetent, senile men, and in some cases not seen now, but incompetent nonetheless\". The son of Cuban immigrants, Mr Rubio has long advocated for regime change in Cuba, as well as Venezuela. \"If I lived in Havana and I was in the government, I'd be concerned at least a little bit,\" he said. Mexico 'has to get their act together' There's also Mexico, on the USA's southern border. Comments by Mr Trump following the Venezuela raid have been interpreted as a suggestion of possible military action there, too. \"You have to do something with Mexico,\" he said. \"Mexico has to get their act together\" and do better at combatting drug trafficking, he argued. Mr Trump said he had repeatedly offered US troops to Mexico, but claimed that President Claudia Sheinbaum is \"concerned, she's a little afraid\". Greenland remains in the spotlight Questions over the future of Greenland remain, given repeated comments from the Trump administration speculating about it becoming an American territory - possibly by force. \"We do need Greenland, absolutely,\" Mr Trump told The Atlantic magazine in an interview published on Sunday. \"We need it for defence.\" And unlike Venezuela and Colombia, the icy, mineral-rich territory is under the jurisdiction of a NATO member: Denmark. Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen said Mr Trump has \"no right to annex\" the island. She also reminded him that Denmark already provides the US with broad access to Greenland through existing security agreements. \"I would therefore strongly urge the US to stop threatening a historically close ally and another country and people who have made it very clear that they are not for sale,\" she said on Sunday. Danes and Greenlanders were rankled on social media by former Trump administration official (now podcaster) Katie Miller, who on Saturday posted a map of Greenland in the colours of the US' stars and stripes, accompanied by the caption: \"SOON\". What about Iran? Iran is currently experiencing its biggest domestic protests in three years. The Islamic Republic faces a moment of vulnerability with its economy in tatters, and international pressure building, as it struggles to recover from the brief war with Israel last year. Deaths and arrests have been reported in Iran amid violent clashes between demonstrators and security forces. Mr Trump has threatened to come to the protesters' aid if they face violence, saying on Friday that \"we are locked and loaded and ready to go\", without specifying what actions he was considering. Last year, US bombers were involved in strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities. Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has said Iran \"will not yield to the enemy\"."

Speaking at the inauguration in Hammersmith, west London, on Monday, Palestinian ambassador to the UK, Husam Zomlot, said the embassy's establishment \"marked a profound milestone in the British-Palestinian relations\". It comes after the UK officially recognised Palestine as an independent state back in September, against the backdrop of Israel's two-year war against Hamas militants in Gaza which saw tens of thousands killed. \"We gather today to mark a historic moment, the inauguration of the embassy of the state of Palestine to the United Kingdom - with full diplomatic status and privileges, a symbol of our people's inalienable right for sovereign statehood and equality among nations,\" Mr Zomlot said. \"For generations of Palestinians in Gaza, in the occupied West Bank including east Jerusalem, in refugee camps and across the diaspora this embassy represents proof that our identity cannot be denied, our presence cannot be erased and our lives cannot be devalued.\" \"For a people denied self determination for over a century, this is a monumental moment.\" Read more:Israel suspends 37 aid organisations from operating in Gaza'Working on this film gave me panic attacks' - Watch  In recognising Palestine as a state, the UK did so based on 1967 borders to be finalised as part of future negotiations.

Obaidah, a 14-year-old Palestinian from Gaza attending the inauguration, said: \"I survived the genocide, but my body carries deep wounds\". He said part of his family was in the UK, but his father was still in Gaza \"where life is still full of fear\". Obaidah said: \"One day I hope to be an ambassador, maybe even to the United Kingdom, so I can work to help my people and make our voices heard all over the world. \"Today is a special day, this recognition of the state of Palestine by the United Kingdom is very important, but it is not only about recognition, it's about the embassy, about having a piece of Palestine here in London.\" He said the embassy in the UK is \"a place where our people are seen, where our voices are heard and where our hope for justice and dignity live\". Obaidah continued: \"Recognition doesn't ease the suffering and it does not heal every wound, but it gives us a voice, it gives the children like me a chance to live, to learn and the dream of a life where we can grow without fear, where families are safe and where all the children of Gaza, Jerusalem, the West Bank and Palestine can live with dignity and hope.\""

The jangle of his ankle shackles alerting a packed courtroom to the presence of the captured Venezuelan president right outside.   It was exactly midday on the 26th floor of the federal court in New York, with the large windows offering sweeping views of the Manhattan skyline and the Hudson river beyond. Around 50 journalists, a few dozen members of the public and a handful of police officers from the Drug Enforcement Agency, the body responsible for building the case against him, waited in anticipation in the public gallery. Follow latest: Trump responds after Maduro court hearing Three days ago, Maduro had been enjoying the opulence of his palace in Caracas. Now he is facing the full force of the US justice system, going from president to defendant in one long weekend. He was wearing prison-issued blue and orange clothes, and was brought into court by two US marshals. He made intense eye contact with certain people in the court, wishing them \"Happy New Year\" three or four times. He shook hands with the marshals and defence lawyers sitting on either side of him. His wife, Cilia Flores, the former first lady who is also indicted, was in court with him, sitting two seats away from her husband. She appeared to have bruising on her right eye and was wearing a bandage. Initial court hearings are often very procedural and bland, but this was anything but. Maduro took every opportunity to assert his innocence and insist he was still the president of Venezuela. When asked to confirm his identity, he told the judge he had been \"captured\" and \"kidnapped,\" before the judge interrupted him and asked him only to respond with his name. Before the hearing started, the public gallery was warned by a court attendant to remain seated and silent for the duration of the hearing and not to attempt to speak to the defendant. Read more:Where could US strike next?Was US attack in Venezuela legal?What are jail conditions like for Maduro? But there was an astounding moment right at the end of the hearing. As Maduro was being shuffled out of the courtroom by the US marshals, a man wearing a suit in the public gallery stood up and began shouting at him in Spanish. They had a terse exchange, with Maduro staring down the man. That man, I found out later, is 33-year-old Pedro Rojas, a Venezuelan in exile. I spoke with him outside court and he told me he'd been a political prisoner in Venezuela for four months in 2019 and was now living in the US state of Georgia. \"I told Nicolas Maduro Moros that he will pay,\" he told me. \"That the United States of America will bring him to justice. That starting today, 5 January 2026, the golden age of Venezuela begins. \"Nicolas Maduro told me that he was innocent and that he was a man of God. I told him that we are also men of God, because we have never attacked the Venezuelan Church, as he has done on numerous occasions.\" After the hearing concluded, Maduro, in a motorcade, was taken back to prison. His next hearing set for March. The consequences of his capture, unknown."

Nicolas Maduro was handcuffed and, at times, head bowed on his journey to court. Every second spoke to a president in circumstances reduced.

Maduro to face US justice: Live updates It's a trip tourists pay good money for, in sight of the Statue of Liberty - ironically. For the Maduros, Mr and Mrs, this trip was strictly business. Roads were closed for the vehicle transport end of the trip and military officers rode the convoy, weapons ready. The transfer from prison to court was textbook, like the transfer from Venezuela to the US. The practicalities have played out seamlessly, even if the politics are a lot more complicated. Maduro will be represented at the hearing by one of America's most prominent defence attorneys, Barry Pollack. He's the lawyer who brokered the deal with the US government that led to the release of Wikileaks founder Julian Assange. Read More:Where could Trump hit next?Who's Venezuela's interim president? Not least among the questions for Maduro will be how he affords, and pays for, top legal representation when he is sanctioned by the United States and has his assets frozen.

It will be the first opportunity to hear the view of Maduro himself on his predicament. The judge who'll preside is Alvin K Hellerstein, a Bill Clinton appointee. At the age of 92, he's no stranger to high profile cases, even if the case thrown his way by Donald Trump trumps them all."

Legal commentator Joshua Rozenberg agreed, saying \"international law bans invading another country and capturing its president\". Both experts referred to an article of the UN Charter, an agreement between all UN member states, which reads: \"All Members shall refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any State, or in any other manner inconsistent with the Purposes of the United Nations.\" Both the US and Venezuela are members of the UN. Mr Rozenberg added: \"The United Nations can authorise the use of force, but it hasn't done so here. There is the right of self-defence, but that applies only if an armed attack occurs against a member state. Now, whatever President Trump may argue, I think that would be quite a stretch.\" Mr de Alba added that the attack sets \"a worrying precedent for the region, because it simply means that the current US administration is willing to go against the basic rules of international law to try to impose its decision, its will\". He added: \"It's also, I think, a worrying precedent for the rest of the world because it opens the door to a possible justification of action by other world powers like China and Russia… [to do] similar things.\" Mr Rozenberg agreed, adding: \"Of course, there is concern that if President Trump can do this, what can President Putin [or] President XI do in Russia or China if they want to invade a neighbouring country like Ukraine or Taiwan?\" How is the US justifying the attack? The Trump administration has long accused Venezuela of failing to cooperate with anti-drug efforts over domestic criminal groups. Maduro was charged with narco-terrorism in the United States in 2020. Specifically, he has been charged with: narco-terrorism conspiracy; cocaine importation conspiracy; possession of machine guns and destructive devices; and conspiracy to possess machine guns and destructive devices against the US. He is also considered to have illegitimately announced himself the winner of the last general election, having waged a campaign of fear and repression for years, arresting and locking up thousands of opposition supporters and political foes. Since coming into power in 2013, Maduro's regime has also been heavily linked with terrorist organisations internationally. Mr Rozenberg said: \"You may well say that Trump… is protecting America from cocaine smuggling, is protecting the rest of the world from Venezuela's links with terrorist groups in other parts of the world, particularly Iran. \"So there is every justification from a political point of view for what president Trump is seeking to do.\" Read more:Why Trump may not stop at VenezuelaWhy is Trump interested in Venezuela's oil?Analysis: Maduro's rule was disastrous But he and Mr de Alba both agree that these motives still don't justify the US military operation under international law. Mr Rozenberg said that in these circumstances, you would normally see a leader be extradited, rather than captured through a military intervention. Could this lead to similar US attacks in other countries? Mr Rozenberg suggested Mr Trump will take little notice of what UN leaders say, even if they condemn his military intervention in Venezuela, and that he is pushing for a \"new world order\". And, after pledging to \"run\" Venezuela until a \"safe, proper and judicious transition\" of power, Mr Trump has appeared to threaten other countries with similar treatment to achieve his foreign policy aims, such as Colombia and Cuba. But Mr de Alba said he believes the US government would have even less grounds for such action in other countries. \"I do think that in the case of Colombia, Mexico, the US administration is going to be much more careful because, if they're going to act in a similar fashion, they would need those countries to have a president that was not duly elected. That's not the case of Mexico and Colombia. \"And they would also need an indictment by US courts against the people that they're going to go after.\" He suggested the Trump administration is more interested in \"projecting a lot of strength\" through the Venezuela attack to \"coerce\" governments in Latin America, rather than attacking them next."

Both stars are widely predicted to be in the running for Oscars when the nominations are announced later this month, and are also among the nominees at this weekend's Golden Globes ceremony. One Battle After Another, starring nominee Leonardo DiCaprio, was named the Critics' Choice best picture and filmmaker Paul Thomas Anderson took home the best director prize. In the TV categories, acclaimed British drama Adolescence picked up four prizes, including acting awards for Stephen Graham, Erin Doherty, and the show's young star Owen Cooper. The Critics Choice Awards, hosted this year by comedian Chelsea Handler in Santa Monica, California, honours the year's best in film, streaming and television as voted on by critics and journalists, and are seen as an early indicator in the Oscar race. Chalamet received the best actor award for his portrayal of a young man who dreams of becoming a table tennis champion in Marty Supreme - and thanked his girlfriend Kylie Jenner as well as director Josh Safdie as he gave his acceptance speech. \"Josh, you made a story about a flawed man with a relatable dream, and you didn't preach to the audience about what's right and wrong,\" the American star said. \"And I think we should all be telling stories like that.\" The 30-year-old actor added: \"Lastly, I'll just say thank you to my partner of three years. Thank you for our foundation. I love you. I couldn't do this without you. Thank you from the bottom of my heart.\" Chalamet, who was an Oscar nominee last year for his portrayal of Bob Dylan in A Complete Unknown, collected the gong the day after accepting the spotlight award at The Palm Springs International Film Awards. Jessie Buckley pays tribute to 'giant of the heart' Paul Mescal Irish actress Buckley was named best actress for her performance in the historical drama Hamnet. The film, which is based on Maggie O'Farrell's novel of the same name, explores the relationship between William Shakespeare and his wife Agnes Hathaway - historically known as Anne - following the death of their 11-year-old son. During her speech, Buckley thanked director Chloe Zhao and co-stars Paul Mescal and Emily Watson.

You're a giant of the heart and thank you so much for making me a little bit more human.\" Netflix series Adolescence, which was among the platform's most-watched titles of 2025, follows a 13-year-old boy arrested for the murder of a classmate. Adolescence star Cooper, now 16, took home the prize for best supporting actor in a limited series, while his co-stars Graham and Doherty were awarded best actor and best supporting actress in a limited series, respectively. The Critics Choice prizes are the latest in a string of awards received by the show and its cast, including several Emmys. The stars are also up for Golden Globes this weekend. \"The past year has been a complete whirlwind for me and my family,\" Cooper said in his speech. \"Honestly, it's changed our lives forever and we're forever grateful.\" Bridget Jones: Mad About the Boy picked up the award for best movie made for television, while horror film Sinners won four categories including best casting and best ensemble, and KPop Demon Hunters' lead track Golden took the prize for best song."

        "Content": "\n          City editor\n              @MarkKleinmanSky\n The retailers Claire's and The Original Factory Shop (TOFS) are on the brink of collapse, putting more than 2,000 jobs at risk in a bleak start to the new year for the British high street. Sky News has learnt that the two chains are understood to be filing notices of intention to appoint administrators just days after the conclusion of the crucial Christmas trading period. The filings will buy both Claire's and TOFS temporary breathing space from creditors, underlining Britain's fragile retail environment as the industry's biggest players prepare to report publicly on their festive sales performance. Money latest: Tesco revives value stripes The two chains, which between them trade from just over 300 stores and employ about 2,500 people, are both owned by the investment firm Modella Capital. It snapped up both TOFS, which was already on the brink of collapse, and Claire's, which had called in administrators, in separate deals over the course of several months last year. Sources said that a combination of government policy, with a significantly increased tax burden on the retail industry, and demands from landlords to take back swathes of Claires' and TOFS' shops, had rendered the future of both chains in their current forms unviable. \n                  Rush for gold and US oil shares after Trump's Venezuela strike\n                 \n                  Tesco brings back old-school logo in battle with Aldi | Money blog\n                 \n                  Lindsey oil refinery buyer will not restart fuel production\n                 Interpath Advisory, which handled a company voluntary arrangement for TOFS soon after Modella bought the business, and Kroll are expected to handle the TOFS and Claire's administrations respectively, according to sources in the insolvency profession. One added that the intention was likely to be for the administrators to continue trading the two businesses while seeking buyers. The retail industry continues to face significant headwinds, with data from Sensormatic Solutions showing that retail football on December 23, the last full shopping day before Christmas, fell 13.1% year on year. Along with the higher payroll costs, which have disproportionately impacted smaller and medium-sized retailers, many industry analysts are warning of a further bloodbath across the sector this year. In 2025, chains including Poundland and River Island were forced to turn to restructuring processes to avert collapse. Modella also owns businesses including WH Smith's historic high street estate, which it has rebranded as TG Jones, as well as Hobbycraft. In the case of TOFS, the shift to a new third-party logistics provider is thought to have contributed to its challenges following last year's deal. Claire's, meanwhile, was hit by the decision of its largest concession partner to terminate their agreement following Modella's takeover. The US parent of Claire's filed for bankruptcy protection last year and was eventually sold, with the new owner granting a licence to Modella to run the UK stores. It had previously traded from nearly 300 shops in the UK, but has been hit by changes in consumer behaviour among its traditional teenage customer base. Significant numbers of jobs were lost in restructuring processes prior to Modella's purchase of the business. Modella declined to comment when contacted by Sky News on Monday afternoon."

Shares in energy majors including Chevron and Exxon Mobil were sharply higher in New York in the wake of the operation to capture Venezuelan president Nicolas Maduro. President Trump has said American oil companies will \"fix\" oil infrastructure in the South American nation - home to the world's largest oil reserves. Meanwhile, precious metal miners and defence stocks helped propel the FTSE 100 to a new record closing high - above 10,000 points for the first time. Money blog: 'I protect the King - there's what's most annoying from the public' The initial oil market reaction was fairly muted early on Monday.

Gold is now hovering around an all-time high, costing $4,435 an ounce. \"Investors often reach for gold when the news headlines are bleak or worrying as the metal has a reputation for acting as a store of value during uncertain times,\" said Russ Mould, investment director at investment platform AJ Bell. Ipek Ozkardeskaya, the senior Analyst at Swiss banking group Swissquote, said it was unsurprising that the metals were \"enjoying a positive ride\".  Investors have, at multiple times in the past year, moved money into safe havens, with the metals recording all-time high prices throughout 2025 due to stock market wobbles caused by the US imposition of tariffs and geopolitical uncertainty.  The increased cost of metals is also good news for mining and weapons companies, which were among the biggest risers in the UK's flagship stock index, the FTSE 100 list of most valuable companies on the London Stock Exchange. The index ended the day 0.5% higher at 10,004 points. Energy constituents BP and Shell saw tepid gains but, across the Atlantic, Chevron and Exxon Mobil shares were up about 6% and 4% respectively. Minimal oil moves After falling on Monday morning, a barrel of Brent crude, the benchmark oil price, rose to $61.22.   It's still slightly less expensive than the $61.35 level seen on Friday and above the $62 prices of late-December. Less oil has been leaving Venezuela since the US build up to its interventions. And only 1% of the global supply had been coming from the country beforehand. Why? Even with Trump pledging to \"run\" Venezuela and sell oil \"in much larger doses\", potentially to \"many more\" countries than before, it is unlikely to lead to a significant boost to global supply in the short to medium term. Exports from the country had collapsed in December after the US imposed an \"oil quarantine\" having seized Venezuelan oil tankers. Given this fall off, and the continuing exports \"quarantine\", which US Secretary of State Marco Rubio had imposed to \"exert tremendous leverage\" over what happens in Venezuela, no glut of oil is expected to enter the global market. The US administration has highlighted the need for investment in the country's ageing oil infrastructure to boost output."

It was announced on Monday that Phillips 66, which already owns the Humber Refinery in north-east Lincolnshire, had agreed a deal to buy the nearby Prax Lindsey refinery assets. The Prax Lindsey refinery was wound up from June last year with the loss of 125 jobs after its parent firm called in administrators. Money latest: Tesco revives value stripes Government support meant that a total of 250 other workers were retained until at least the end of March, to allow for the conclusion of a sale. Phillips 66 said its investment would support hundreds of jobs, though it offered no direct commitment to keep on the retained workforce beyond March. \"Following a thorough assessment undertaken during the bid process, the company has decided to not restart standalone refinery operations at the Lindsey Oil Refinery,\" it said in a statement. \n                  Retailers Claire's and The Original Factory Shop on brink of administration\n                 \n                  Rush for gold and US oil shares after Trump's Venezuela strike\n                 \n                  Tesco brings back old-school logo in battle with Aldi | Money blog\n                 \"Due to the limitations of its scale, facilities, and capabilities, evaluations have shown that the refinery is not viable in current form. \"Once completed, the acquisition and strategic investment will increase the company's ability to supply the UK market from the Humber Refinery, boost UK energy security, and support hundreds of well-paid, high-quality jobs through site operations and future investment. \"When integrated with the Humber site, the storage and other infrastructure assets will enhance Humber Refinery operations, improve fuel supply to UK customers, and drive future growth opportunities for renewable and traditional fuels.\" Paul Fursey, Phillips 66 UK lead executive added. \"We recognise and deeply sympathise with how difficult the closure of the site has been for the workforce and the local community. \"This sale is the best way forward to secure jobs, bolster the local economy, and encourage investment in the region.\" Last year's shutdown of the Lindsey refinery left the UK with just four fuel refineries, leaving the country at the mercy of fuel imports to secure supply, particularly in Scotland. Energy minister Michael Shanks said Phillips 66 was the \"most credible bidder\" in the process to find a buyer. \"This agreement marks the next step in securing an industrial future for the Lindsey site and the workers, who were badly let down by their former owners,\" he said. \"Phillips 66 is an experienced and credible operator, and today's sale agreement allows them to quickly expand operations at its neighbouring refinery, with all remaining staff guaranteed employment until the end of March. \"This will expand the company's ability to supply fuel to UK customers, boosting domestic energy security and securing jobs - including hundreds of new construction jobs over the next five years.\""

It's difficult to stay still... The state helmets you see are incredibly heavy and are quite painful. It is instilled discipline to not fidget and readjust. It becomes easier to maintain this discipline when in the public eye and in front of the sovereign. I try and think about how I look and hold myself on parade, which helps me remain rigid throughout. While I enjoy working with horses... the day-to-day lifestyle can be repetitive and time-consuming. Horses need mucking out, exercise and grooming every day of the year. To add that on to all other aspects of the job role can be challenging. \n                  FTSE-100 events group Informa kicks off hunt for new chairman\n                 \n                  Contactless card £100 limit to rise\n                 \n                  Why you probably shouldn't book a hotel on your laptop\n                 One thing that will surprise you is... the time it takes to get kit ready for a parade and the logistics of what goes on behind the gates. Once duties are established, each soldier is then left with the trust that they will be on time, in the correct kit and at the highest standard. It is part of my job role as a junior non-commissioned officer to ensure this happens. The most annoying in terms of the public is... we are filmed continuously by TikTokers. This means any mistake is caught on camera and exacerbated. It puts extreme pressure on junior soldiers when internet trolls/keyboard warriors criticise them. We can be seen as a tourist attraction, which is not our purpose. Sometimes that can feel unrewarding for what we do, as we are dual-role, operationally trained soldiers. Once our time has been completed here at London, we then go to our sister regiment where we then conduct our mounted and dismounted skills and drills within the field army. When the public gets too close to me... I will always de-escalate before escalating the situation, reminding the civilian not to touch or to stand clear of the guard when moving from their posts with an order by raising the voice. If they're not listening, then I will raise the voice further and if that does not work then I will move the horse in a position of authority, which always allows the message to be received. We also have armed police to help de-escalate and help with any non-compliant civilians. I have not been in a situation where I have had to break character; however, sometimes I can be tested if a comedian or someone of that nature tries to make us break character. More from this series:Secrets of a cabbieI'm a self-taught celebrity photographerI'm a child psychiatrist My tip to keep discipline is to... utilise self-pride when it comes to being in and out of uniform. Always put in the best effort you can as it is your name that is carried with you, with all that you do in life. So, look to reach above and beyond what is required. We are only human so when mistakes are made, learn from them and carry on putting one foot in front of the other. Above and beyond every day is a hard ask of ourselves, so the baby steps towards that direction are what counts. We get to work closely with the royals... When we have state visits we escort the monarch wherever they may go, so there are many times we are working very closely with the security and team around the monarch to ensure smoothly run operations. We also have the privilege of the monarch or other members of the Royal Family visiting our barracks in London on occasion, when we get to meet them formally and show our respects. We're not allowed to share any royal secrets... Our duty as soldiers is to protect and serve. I have pledged my allegiance and signed my contract to serve the monarch. It is not in any soldier's nature to be disloyal. It was a privilege to meet the late Queen... I am very lucky to have had a few exchanges with the Queen when she visited our barracks in London after I was part of the first team in history to get the Cambrian Patrol Gold Award at HCMR. This is an international military patrols competition, considered one of the toughest challenges in the world. She then carried out an inspection of the horses and stables. I won the Princess Elizabeth Cup for best turned-out trooper at the Royal Windsor Horse Show, where Her Majesty handed me the award. It's a privilege to have had such experiences. I have had many memorable moments... Leading the Household Division down the mall for Her Majesty's birthday parade as the retinue party and receiving the award for the Princess Elizabeth Cup from her late Majesty Queen Elizabeth II are both my most memorable days on the job here on ceremonial duty. The Household Cavalry Regiment is within the Royal Armoured Corps (RAC)... with our other duty as armoured reconnaissance specialists. When signing up to the army at the careers office, after completing some assessments for suitability, I selected the RAC and was given a few options of regiment. I chose the Household Cavalry for variety of role, covering mounted and dismounted soldiering, ceremonial operations and the strong regimental history. All soldiers on the ceremonial side of our regiment are operational fighting soldiers first... We are trained in phase 1 establishments to operate in the field, including rifle and medical training. We then commence phase 2, which is orientated to our chosen profession within the armoured corps. For Household Cavalry men/women, this entails driving and maintenance of vehicles, as well as further developing their dismounted skills and drills with radio communications and navigation. After this, we go to riding school in Windsor, which consists of 14 weeks of Khaki Ride - learning how to look after and ride horses, followed by five weeks of kit ride - learning how to clean and ride in full state kit. These five weeks are some of the most arduous weeks of training, ensuring soldiers reach the standard to turn out on parade in front of the sovereign. The total training time is 45 weeks."

        "Content": "\n          City editor\n              @MarkKleinmanSky\n The advisory firm which oversaw a controversial costs purge at Manchester United Football Club is being sold to the owner of Burger King's British operations in a deal worth more than £800m. Sky News has learnt that Bridgepoint, the London-listed buyout firm, has agreed to buy a controlling stake in Interpath Advisory. A deal could be announced as soon as Monday morning, according to banking sources. Bridgepoint's agreement to buy Interpath from fellow private equity firm HIG Europe will come after a hotly fought auction which was due to result in a second round of bids later this month. Interpath was spun out of KPMG UK in 2021 in a deal triggered by the changing regulatory climate in the audit profession. Growing concerns over conflicts of interest between accountancy giants' audit and consulting arms had been exacerbated by the collapse of companies such as BHS and Carillion, prompting a number of disposals by 'big four' firms. Interpath has advised on a string of prominent restructuring and cost-saving mandates for clients, including acting as administrator to the UK and Ireland subsidiaries of Claire's, the accessories retailer which collapsed last summer. \n                  Amorim sacked: Man Utd's new leadership may have just made things worse\n                 \n                  Manchester United head coach Ruben Amorim sacked\n                 \n                  Axel Tuanzebe: Details of former Manchester United player's £1m lawsuit against club obtained by Sky News\n                 It is now being lined up as administrator to the British arm of the casual dining chain TGI Fridays, and is also advising family-owned shoe retailer Russell & Bromley on a potential sale. Among its other roles was being recruited by Sir Jim Ratcliffe's Ineos Sports to help cut costs at Manchester United FC following its acquisition of a stake in the Premier League club in 2024. Interpath's sale to Bridgepoint is the latest in a wave of takeovers in the UK professional services and financial advisory sector as private equity investors seek new deal opportunities in a high-margin sector of the economy. Sources said that Interpath had doubled its earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation since HIG Europe acquired the business four-and-a-half years ago. It recently published financial results showing a 26% increase in revenues to nearly £200m. \"Although we're only four years old, we have a clear vision to become one of the world's leading advisory firms and have made enormous strides towards that goal - planting the Interpath flag in major financial centres across the globe, making bold acquisitions, hiring market-leading professionals, and investing in our people and infrastructure,\" Mark Raddan, its chief executive, said. Mr Raddan and other senior executives are expected to retain a stake in the firm following the completion of the Bridgepoint deal. HIG Europe, has been advised by bankers at Moelis on the auction. Neither Bridgepoint nor HIG Europe could be reached for comment."

        "Content": "The UK has raised the importance of complying with international law with the US government following their military action in Venezuela, the foreign secretary has told MPs. Speaking in the House of Commons on Monday, Yvette Cooper declined to say that the US had broken international law, despite calls from MPs of all parties for her to do so, and said the \"immediate focus\" needed to be avoiding \"further instability\" in Venezuela. US airstrikes were carried out across the South American country in the early hours of Saturday, when President Nicolas Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores, were captured and flown to the US, arriving in New York on Sunday, where they have faced drug trafficking and weapons charges. Addressing MPs on Monday evening, the foreign secretary said she had spoken to her US counterpart, Marco Rubio, and that she \"raised the importance of complying with international law and we will continue to urge all partners to do so\". Ms Cooper continued: \"It is, of course, for the US to set out the legal basis for their actions and the UN Security Council is discussing Venezuela this afternoon. These issues will continue to be matters for international discussion. \"I discussed with Secretary Rubio what should happen next and our continued commitment to a transition to a peaceful and stable democracy. \"Our collective immediate focus must be on avoiding any deterioration in Venezuela into further instability, criminality, repression or violence that would be deeply damaging for the people of Venezuela, our own overseas territories, our allies and in the US and other regional partners.\" \n                  What it was like inside Nicolas Maduro's 'dramatic' court hearing\n                 \n                  Maduro says he is 'prisoner of war' - as Trump reacts to 'extraordinary' court hearing\n                 \n                  Humiliation for Maduro as he is transferred to US court\n                 The UK's most senior diplomat said later of Maduro that \"a man who is currently being investigated for crimes against humanity and who has such a history of political repression as well as economic destruction and corruption should not be leading a country\". Ms Cooper opened her statement with criticism of Maduro for his \"authoritarian rule\" and criticised his links to Russia and said his regime facilitated \"organised criminal activity and narcotics trafficking and illegal gold trading\". \"That undermines the security of the whole region, including UK overseas territories, as well as the United States and other regional partners,\" she said. 👉 Listen to Sky News Daily on your podcast app 👈 Ms Cooper noted opposition figures had been forced out of the country, saying: \"These are the hallmarks of a regime that clings to power through fear, coercion and violence, not through democratic consent. \"And that is why, as the prime minister said on Saturday, we can shed no tears for the end of Maduro's rule.\" But Your Party co-founder and former Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has said that Maduro is still \"constitutionally\" the leader of Venezuela. Speaking to Darren McCaffrey on Sky's Politics Hub, it was put to the former Labour leader that lots of countries and international organisations say both the 2019 and 2024 Venezuelan elections were stolen by Maduro. Mr Corbyn replied: \"That is the assessment made by quite a lot of organisations. It is not the assessment made by everybody in Venezuela. There are people who clearly do support Maduro and still do support Maduro.\" While he said he is \"disturbed\" by an Amnesty report setting out human rights abuses by the Maduro regime, Mr Corbyn insisted he is the legitimate leader, saying: \"Constitutionally, he is the head. Who are we to decide?\" The independent MP for Islington North went on to describe the US military action as \"a violation of every aspect of international law\" that has been condemned by governments \"that were not terribly supportive of Maduro\". Asked if Maduro was a \"decent man\", as the deposed president described himself in court today, Mr Corbyn said: \"He's the president of Venezuela, and the issue is the illegality of what the United States has done.\" But the foreign secretary told MPs that Maduro's regime clung to power \"through fear, coercion and violence, not through democratic consent\", which is why the UK \"can shed no tears\" for the end of his rule. Ms Cooper also said that she had today spoken to opposition leader Maria Corina Machado, adding: \"Her unwavering fight for democracy, human rights and the rule of law in Venezuela and against oppression is inspirational and we will keep in touch over the days and weeks ahead.\" The UK's endorsement of Machado contrasts with Donald Trump's position. He said on Saturday that it would be \"very tough for her to be the leader\", and that she lacks the \"respect\" and \"support\" to lead the country. Ms Machado has been a member of Venezuela's national assembly, and has run as a presidential candidate, although was barred from standing in 2024, and said she had been forced into hiding following the election. She won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2025 for her work - ahead of Mr Trump."

In contrast with their clear position on Greenland, Sir Keir and his ministers have been reticent to say whether the US broke international law by attacking Venezuela and capturing Maduro. Earlier, Home Office minister Mike Tapp repeatedly declined to warn Mr Trump against taking military action against Greenland in an interview with Sky News lead politics presenter Sophy Ridge. He said that both the US and Denmark were NATO members, and that was the forum for discussions to take place. Greenland was also different to Venezuela, Mr Tapp added, before saying on Mr Trump taking military action that he couldn't \"talk about hypotheticals\". Mr Trump also said the US would \"run\" Venezuela until a \"proper transition\" can take place. All EU nations apart from Hungary called for international law to be respected over Venezuela on Sunday night, as did Canada and Norway. UN secretary general Antonio Guterres was quick to come out and condemn the US's actions, with a UN statement saying Mr Guterres was \"deeply concerned that the rules of international law have not been respected\".

Pressed on why he would not say the same, Sir Keir told Sky News: \"I'm going to be clear that I believe in international law. I've long been an advocate for international law. \"I'm absolutely clear that this is the framework that applies. Obviously, it'll be for the US to set out that justification in relation to the action.\" The comment on Monday was slightly stronger than Sir Keir's initial reaction on Saturday, when he told the BBC he was waiting to establish all the facts but would not \"shy away from this\", adding he was a \"lifelong advocate of international law\"."

        "Content": "\n          Scotland reporter\n              @Jenster13\n Scotland's first minister has proposed a national bank holiday to mark the men's football team playing in its first World Cup since 1998. Scotland's opening game is against Haiti in Boston, with kick-off scheduled to take place at 2am UK time on Sunday 14 June. John Swinney has proposed that Monday 15 June be designated a national bank holiday in celebration. The first minister said 2026 is \"shaping up to be a very exciting year\" for Scotland - with the Commonwealth Games returning to Glasgow and the men's national football team securing their spot in the FIFA World Cup this summer. Mr Swinney said: \"The whole nation will come to a standstill in June. Even more so in July once we've seen off Brazil and progressed to the knockout stages. \"This is a moment 28 years in the waiting - and I want as many people as possible to share the occasion. \"So, friends, I can confirm today that I have written to the Privy Council, proposing that the Monday - the day after our opening game - be designated a bank holiday in Scotland. \n                  Michael Gove reveals regret over Boris Johnson leadership bid\n                 \n                  Sir Keir Starmer will 'absolutely' still be PM next Christmas, insists Labour chair\n                 \n                  Watchdog criticises 'unprecedented' government offer to delay local elections – as five councils confirm requests for postponement\n                 \"That will mean that supporters across the country can watch our men's team in their first World Cup match for almost 30 years and share in the chance for Scotland to be on the world stage, to attract business development, to create tourism and hospitality interest within the country, and to make deep and lasting cultural and sporting connections.\" The proposal will be formally confirmed once rubberstamped by the King. Mr Swinney made the announcement during his New Year election pitch to voters in Glasgow on Monday morning. Ahead of the Holyrood election in May, the first minister said the SNP will \"offer Scotland hope for a better future\". He added: \"We've all been on the doorsteps a lot in recent months. Voters everywhere are telling us the same thing. \"The UK economy is broken. Living standards are flat as a pancake. Far too many people are living in poverty. Far too many people are struggling to make ends meet. \"Energy costs in energy-rich Scotland are scandalously high. These are the fundamental issues holding Scotland back.\" Mr Swinney claimed the UK is \"lurching further and further to the right\" as he described the language around immigration and asylum \"nothing short of disgraceful\". He added: \"In this election, there are those who will seek to obtain power by spreading fear and insecurity. There are those who will seek to divide us. \"And there are those who don't care about Scotland and instead seek to use the election to further their own interests. Not the SNP.\" The first minister claimed the best way to support the nation's NHS, bring down energy bills and make daily life more affordable for people \"is for Scotland to become an independent country\". However, Mr Swinney is yet to reveal a clear plan on how his party intends to deliver Scottish independence if the UK government continues to refuse requests for a second referendum. Mr Swinney said: \"To become independent, we need a referendum that will be recognised by the international community. \"In 2011, Scotland secured a referendum when the SNP won a majority. It worked in 2011 - and it will work in 2026.\" Mr Swinney admitted it was an \"ambitious task\" as he called for a \"fresh start with independence\". He said: \"Let 2026 be a year when we rightly celebrate all that we are - but also imagine what we could be.\" Adding: \"Where others try and tell people in Scotland that they can't, let us demonstrate that we can.\" During his speech, Mr Swinney also addressed the US raid on Venezuela saying he was \"deeply concerned\" about the situation. Read more from Sky News:Starmer says he stands with Greenland amid Trump 'threats'Power to seize phones from small boat migrants comes into force Scottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar also spoke to supporters on Monday morning. Mr Sarwar said: \"I know the prime minister and the UK Labour government are not popular with the public right now. \"So, I am not running to be Scotland's first minister in denial of the truth. I am running to be Scotland's first minister in defiance of it.\" Mr Sarwar said the \"SNP have had their chance\" but \"blew it\". He took aim at both the SNP and Reform UK, claiming they \"both play the politics of fear and blame\". He said: \"The truth is, Nigel Farage does not care about Scotland. He does not understand Scotland, and he does not want to fix Scotland.\" Mr Sarwar added: \"I want to build something better here in Scotland. But we must confront the reasons pushing people towards Reform. \"When people feel ignored, when services fail, and when trust drains away, it creates space for those who want to divide us.\" Later on Monday, Scottish Tory leader Russell Findlay pledged to cut taxes if his party gets into power this year. Mr Findlay said the Scottish Conservatives would raise the threshold at which Scots pay income tax, as well as for those paying the higher rate of tax amid accusations the SNP and Labour favour \"stealth taxes\" by freezing income tax rates. Freezing rates means those who see an increase in wages can be pulled into higher tax brackets. Mr Findlay said: \"I believe, this year, the cost of living crisis will and should define the Holyrood election. \"It's the number one concern for every family, every business, every worker, every community, indeed, the whole country. \"2026 will be the cost of living election. \"The public will have the choice between five more miserable years of SNP tax rises and wasteful spending or a new era of hope with a common sense focus on bringing down bills through economic growth.\" Mr Findlay said his party would \"fight to bring down bills\", help Scotland's economy to thrive, lower NHS waiting lists, and raise standards in schools. He also claimed that the Scottish welfare system \"incentivises idleness\" and warned that social security spending was unsustainable. Mr Findlay said: \"Scotland cannot afford to continue to park more people on benefits street.\""

        "Content": "Scotland's first minister has suggested the US broke international law by attacking Venezuela and capturing its president. John Swinney said he has listened carefully to what has been said by the Trump administration since the military operation, and although the Maduro regime was \"illegitimate and authoritarian\", he \"cannot see how international law has been respected here\". The SNP leader's remarks are in contrast to the prime minister, who has changed his tune slightly from the weekend but remains cautious about saying whether Donald Trump broke international law. Politics latest: Starmer sides with Danish PM after Trump 'threats' to seize Greenland  US airstrikes were carried out across Venezuela in the early hours of Saturday morning, when President Nicolas Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores, were captured and flown to the US, arriving in New York on Sunday, where they were charged with narco-terrorism. Mr Trump said on Saturday the US will \"run\" Venezuela until a \"proper transition\" can take place. \n                  Ukraine did not attack Putin's residence, says Trump after American checks\n                 \n                  Colombia, Cuba, Mexico, Greenland or Iran - where could Trump strike next? \n                 \n                  Trump says he's 'very serious' about taking Greenland - despite warnings it will end NATO\n                 At the weekend, Sir Keir Starmer told the BBC he was waiting to establish all the facts but would not \"shy away from this\", adding he was a \"lifelong advocate of international law\". In a slight strengthening of his position, Sir Keir told Sky News political editor Beth Rigby on Monday: \"It's for the US to set out its justifications for the actions that it's taken. \"But it is a complicated situation. It remains a complicated situation.\" 👉 Follow Trump100 on your podcast app 👈 All but one EU nation (Hungary) called for international law to be respected over Venezuela on Sunday night, as did Canada and Norway. UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres was quick to come out and condemn the US's actions, with a UN statement saying: \"He's deeply concerned that the rules of international law have not been respected.\" Read more:Venezuela latest: China demands US releases MaduroCould Trump come for Greenland? Pressed on why he would not say the same, Sir Keir told Sky News: \"I'm going to be clear that I believe in international law. I've long been an advocate for international law. \"I'm absolutely clear that this is the framework that applies. Obviously, it'll be for the US to set out that justification in relation to the action.\" The prime minister had more clarity when it came to Greenland, which Mr Trump has again said he wants to take over for its natural resources and strategic defence position. \"Let me be really clear about Greenland - the future for Greenland is for Greenland, the Kingdom of Denmark,\" Sir Keir said. \"Denmark is a close European ally, a close NATO ally. And the future therefore has to be for Greenland, for the Kingdom of Denmark, and only for Greenland and the Kingdom of Denmark.\""

        "Content": "\n          news reporter\n       Ofcom has made \"urgent contact\" with Elon Musk's social media platform X over \"serious concerns\" its in-built artificial intelligence can be used to generate \"undressed images of people and sexualised images of children\". Since the start of the new year, X users - mainly women - have reported that accounts have used the artificial intelligence tool Grok to generate images of them without clothing. There are also several cases where Grok has created sexualised images of children, according to analysis by news agency Reuters. Ofcom said in a statement on Monday that it had made \"urgent contact\" with X and xAI - the artificial intelligence company behind Grok and owned by Mr Musk - and will assess whether \"there are potential compliance issues that warrant investigation\". \"We are aware of serious concerns raised about a feature on Grok on X that produces undressed images of people and sexualised images of children,\" the online regulator for safety said. \"We have made urgent contact with X and xAI to understand what steps they have taken to comply with their legal duties to protect users in the UK. \"Based on their response, we will undertake a swift assessment to determine whether there are potential compliance issues that warrant investigation.\" \n                  Is the AI bubble about to burst?

A statement shared on the social media platform's official Safety account said: \"We take action against illegal content on X, including Child Sexual Abuse Material (CSAM), by removing it, permanently suspending accounts, and working with local governments and law enforcement as necessary.\" A post on the Grok X account previously said there had been \"isolated cases where users prompted for and received AI images depicting minors in minimal clothing. \"xAI has safeguards, but improvements are ongoing to block such requests entirely,\" it added. Under the Online Safety Act, it is illegal to share, or threaten to share, intimate photos or videos of someone - including deepfake images - without their permission. The act, which became law last July, also requires social media firms to prevent and remove child sexual abuse material when they become aware of it. AI images 'can do quite a lot of damage', says expert Speaking to Sky News about the use of Grok to generate images of women undressed, a cybersecurity expert has highlighted a lack of \"international, treaty-level agreement on how we're going to handle AI\". Charlotte Wilson, head of enterprise at global firm Check Point, said: \"You look how accessible some of these toolkits are, they're like what we used to see with malware and phishing toolkits - where from a really low point of entry, you can do quite a lot of damage to an individual, a brand reputation, a group of people. And [AI image generation] disproportionately impacts women.\" \"We don't seem to have a global, international, treaty-level agreement on how we're going to handle AI,\" she continued. \"You've got the US looking to handle it one way, you've got the EU trying to regulate separately. \"Other than being able to go and seek the criminal through whatever market and find out who did it and taking that person down, I don't see us collaborating [on policing deepfakes] globally.\" Read more from Sky News:The 40 jobs 'most at risk' from AI - and 40 it can't touchTikTok faces legal action over moderator cuts It comes after French ministers reported sexually explicit content generated by Grok on X to prosecutors on Friday, saying in a statement that the \"sexual and sexist\" content was \"manifestly illegal\". The ministers said they had also reported the content to French media regulator Arcom for checks on whether it complied with the European Union's Digital Services Act."

        "Content": "Timothee Chalamet and Jessie Buckley have picked up big acting prizes at the Critics Choice Awards, which have kicked off Hollywood's awards season. Both stars are widely predicted to be in the running for Oscars when the nominations are announced later this month, and are also among the nominees at this weekend's Golden Globes ceremony. One Battle After Another, starring nominee Leonardo DiCaprio, was named the Critics' Choice best picture and filmmaker Paul Thomas Anderson took home the best director prize. In the TV categories, acclaimed British drama Adolescence picked up four prizes, including acting awards for Stephen Graham, Erin Doherty, and the show's young star Owen Cooper. The Critics Choice Awards, hosted this year by comedian Chelsea Handler in Santa Monica, California, honours the year's best in film, streaming and television as voted on by critics and journalists, and are seen as an early indicator in the Oscar race. Chalamet received the best actor award for his portrayal of a young man who dreams of becoming a table tennis champion in Marty Supreme - and thanked his girlfriend Kylie Jenner as well as director Josh Safdie as he gave his acceptance speech. \"Josh, you made a story about a flawed man with a relatable dream, and you didn't preach to the audience about what's right and wrong,\" the American star said. \"And I think we should all be telling stories like that.\" The 30-year-old actor added: \"Lastly, I'll just say thank you to my partner of three years. Thank you for our foundation. I love you. I couldn't do this without you. Thank you from the bottom of my heart.\" Chalamet, who was an Oscar nominee last year for his portrayal of Bob Dylan in A Complete Unknown, collected the gong the day after accepting the spotlight award at The Palm Springs International Film Awards. Jessie Buckley pays tribute to 'giant of the heart' Paul Mescal Irish actress Buckley was named best actress for her performance in the historical drama Hamnet. The film, which is based on Maggie O'Farrell's novel of the same name, explores the relationship between William Shakespeare and his wife Agnes Hathaway - historically known as Anne - following the death of their 11-year-old son. During her speech, Buckley thanked director Chloe Zhao and co-stars Paul Mescal and Emily Watson.

You're a giant of the heart and thank you so much for making me a little bit more human.\" Netflix series Adolescence, which was among the platform's most-watched titles of 2025, follows a 13-year-old boy arrested for the murder of a classmate. Adolescence star Cooper, now 16, took home the prize for best supporting actor in a limited series, while his co-stars Graham and Doherty were awarded best actor and best supporting actress in a limited series, respectively. The Critics Choice prizes are the latest in a string of awards received by the show and its cast, including several Emmys. The stars are also up for Golden Globes this weekend. \"The past year has been a complete whirlwind for me and my family,\" Cooper said in his speech. \"Honestly, it's changed our lives forever and we're forever grateful.\" Bridget Jones: Mad About the Boy picked up the award for best movie made for television, while horror film Sinners won four categories including best casting and best ensemble, and KPop Demon Hunters' lead track Golden took the prize for best song."

        "Content": "A new online and TV ban on the advertising of unhealthy food comes into full effect today after voluntary restrictions were introduced in October.\n The ban prevents ads for \"less healthy\" food and drinks that are high in saturated fat, salt and sugar (HFSS) appearing on television between 5.30am and 9pm, and online at any time. The ban applies to products that fall within 13 categories considered to play the most significant role in childhood obesity. These include soft drinks, chocolates and sweets, pizzas, cakes and ice creams, but also breakfast cereals and porridges, sandwiches, sweetened bread products and yoghurts. Politics latest: Ministers won't warn Trump over Greenland Products that belong to these categories will need to be assessed on whether they are considered \"less healthy\" using a scoring tool that considers their nutrient levels and whether they are high in saturated fat, salt and sugar. Only products that belong to one of the 13 categories and score outside the acceptable range are included in the advertising restrictions, which will be policed by the Advertising Standards Authority. \n                  Whitakers' real-life Willy Wonka on shrinkflation and the rise of chocolate-flavour bars\n                 \n                  Food safety warning issued over Dubai-style chocolate\n                 \n                  Man arrested after frozen pangolins, rats and porcupines seized in London\n                 Products that are assessed as healthier in both can still be advertised, which the government hopes will lead to changes in recipes by the food industry.

Latest figures suggest one in 10 reception-aged children is now obese, while one in five children has tooth decay by the age of five. It is estimated that obesity costs the NHS more than £11bn every year. The new plans were first announced by the Conservatives in 2021 but were pushed back twice. It comes after Health Secretary Wes Streeting announced that milkshakes and lattes will be hit with a sugar tax for the first time in a bid to tackle obesity."
